Major Mental Illnesses 
Signs and Symptoms 
 
The following is an overview of the major mental illnesses. There are many brochures 
regarding specific illnesses available from your mental health professional or community 
mental health organizations. You may not experience all of the symptoms listed for each 
illness. 
 
Who Becomes Mentally Ill? 
• It can affect anyone, regardless of age, ethnic background, income or gender. 
• One in five Canadians has or will develop a mental illness. 
• Sometimes mental illness is complicated by drug and alcohol use. 
 
Addictions and Mental Disorders 
Studies estimate that up to 50% of people who use mental health services also report 
having alcohol and drug problems. People who experience a mental illness and use 
alcohol, cannabis, or other substances excessively are said to have a “dual diagnosis” or 
“concurrent disorder”. People may use drugs or alcohol to reduce the symptoms of 
mental illness, or to lessen the side effects of prescribed medications. However, 
substance use often reduces the effectiveness of prescription drugs, can worsen 
symptoms and complicates the diagnosis, treatment and care process. It is important to 
address alcohol and drug issues as part of your recovery plan. 
 
Mood Disorders 
Depression (as a disorder on its own or a part of bipolar disorder) 
Refers to severe and prolonged feelings of discouragement, frustration and even a 
sense of despair. Multiple causes such as specific, distressing life events, a biochemical 
imbalance in the brain or persistent psychological factors such as a negative or 
pessimistic view of life.  
Common symptoms of depression: 
• Irritability. 
• Anxious mood. 
• Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much. 
• Loss of energy and excessive fatigue. 
• Physical aches and pains. 
• Diminished ability to think and concentrate. 
• Feeling bored and not interested in many aspects of your life.

Bi-Polar Disorder 
Refers to the “two poles” of the continuum of mood with alternating periods or cycles of 
mania (highs) and depression (lows) as described previously.

Schizoaffective Disorder 
This term is used when a person has both a mood disorder and a psychotic disorder 
within the same period of illness. This does not mean you have two disorders but a 
combination of symptoms. The depressive type of schizoaffective disorder is 
accompanied by symptoms such as loss of energy, concentration impairment, guilt, 
feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. At the same time, the person 
experiences psychotic symptoms such as delusions, extreme paranoia, or hearing 
voices. 
The manic type of schizoaffective disorder often takes the form of elation, with increased 
self-confidence and grandiosity. The person may feel energized, but may act 
inappropriately in social situations, and have trouble concentrating. Symptoms of 
psychosis are also present, and the person’s behaviour is markedly different from usual. 
 
Psychosis 
The word “psychosis” is used to describe conditions that affect the mind, in which there has been some 
loss of contact with reality. When someone experiences the symptoms of psychosis, their condition is 
referred to as a psychotic episode. It affects an individual’s thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Some 
people experience psychosis as a part of their mental illness or as a result of using or withdrawing from 
drugs and alcohol. It is most likely to occur in young adults. About 3 out of every 100 people experience a 
psychotic episode in their lifetime. It occurs equally in males and females and across all cultures and 
levels of socio-economic status.  
Most people make a full recovery from the experience. 
Common signs and symptoms of psychosis: 
• Disorganized or confused thinking. 
• Reduced concentration, attention 
• Reduced drive and motivation, lack of energy 
• Sleep disturbance 
• Anxiety

Treatment & Recovery 
Treatment for any mental illness, whether or not it is complicated by drug and alcohol 
misuse, should occur as soon as symptoms appear. 
Recommended treatment involves a combination of approaches: 
• EDUCATION – To help you and your family/support system understand the illness, its 
causes and effects and ways of dealing with symptoms. 
• MEDICATION – New ones are now available with fewer unpleasant side effects than 
older medications. 
• PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY OR COUNSELLING - To help you understand what is 
happening, change your lifestyle to optimize the chances for recovery and learn new 
skills such as problem solving and relaxation techniques. 
• SOCIAL, EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION SUPPORT – You may need support to 
stay at your job, or in school.   This is important so you maintain skill development 
and continuation of income and do not become cut off from friends and workmates. 
Research has shown that people who experience mental illness have fewer relapses 
when their family or other support system is involved in their care and treatment.  The 
same is true when substance misuse is involved.  If friends and family are 
knowledgeable and informed, they are in a better position to support you.
