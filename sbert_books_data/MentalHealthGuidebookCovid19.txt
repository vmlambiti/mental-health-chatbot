In the time of pandemic and constant inflow of new information about the 
number of people infected and precautionary measures, the overall level of 
anxiety (disturbance and fear) in the society is significantly raised. And this is 
indeed expected given the circumstances. Besides the fear of the infection itself, 
a vast number of people feel threatened by the upcoming existential problems, 
loss of their jobs, self-isolation or quarantine. There is an increased concern and 
worry in daily lives of people due to difficulty of getting basic groceries and 
protective equipment.
Meanwhile, despite the world's battle with pandemic, other battles have not 
ceased to exist. Persons with mental illnesses are still facing their anxiety, panic 
attacks or psychotic outbreaks. We must not forget about them and the battles 
they have led even before the pandemic started. Emotions and feelings are our 
response to both internal and external events. Therefore, the question is: What 
kind of emotions are being provoked in persons with mental difficulties in the times 
like these.
Heightened stress situations, be it wars or natural disasters, such as 
pandemic, a large world health crisis, can cause deterioration in persons with 
mental 
conditions 
even 
if 
they 
have 
been 
stable 
prior 
to 
it.
Exposure to a multitude of information that is constantly changing, information 
on number of critically ill, or deceased people can have very negative impact 
on persons with mental health issues.
It is primarily about the feeling of a loss of control over their own life which 
persons with mental health issues already struggle with and fear. Under these 
circumstances their problems can double-up while their capacity to overcome 
challenges can decrease even more than usual.
In order to truly understand the world of persons with mental issues, one needs 
to leave the criticism behind, as well as labelling and judgemental approach, 
and invite empathy and compassion in.
Their problem is real, and not the matter of being spoiled, overreacting or lacking 
discipline.
Attention-Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is an attention deficit disorder, with or without hyperactivity or 
impulsiveness that stands in the way of everyday functioning. Imagine how the person who is struggling with 
attention issues feels when listening to the information they can not focus on. That person is scatterbrained, 
tends to lose things, seems absentminded, forgets about their duties, has difficulties waiting for their turn, 
and acts inappropriately in situations where they are expected to be calm and quiet.
They can feel restless and suffer from high levels of anxiety, fear and low self-esteem which is a common 
phenomenon that appears in mental problems. Before directing them how to behave due to pandemic, 
try standing in their shoes for ten seconds at least.
How to Help?
Be aware of the fact that they are in a very 
challenging state they are facing daily while 
solving the puzzle of life.
Try to understand that this moment is 
particularly difficult for them because today's 
life challenge is new and unknown and hence 
frightening.
Do not use judgemental and commanding 
tones of voice, try offering them support and 
a shoulder lean on.
Ask them what their needs are with empathy 
and ask how can you help them do their daily 
tasks.
Remember that they often have a low self-
esteem, so point out their strengths: "You are 
so good at … .” Stay with them while they are 
completing tasks such as washing their 
hands or putting a face mask on.
They will appreciate all the support given far 
more than you may think. Be patient.
Anxiety Disorder
Persons with Anxiety Disorder can feel debilitating fear 
and disturbance, anxiety, increased muscle tension, and 
extreme caution in future planning.
They can show avoidant behaviours, experience 
frustration, panic and feel that they are dying. They have 
so called thought errors, thoughts that starts with: what 
if...I lose control, embarrass myself or lose my mind. 
They have physical sensations such as elevated heart-
rate, difficulty breathing, muscle tension, and nausea.
How to Help?
Talk about their feelings, breathe together, practice 
abdominal breathing (slow and deep breathing by 
taking even breaths) which is extremely efficient in 
calming the body and mind. Encourage them to 
focus on breathing, to slow down the breathing pace, 
to inhale deeply, hold their breath while counting to 
three before exhaling, and to focus on their breath 
circulating through their body.
This way, the mind is focused on the breath, 
disturbing thoughts are minimized and body is 
calming down. You can also practice progressive 
muscle relaxation exercises together, and you will 
feel its benefits too.
Be there with them until they calm down, and then 
introduce a plan of activities you can do together. Do 
not say things like: "You are overreacting; it's 
nothing" , etc., as in their mind everything looks 
terrifying and catastrophic even though they are 
often logically aware that is not the case. Thoughts 
can be overcome by thoughts and emotions by 
emotions.
Do not say you understand if you have not 
experienced anxiety or panic attacks yourself. Act 
with empathy, say although you know you can’t 
understand the experience, it seems terrifying, and 
that you are there for them. Refer to it as a wave of 
feelings and you will wait together for it to pass.
Create the sense of security through structure based 
little 
things 
that 
you 
can 
control 
(such 
as 
precautionary measures).
Respect their daily plan and approach with kindness 
some of their activities that may seem extreme (like 
excessive cleaning). Perhaps the activity can help 
them release some of their built up anxiety.
Bipolar Disorder
A person with Bipolar Disorder is going through dramatic mood changes, from deep depression to manic 
phase, which is a phase of extreme upswing and energy increase.
In the depressive phase, a person may feel helpless and sad, hopeless and angry and suffer from low self-
esteem. In the manic phase euphoria and delusions of grandeur are present; they feel almighty, have poor risk 
evaluation and may engage in risky behaviours.
They may have difficulties understanding their own feelings and controling their actions.
How to Help?
Try to be there for them when they lose their mental 
balance. What they need the most is empathy and 
compassion. Understanding their life and their 
reactions to life, challenges them. Knowing that you 
are there for them is helpful. Their inner battle with 
their feelings, thoughts and guilt will not be 
diminished by the present pandemic, quite the 
contrary.
Avoid saying: "Calm down, it will go away". They 
know it will pass, but in that moment it feels so 
overwhelming to them it’s as if the feelings will 
never stop. Above all, they do not want to have 
those depressive or disturbing feelings either. So 
breathe deeply with them if they are upset, hold 
their hand, suggest an activity you can do together.
When they calm down, talk to them about how they 
felt, make a plan together to prepare for the crisis 
situation next time it occurs. Show understanding 
when they can't respond equally to your need for 
support.
Remember that the state they are in is only one side 
of them and that as a person they are so much more 
than their illness. Listen, stay connected, do not 
dismiss or give up on them. Bear in mind that they 
need much bigger capacity to overcome their 
struggles than they currently have.
A person with Depressive Disorder feels sadness, emptiness and irritability, followed by physical and cognitive 
changes that significantly affect person's functioning in all areas of their life.
They can lose their interest in activities they have previously enjoyed in, experience appetite changes, sleep 
deprivation or excessive sleeping, feel worthless and guilty, have difficulties focusing and making decisions. 
Thoughts of death and suicide are common in this state, as well as overall anxiety.
Ask questions rather than making assumptions.
Respect their feelings even when they seem inappropriate or out of proportion. Remember that no one can really 
know what the other person actually feels. Hear them out and step in their shoes for ten seconds and then let 
them how that feeling seems to you.
Do not identify the person with their mental health problem.
Help them accomplish their daily plans. Remember that they will feel guilty if they do not join the planned activity. 
Their refusal to participate should not be perceived as laziness, in fact their illness reflects in the lack of 
motivation to execute the plan. Help them give their contribution to their daily lives.
Do not try to fix them or change them and do not forget that the state they are in is not their choice.

A person with a Feeding and Eating Disorder has a difficult relationship with food which greatly affects their 
psychosocial and physical well-being. They have a distorted, negative picture of their own body, and are 
preoccupied with thoughts of food, calorie counting and exercising. They are finding ways to purify their body or to 
resolve their emotions with food, using it as a shield from emotional hurt. Increased anxiety is commonly present.
Worrying about food and getting groceries, unavailability of gyms and limited sport activities can cause an 
increase in the disturbed state of mind in persons who suffer from eating disorder and therefore provoke even 
more drastic measures in their food intake control.
Make a plan of light exercises and diet 
together. Demonstrate healthy ways of taking 
care of your body.
Talk honestly and openly about your concerns.
Ignoring the problem due to new situation will 
not make it go away, in fact, it can only make it 
worse.
Pointing out that the situation in the world is 
tough will not help. Try being nurturing instead 
and remind them of their part in being 
responsible for their health.
Do not tell them to just drop it and start eating 
or to cut down the exercises. Remember that 
they are in a vicious cycle of their own thought 
and can't see the way out.
Embrace them even if they reject themselves 
and speak your mind and express feelings 
about them and their body.
Food is a body fuel and immune system 
protection, just as a mask is to the face and 
gloves to the hands. Try to represent it this 
way and avoid any connections between food 
and emotions.

Feeding and Eating Disorder
A person with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is struggling with obsessive, recurrent and persistent thoughts or 
images that they experience as intrusive and unwanted and over which they have no control. While attempting to 
establish that control, compulsions appear as another symptom. Compulsions are actions, repeated behaviours 
guided by obsessive thoughts that have to be done in a rigid manner and follow the strict rules.
Persons with OCD can be troubled by the overwhelming feeling of responsibility, exaggerated existing threats, 
intolerance and struggle dealing with the unknown.
Try to understand the heightened tension and 
disturbance they may feel in this situation 
when uncertainty is everywhere, because to 
them it seems that the threat has at least 
doubled in intensity.
Try to accept that their tension increases when 
they do not perform the activity that they feel 
they are forced to perform.
Do not do those activities with them, do not 
support them, try talking about how they feel 
instead. Talk about their feelings, ask them 
what disturbs them the most in this situation 
and what makes their OCD worse.
Feel free to analyse those thoughts together. 
Do not criticise,do not judge and do not 
compare their inner world with a state the 
world is in at this moment.
Try to keep their daily routine unchanged, daily 
planning can help.

Personality Disorder
How to Help?
Persons with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder have abnormalities in one or several of the following domains: delusions, 
unrealistic beliefs, hallucinations, disorganised thinking (speech), disorganised or abnormal motor behaviour. They feel excessive 
anxiety and need for social isolation even in times when that is not a necessary precaution. They often carry the weight of stigma 
(judging, misunderstanding, fear) that is imposed on them by society. Their inner world can be as tense, chaotic and frightening as 
if there were a constantly present crisis situation similar to the one that is happening now.
Presence of hallucinations, whether they be visual, auditory or tactile, causes tremendous fear. Other symptoms can cause an 
extreme decrease in motivation such as lack of will for basic grooming. Symptoms also make it difficult to accept and understand 
new information.
The fact that they are in a state that triggers specific emotional processes does not mean that they don't have the ability to feel just 
as intensely as everyone else. They also have difficulties with anticipation of pleasure, or rather with expecting future positive 
events or experiences to occur, and with taking pleasure in imagining future pleasures.
Make a precise structure of the day, daily errands 
and activities.
Make an effort to create a supportive and stable 
environment in order to reduce the feeling of 
stress.
Establish realistic expectations, but do not do 
things on their behalf. Let them do their tasks 
themselves, stay with them as a support only.
Track their regular medicine intake. Prepare for 
the crisis situation to happen. Be aware that you 
cannot do everything alone, have all the 
emergency contacts handy.
Do not express anger or fury, remember that your 
loved ones can be terrified of their own symptoms 
and of the pandemic as well. Sit down, talk in 
calming voice and ask for a permission if you 
want to touch or hug them.
Remove all the distractions, such as TV and 
radio, and choose the time to get informed 
yourself, while away from the person you are 
taking care of. Try to process your own emotional 
reaction first, before you inform the person with a 
mental 
disorder 
of 
the 
new 
precautionary 
measures.

Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder
A person with Sleep-Wake Disorders is deeply dissatisfied with quality, time and duration of their sleep. This 
leads to heightened stress levels and affects the person's general skillset negatively. During daytime, person can 
feel anxious, have difficulty focusing and have an increased self-criticism as they are failing to fulfil their daily 
tasks.
Make a sleep diary and search together for potential causes of the condition. Establish what was different in days 
when the person slept well and try repeating the same activities typical for good days.
Introduce daily activities and tasks routine and particularly make sure there are enough exercises, physical 
activities, breathing exercising and regular healthy meals.
Make sure their evenings are peaceful. If you can, during isolation and quarantine, do not use the same space for 
daily activities and sleeping.
Avoid news and information after 8 pm. Choose a room where they can go if they can not fall asleep so that their 
mind makes a connection between bed and sleep. Do not disturb their sleep additionally by criticising, but rather 
encourage them to play quiet music or read a book while falling asleep. Talk about the feelings daily as 
suppressed feelings and unresolved issues can be a reason for racing thoughts that disturb the sleep.
Allow yourself and them to live in the here and now and plan a day when you will not be thinking about the 
consequences the pandemic will have on your lives and the world. That is all that we can do at this moment.

A person with one of the Substance Related and Addictive Disorders lives in a vicious cycle of addiction where the 
priority is to satisfy the urge for a substance, to gamble, internet addiction or similar addictive behaviours.
They manifest unhealthy egocentrism, selfishness (everything serves the addiction), irresponsibility, lack of concern 
for both themselves and their loved ones.
Be aware that addiction is an illness rather than a fad, whim or a vice. Unhealthy egocentrism and maintaining the 
relationship with addiction puts even their own lives in the shadow of addiction. Regardless of the current situation in 
the world, their condition will not go away without adequate professional help.
Do not attach their provocations, impulsiveness, lies and irresponsibility to yourself or your relationship. They are all 
part of the illness.
Regardless of the pandemic, if you are in any way in danger or exposed to abuse, get professional help (protection 
services are still available). Danger for you and your loved one is significantly higher if you remain in the addiction 
situation.
Addictive Disorders

The person with Trauma and Stress 
Related Disorders (such as PTSD) may 
feel shame, guilt and anger, they can 
experience panic, anxiety, depression and 
have suicidal thoughts and behaviours. 
Situations where the danger is present can 
trigger stressful memories and increase old 
fears. That way, a person experiences 
double stress, the one coming from the 
present danger and the other through 
reliving the danger the person used to be 
exposed to.
Remember that the triggers can come from 
both 
outside 
(news, 
constant 
new 
information on the number of deceased, 
etc.)and inside (hunger, pain, any physical 
sensation, feeling of being trapped and 
vulnerability). 
If person is taking medications, make sure 
it is done regularly.

Universal Help Guidelines
Get information about your loved one’s issues. Knowledge will help you understand a person with a 
disorder better. Avoid identifying them with the problem and find the appropriate way to help and protect 
yourself.
Seek professional help. The pandemic should not be a reason not to ask for a psychiatrist’s or therapist's 
help. Many issues will be more visible now when members of the family spend more time with each other 
and share the common space. Use this opportunity to find the adequate help for your loved one.
Mental health issues are not a reason to condemn, label or identify a person through a problem.
Try approaching it as you would with any other physical disease. Seeking professional help is always a 
sign of inner strength, courage and wisdom rather than weakness or powerlessness.
Remember that you are not their therapist and that you cannot and need not fulfill that role. Your emotional 
involvement is naturally standing in the way of it. Neither you, nor your loved one can make it on your own. 
There is no reason for someone to struggle and bear the consequences when there are possible solutions. 
If your close one is already part of the therapeutic process and has regular check-ups, do not avoid seeing 
a psychiatrist or psychotherapist due to pandemic specifically. Even if they cannot go in person, visits can 
be arranged by the phone or online.
Do not neglect tasks for recovery that they have already started. Make a strategy for their fulfilment and 
evaluate achievements once a week. By doing so they will feel pleasure and sense of regaining control.
Make daily and weekly routines, follow a plan and motivate the person with a mental disorder to participate 
in making these. Establish plan writing as a family norm by making one for yourself or together with the 
whole family. Repeat calmly multiple times what the precautionary measures are. Do not expect their focus 
and attention span to suddenly become better just because the situation is serious.
Remember that persons with mental health problems often have a constant feeling of doom in their inner 
world as well as in their social circles. Stand by them.
Normalise the quarantine and self-isolation and point out that in the moment like this, it is the least 
everyone can do for themselves and others. Pandemic is the world's issue, hence try to stress the 
universality of this problem. Try to mention positive stories too, for example those of people who recovered 
from the virus successfully.
Do not neglect regularity of pharmaceutical therapy.
In the case you fall ill, inform your nearest medical centre or service that your close one needs 
psychiatric support and that you can't be there for them temporarily. If available, try engaging someone 
from the family, friends or neighbours into taking care of your loved one.
Do not overwhelm yourself or anyone around you with information on pandemic. You can stay well-
informed even if you don't listen to news or read website contents multiple times a day. Avoid starting 
and ending your day with information, except in the case of emergency. Dedicate one hour in your day to 
getting informed. Find one close friend, for example, that is reliable, mature and reasonable and let them 
be your source of information. Persons with anxiety disorder symptoms can drastically worsen with 
exposure to large quantities of information.
If a person has suicidal thoughts or behaviours, contact the nearest mental health help service 
immediately. Do not underestimate importance of these thoughts just because it's a pandemic. Even if it 
seems unrealistic in this moment, don't forget that this is a person who fights with similarly hard and high-
risk situations in their minds daily. Perhaps the anticipation of the future pleasures are not going to be 
possible or comforting for the person. Do not insist on them if your close one doesn't react positively to 
them. Draw their attention to other daily activities; talk in a calming voice.
Maybe you will have to set stricter boundaries in order to protect the person from exposure to risky 
behaviours (particularly in addiction and bipolar disorder). Try not to do it in a rough or dismissive 
manner.
Do not undermine the power of a soothing voice, hug and touch. Physical contact has a calming effect. 
Express your feelings so that they understand that it is a desirable thing to do. Organise virtual dinners or 
tea parties and include the person with mental health issues too. Seek professional help if you are 
struggling yourself.
If you are exposed to violence or threat of violence, seek immediate help. Do not evaluate whether the 
risk of virus or violence is more damaging. Keep your help line numbers in a visible spot. Take care of 
yourself and rely on other people too as much as you can. Whenever you can, find the time for your own 
relaxation, eat well, try to get regular sleep and exercise.
Professional help is available for you too as a support. If you feel exhausted and overwhelmed or have 
increased anxiety, seek a therapist for yourself because you deserve it and it is your right.
