Preface
One	of	the	most	neglected	great	books	of	the
Western	 world	 is	 A	 Dictionary	 of	 the	 English
Language,	first	published	in	1755.	The	author,	the
genius	 Samuel	 Johnson,	 introduced	 this	 work	 by
stating,	 “He	 that	 undertakes	 to	 compile	 a
Dictionary,	
undertakes	
that,	
which,	
if	
it
comprehends	 the	 full	 extent	 of	 his	 design,	 he
knows	himself	unable	to	perform.	Yet	his	labours,
though	deficient,	may	be	useful,	and	with	the	hope
of	 this	 inferior	 praise,	 he	 must	 incite	 his	 activity
and	solace	his	weariness”	(p.	xiii).	Reddick	(1990)
outlines	 in	 detail	 the	 enormous	 dedication	 and
enterprise	
that	
Johnson	
devoted	
to	
this
extraordinary	accomplishment.
In	 this	 dictionary	 for	 psychotherapists,	 with
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
16
the	ideal	of	Samuel	Johnson	hovering	unattainably
above	me,	I	attempt	to	address	the	same	difficulty
that	he	(1773)	describes:
When	 I	 took	 the	 first	 survey	 of	 my
undertaking,	 I	 found	 our	 speech	 copious
without	 order,	 and	 energetic	 without	 rules;
wherever	 I	 turned	 my	 view,	 there	 was
perplexity	to	be	disentangled,	and	confusion
to	be	regulated;	choice	was	to	be	made	out	of
boundless	 variety	 without	 any	 established
principle	of	selection;	adulterations	were	to
be	detected,	without	a	subtle	test	of	purity;
and	 modes	 of	 expression	 to	 be	 rejected	 or
received,	 without	 the	 suffrages	 of	 any
writers	
of	
classical	
reputation	
or
acknowledged	authority,	[p.	iii]
Setting	out	to	produce	a	practical	guide	for	the	use
of	experienced	psychotherapists,	as	well	as	mental
health	 professionals	 in	 various	 stages	 of	 their
training,	 I	 decided	 to	 render	 it	 as	 much	 in
narrative	 form	 as	 possible.	 The	 approach	 of	 this
dictionary	is	designed	so	that	the	reader	may	look
up	any	term	he	or	she	finds	puzzling	by	reference
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
17
to	the	simple	alphabetical	order	of	the	book	or	in
the	 table	 of	 contents,	 while	 at	 the	 same	 time	 a
dedicated	 clinician	 or	 student	 who	 wishes	 an
overview	of	practical	problems	in	psychotherapy
can	read	the	book	from	cover	to	cover	because	of
its	format.	A	name	index	has	also	been	included	at
the	 end	 for	 those	 who	 wish	 to	 examine	 the
contributions	 of	 any	 individual	 thinker	 to	 our
discipline,	 but	 I	 have	 restricted	 the	 selection	 of
famous	 names	 to	 some	 of	 those	 who	 are	 often
cited	in	current	unresolved	issues.
In	devising	this	format,	I	have	made	no	effort
to	be	inclusive	of	the	innumerable	terms	and	the
infinite	 variety	 of	 their	 usage	 in	 our	 field,	 but
rather	to	express,	on	the	basis	of	thirty-five	years
of	 clinical	 experience,	 the	 way	 I	 have	 used	 these
terms	 and	 to	 provide	 the	 best	 or	 optimal
understanding	that	I	may	convey	to	the	practicing
psychotherapist.	
In	
discussing	
the	
various
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
18
concepts	 involved,	 I	 have	 elected	 to	 stay	 with
clinical	 material	 and	 avoid	 long	 and	 tedious
abstract	
or	
theoretical	
metapsychological
controversies.	 I	 have	 necessarily	 been	 selective,
choosing	 those	 terms	 from	 the	 psychiatric,
psychoanalytic,	medical,	philosophical,	and	artistic
vocabulary	
that	
have	
immediate	
practical
significance.	 In	 so	 doing,	 I	 hope	 to	 offer	 the
comprehensive	 reader	 a	 large	 number	 of	 useful
clinical	 ideas	 that	 are	 suggested	 by	 the	 terms	 I
have	emphasized	in	this	dictionary.	The	aim	would
be	 not	 only	 to	 improve	 and	 sharpen	 the
vocabulary	of	the	practicing	psychotherapist,	but
also	 to	 provide	 the	 clinician	 with	 the	 everyday
practical	use	of	this	terminology.	I	hope	this	will
facilitate	the	actual	practice	of	the	art	and	craft	of
psychotherapy	as	well	as	instruct	student	mental
health	 professionals.	 These	 choices	 and	 my
approach	 lead	 me	 to	 share	 Johnson’s	 (1773)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
19
concern:
That	 part	 of	 my	 work	 on	 which	 I	 expect
malignity	 most	 frequently	 to	 fasten,	 is	 the
Explanation;	 in	 which	 I	 cannot	 hope	 to
satisfy	 those,	 who	 are	 perhaps	 not	 inclined
to	be	pleased,	since	I	have	not	always	been
able	 to	 satisfy	 myself.	 To	 interpret	 a
language	 by	 itself	 is	 very	 difficult.…	 When
the	 nature	 of	 things	 is	 unknown	 or	 the
notion	unsettled	and	indefinite,	and	various
in	 various	 minds,	 the	 words	 by	 which	 such
notions	 are	 conveyed,	 or	 such	 things
denoted,	 will	 be	 ambiguous	 and	 perplexed,
[p.	vii]
Some	 of	 the	 pioneer	 attempts	 at	 a	 dictionary
for	 mental	 health	 professionals	 are	 those	 by
Eidelberg	 (1968),	 English	 and	 English	 (1958),
Fodor	 and	 Gaynor	 (1950),	 and	 more	 recently
Walrond-Skinner	 (1986).	 I	 have	 leaned	 more	 at
times	 on	 certain	 other	 specialized	 texts,	 such	 as
those	 by	 Rycroft	 (1968),	 Laplanche	 and	 Pontalis
(1973),	Moore	and	Fine	(1990),	Campbell	(1989),
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
20
and	Hinshelwood	(1989).
Rycroft	 (1968)	 lists	 some	 of	 the	 “linguistic
stumbling-blocks”	
to	
gaining	
entry	
to	
the
psychoanalytic	 literature.	 The	 use	 of	 abstract
explanatory	concepts	while	describing	facts	leads
to	 a	 misuse	 of	 jargon	 and	 a	 writing	 of	 case
histories	 with	 reported	 facts	 presented	 only
through	 a	 theoretical	 haze.	 This	 makes	 it
impossible	 for	 the	 reader	 to	 grasp	 in	 everyday
language	the	material	presented,	which	might	then
have	been	explained	in	some	other	way.	Technical
jargon	can	easily	be	used	to	construct	theories	that
are	 consistent	 and	 intellectually	 satisfying,	 “not
because	they	really	explain	the	facts	but	because
the	 definitions	 of	 the	 technical	 terms	 interlock
beautifully”	(p.	xi).	Jargon	often	is	used	to	conceal
ignorance.	 Psychiatrists,	 according	 to	 Rycroft,
“following	 a	 long-established	 medical	 tradition,
are	more	often	guilty	of	this	form	of	unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
21
deception	than	are	the	analysts,	the	procedure	or
trick	being	to	translate	the	patient’s	complaint	into
Greek	 and	 then	 assure	 him	 that	 his	 troubles	 are
due	 to	 an	 illness	 with	 an	 outlandish	 and	 exotic
name”	(p.	xii).
In	 the	 preparation	 of	 a	 dictionary,	 an
important	 objective	 is	 what	 Basch	 (1973)	 has
called	“expression”	(p.	47)	and	Langer	(1962)	“the
presentation	of	an	idea,	usually	by	the	proper	and
apt	use	of	words”	(p.	78).	Unfortunately,	instead	of
a	 common	 language,	 there	 exists	 an	 “increasing
psychoanalytic	
diversity	
...	
a	
pluralism	
of
theoretical	perspectives,	of	linguistic	and	thought
conventions,	 of	 distinctive	 regional,	 cultural,	 and
language	 emphases”	 (Wallerstein	 1988,	 p.	 5).	 To
make	matters	even	more	complex,	Moore	and	Fine
(1990)	point	out	Freud’s	conceptual	inconsistency
and	poetic	word	play,	leading	to	an	ambiguity	and
flexibility	in	his	writings	“that	enabled	him	to	say
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
22
several	different	things	at	the	same	time.…	Freud
communicated	 his	 concepts	 via	 consummate	 use
of	vivid	and	emotionally	compelling	language.…	He
did	not	adhere	to	precise	definitions	of	technical
terms”	 (p.	 xxi).	 Furthermore,	 the	 translation	 of
Freud	 by	 Strachey	 in	 the	 mid-1960s	 consistently
replaced	 Freud’s	 affect-laden	 everyday	 German
words	
with	
a	
more	
scientific-sounding
terminology	
and	
changed	
Freud’s	
dynamic
concepts	 into	 “static,	 passive”	 ones	 (p.	 xxi).
Strachey	
apparently	
believed	
that	
he	
had
improved	on	and	presented	a	definitive	version	of
Freud’s	 thinking,	 but	 there	 is	 considerable
controversy	 on	 that	 subject	 at	 the	 present	 time
(Ornston	1985).
Anyone	wishing	to	explore	these	matters	more
fully	and	with	greater	scholastic	rigor	is	referred
to	 Moore	 and	 Fine’s	 glossary	 (1990)	 for
psychoanalytic	 terms	 and	 concepts,	 and	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
23
Campbell’s	fine	psychiatric	dictionary	(1989).	The
latter	 is	 presented	 in	 the	 format	 of	 a	 typical
medical	
dictionary,	
offering	
relatively	
brief
definitions	 and	 discussions,	 and	 not	 written	 in	 a
narrative	form.	The	former	is	more	technical	and
carefully	
geared	
to	
the	
psychoanalyst	
or
psychoanalytically	 oriented	 psychotherapist	 who
wishes	 to	 gain	 some	 metapsychological	 depth	 in
this	 terminology,	 and	 it	 provides	 references	 for
even	further	investigation	in	detail.	Laplanche	and
Pontalis	 (1973)	 offer	 a	 less	 useful	 compendium,
which	 traces	 psychoanalytic	 terminology	 from	 a
more	European	orientation,	and	includes	concepts
that	are	obsolete.	The	major	value	of	their	work	is
for	those	interested	in	the	terminology	of	various
psychoanalytic	movements,	but	it	will	not	be	very
helpful	to	the	everyday	practicing	clinician.
This	book	is	intended	for	the	clinician.	In	the
immortal	prose	of	Samuel	Johnson	(1773):
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
24
To	have	attempted	much	is	always	laudable,
even	 when	 the	 enterprise	 is	 above	 the
strength	that	undertakes	it:	To	rest	below	his
own	 aim	 is	 incident	 to	 every	 one	 whose
fancy	 is	 active,	 and	 whose	 views	 are
comprehensive;	 nor	 is	 any	 man	 satisfied
with	 himself	 because	 he	 has	 much,	 but
because	 he	 can	 conceive	 little.	 …	 Thus	 it
happens,	 that	 in	 things	 difficult	 there	 is
danger	 from	 ignorance,	 and	 in	 things	 easy
from	 confidence;	 the	 mind,	 afraid	 of
greatness,	and	disdainful	of	littleness,	hastily
withdraws	herself	from	painful	searches,	and
passes	with	scornful	rapidity	over	tasks	not
adequate	 to	 her	 powers,	 sometimes	 too
secure	for	caution,	and	again	too	anxious	for
vigorous	 effort;	 sometimes	 idle	 in	 a	 plain
path,	and	sometimes	distracted	in	labyrinths,
and	 dissipated	 by	 different	 intentions,	 [pp.

A
ABANDONMENT	NEUROSIS
This	is	an	excellent	term	with	which	to	begin	a
dictionary	for	psychotherapists.	The	concept	of	the
“neuroses	 of	 abandonment”	 was	 introduced	 by
Odier	(1956)	in	a	book	entitled	Anxiety	and	Magic
Thinking,	 which	 deserves	 more	 attention	 than	 it
has	 received.	 Odier	 regarded	 the	 anxiety	 of	 the
patients	 we	 call	 “borderline”	 today	 as	 directly
proportional	to	the	amount	of	insecurity	in	early
childhood,	producing	regression	to	the	prelogical
stage	of	infantile	thinking.	He	described	this	magic
thinking	in	detail	as	involving	(a)	objectification	of
fear:	“Whatever	threatens	me	is	wicked,	whatever
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
29
protects	me	is	good”;	(b)	objectification	of	anger—
toward	 animistic	 malevolent	 objects	 as	 chosen;
and	 (c)	 identification	 with	 the	 aggressor.	 The
“objectification”	 is	 the	 magical	 defense,	 which
places	the	anxiety	and	fear	and	anger	outside	the
psyche	 onto	 external	 objects,	 as	 in	 phobias,	 or
onto	 fantasy	 objects,	 as	 in	 nightmares	 and
religious	preoccupations	or	guru-inspired	cults.
In	the	neuroses	of	abandonment,	the	anxiety	is
objectified	onto	a	human	being	instead	of	a	cosmic
image	 or	 a	 transitional	 object—a	 human	 being
who	 is	 then	 given	 the	 power	 of	 creating	 or
abolishing	
abandonment,	
insecurity,	
or
helplessness.	 This	 individual	 is	 seen	 as	 all-
powerful,	
sometimes	
benevolent,	
sometimes
malevolent.	 In	 this	 situation,	 the	 oscillation
between	 love	 and	 hate,	 security	 and	 insecurity,
dependency	
and	
paranoia,	
and	
the	
rapid
transitions	 from	 euphoria	 to	 depression,	 all	 as	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
30
function	 of	 minor	 provocations	 or	 reassurances
from	the	chosen	object,	lead	to	the	typical	picture
of	 the	 borderline	 patient	 and	 the	 common
phenomena	described	as	part	of	narcissistic	object
relations.
The	
purpose	
of	
this	
magical	
thinking,
according	 to	 Odier,	 is	 as	 a	 defense	 against	 the
recurrence	of	deception,	the	fear	of	the	feeling	of
abandonment	
arising	
from	
early,	
mostly
preoedipal	 childhood	 experiences.	 Leuba	 (1949)
introduced	rather	metaphorically	the	concept	of	a
“phobia	of	penetration,”	which	means	the	fear	in
each	 living	 being	 of	 being	 penetrated	 and
destroyed.	 He	 depicted	 by	 this	 concept	 an
elementary	fear	and	threat	to	the	integrity	of	the
body,	“the	fear	of	the	cut-up	body,”	and	believed
that	 all	 manifestations	 of	 this	 fear	 are	 identical
with	 the	 concept	 that	 Odier	 called	 “primary
phobias”	 that	 lie	 at	 the	 basis	 of	 the	 neuroses	 of

abandonment.
The	 clinician	 should	 remember	 that	 behind
many	 of	 these	 psychoanalytic	 and	 psychiatric
concepts	as	they	appear	in	psychotherapy	lies	the
fear	of	the	four	major	calamities	of	childhood:	loss
of	the	love	object,	loss	of	the	mother’s	love,	fear	of
castration,	 and	 guilt	 that	 demands	 punishment
(Brenner	 1982).	 These	 are	 usually	 telescoped
together	 in	 our	 clinical	 work	 as	 the	 patients
present	their	material,	and	it	is	only	with	careful
exploratory	 study	 that	 we	 are	 able	 to	 ascertain
what	 is	 fundamental	 and	 what	 represents
regression.

ABREACTION
This	represents	the	discharge	of	emotion	that
was	attached	to	a	previously	repressed	memory	as
it	emerges	into	the	consciousness.	Abreaction	was
originally	 thought	 to	 be	 therapeutic	 in	 itself	 and
was	 a	 central	 concept	 in	 the	 early	 days	 of
psychoanalysis.	 Even	 today	 we	 recognize	 that	 a
therapeutic	 effect	 can	 occur	 through	 the	 partial
discharge	of	painful	emotions,	which	allows	for	a
desensitization	to	them.	Abreaction	was	originally
induced	using	the	process	of	hypnosis	by	Breuer
and	Freud,	and	the	best	reference	on	the	subject	is
Breuer	 and	 Freud’s	 (1893-1895)	 Studies	 on
Hysteria.
Freud	thought	that	abreaction,	whether	it	was
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
33
brought	 about	 by	 hypnosis	 or	 simply	 by	 the
therapist’s	 persuasion,	 would	 cure	 hysterical
symptoms	through	a	kind	of	purging	or	catharsis
analogous	 to	 cleaning	 out	 an	 abscess.	 It	 is	 no
longer	 a	 central	 goal	 in	 psychotherapy	 or
psychoanalysis	(Caper	1992).	The	entire	approach
of	 using	 hypnosis	 in	 psychotherapy	 for	 anything
but	the	most	superficial	symptom	removal	is	to	be
thought	of	as	questionable,	except	in	experimental
or	research	situations.
Abreaction	 is	 sometimes	 a	 goal	 of	 brief
psychotherapies,	
especially	
in	
treating	
a
posttraumatic	stress	disorder	and	focusing	on	the
discussion	and	reliving	of	the	experience.

ABSTINENCE
Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 abstinence	 as
the	 “forbearance	 of	 any	 thing”	 (p.	 12),	 or	 the
forbearance	 of	 necessary	 food.	 He	 reminds	 us	 of
Shakespeare’s	 line	 in	 Love's	 Labor	 Lost:	 “And
abstinence	engenders	maladies.”	This	term	is	often
confused	 and	 used	 in	 several	 ways.	 The	 literal
meaning	 of	 the	 term	 is	 simply	 the	 denying	 of
gratification.	 For	 example,	 in	 the	 area	 of	 drug
dependency,	the	state	of	being	without	the	drug	is
a	state	of	abstinence.	Thus,	withdrawal	symptoms
are	sometimes	called	the	“abstinence	syndrome.”
In	psychoanalytic	treatment	the	term	came	to
be	
employed	
by	
Freud	
(1915)	
in	
his
recommendation	that	the	treatment	be	carried	out
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
35
in	 a	 state	 of	 abstinence,	 implying	 that	 since	 the
symptoms	 were	 gratifying,	 a	 level	 of	 frustration
should	 be	 preserved	 as	 optimal	 for	 a	 treatment
response.	 The	 analyst	 came	 to	 be	 enjoined	 even
more	by	subsequent	psychoanalytic	authorities	to
oppose	 those	 activities	 and	 pleasures	 of	 the
patient	that	drained	off	anxiety	by	giving	pleasure.
This	 led	 to	 confusion	 because	 some	 therapists
understood	it	to	mean	that	the	patient	should	even
be	 asked	 to	 refrain	 from	 all	 personal	 sexual
activity	during	the	therapy.
The	proper	meaning	of	the	rule	of	abstinence
as	it	is	used	in	uncovering	psychotherapy	is	that,
unless	 it	 is	 done	 for	 a	 very	 specific	 purpose,	 the
therapist	 should	 not	 deliberately	 gratify	 the
patient	 to	 any	 significant	 degree	 during	 the
treatment.	It	does	not	refer	to	having	the	therapist
command	the	patient	to	abstain	from	nonharmful
gratifications	outside	the	therapy	office.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
36
Unfortunately,	the	so-called	rule	of	abstinence
has	never	been	made	clear	and	lends	itself	to	use
by	a	sadistic	therapist	or	a	therapist	who	has	some
sort	 of	 countertransference	 problem	 to	 justify
unreasonable	withholding	from	the	patient.	If	this
is	carried	to	an	extreme,	it	produces	an	iatrogenic
narcissism,	 the	 withdrawal	 of	 the	 patient	 into	 a
self-contained	 grandiosity,	 which	 often	 gets	 the
patient	 labeled	 as	 a	 narcissistic	 personality
disorder.	Even	more	unfortunately,	it	can	lead	to
serious	acting	out	behavior	by	borderline	patients
who	 cannot	 contain	 their	 rage	 at	 the	 therapist’s
distance	and	coldness.
I	think	what	Freud	meant	is	that	the	therapist
should	maintain	a	benign	neutrality	in	his	or	her
work	 with	 a	 patient.	 This	 means	 treating	 the
patient	as	one	would	treat	any	human	being	who
is	 a	 guest	 in	 one’s	 home	 or	 one’s	 office,	 but	 it
should	be	kept	in	mind	that	this	is	a	formal	guest,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
37
not	a	member	of	one’s	family.	There	is	an	almost
absolute	contraindication	to	any	form	of	physical
contact	 with	 patients	 for	 any	 reason	 whatsoever
except	in	the	most	extreme	emergency	situations.
In	 my	 supervisory	 experience	 psychotherapists
have	 engaged	 in	 an	 unfortunate	 plethora	 of
physical	 contact,	 such	 as	 hugging,	 massaging,	 or
hand	 holding,	 all	 of	 which	 definitely	 violates	 the
rule	 of	 abstinence.	 Any	 form	 of	 physical	 contact
with	patients	inevitably	stirs	up	a	host	of	desires,
transferences,	and	countertransferences,	and	must
be	regarded	as	countertransference	acting	out	by
the	 therapist	 regardless	 of	 the	 rationalization
employed,	and	regardless	of	the	amount	of	clamor
coming	from	the	patient	for	gratification.
The	
avoidance	
of	
gratification	
in	
the
transference	fosters	regression	and	facilitates	the
emergence,	recognition,	and	understanding	of	the
transference.	 It	 follows	 that	 in	 supportive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
38
psychotherapy,	where	one’s	goal	is	simply	to	make
the	patient	feel	better,	the	therapist	does	a	good
deal	 more	 gratifying	 by	 explanations,	 teaching,
and	 verbal	 activity	 than	 in	 a	 psychoanalytic
treatment.	There	is	no	agreement	as	to	how	much
abstinence	 is	 optimal	 in	 a	 treatment,	 but	 it	 is
usually	 individualized	 to	 fit	 the	 situation	 of	 the
patient	at	any	given	time.	An	important	part	of	the
art	of	psychotherapy	is	to	neither	overgratify	nor
undergratify	the	patient	so	as	to	avoid	the	pitfalls
of	each	of	these	countertransference	mistakes.
This	is	not	as	difficult	as	it	sounds,	in	spite	of
Freud’s	 ambiguity	 of	 the	 concept,	 because	 it
depends	 largely	 on	 the	 successful	 personal
psychoanalysis	 of	 the	 therapist.	 One	 of	 the	 most
common	 causes	 of	 destructive	 or	 stalemated
psychotherapies	 is	 a	 lack	 of	 sufficient	 thorough
and	deep	personal	psychoanalysis	of	the	therapist,
and	it	is	in	the	area	of	abstinence	and	gratification
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
39
that	these	difficulties	often	begin.	Patients	present
us	 with	 innumerable	 pitfalls	 and	 seductions	 in
order	to	reenact	their	neuroses	with	us,	and	it	is
our	 responsibility	 as	 therapists	 to	 be	 sufficiently
free	of	our	personal	difficulties	so	as	to	be	able	to
maintain	a	neutral	stance,	equidistant	from	the	id,
ego,	 and	 superego	 of	 the	 patient.	 This	 does	 not
imply	 or	 justify	 discourteous	 or	 insensitive
language,	prolonged	or	unnatural	silences,	or	rude
behavior	on	the	part	of	any	therapist.	See	Dewald
(1992)	for	a	traditional	description	and	defense	of
the	 psychoanalytic	 concept	 of	 abstinence	 as	 it	 is
currently	employed	in	clinical	treatment.

ACTING	OUT
This	 term	 is	 not	 to	 be	 used,	 as	 it	 often	 is	 in
everyday	 language,	 to	 label	 what	 the	 therapist
considers	 to	 be	 misbehavior	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the
patient.	 Although	 it	 is	 used	 by	 many	 authors	 in
different	 ways,	 it	 does	 have	 a	 basic	 technical
meaning,	 which	 was	 first	 delineated	 by	 Freud
(1913).	 Freud	 writes,	 “The	 patient	 does	 not
remember	 anything	 of	 what	 he	 has	 forgotten	 or
repressed,	but	acts	it	out.	He	reproduces	it	not	as
memory	but	as	an	action;	he	repeats	it	without,	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
41
course,	knowing	that	he	is	repeating	it”	(p.	150).
It	 is	 essential	 that	 the	 therapist	 have	 a	 clear
grasp	of	acting	out,	because	this	type	of	resistance
probably	 represents	 the	 clearest	 danger	 to	 any
psychotherapy	 and	 can	 easily	 break	 up	 a
treatment.	The	acting	out	patient	does	not	confine
conflicts	within	himself	or	herself	but	externalizes
them	 rather	 directly.	 The	 inability	 to	 internalize
and	 confine	 one’s	 conflicts	 is	 what	 Bird	 (1957)
calls	the	“pathognomonic	functional	defect,”	which
distinguishes	the	acting	out	patient	from	all	other
people.	This	developmental	defect,	he	says,	comes
out	of	a	failure	of	the	ego	of	the	child	and	of	the
mother	 to	 move	 apart.	 What	 we	 experience	 in
psychotherapy	is	not	so	much	the	predominantly
acting	 out	 patient,	 but	 acting	 out	 as	 it	 occurs	 as
resistance	during	the	process	of	psychotherapy	of
a	 patient	 who	 does	 not	 significantly	 and
continuously	 act	 out.	 These	 are	 the	 conditions
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
42
under	 which	 a	 psychotherapy	 can	 suddenly	 and
unexpectedly	be	threatened	with	destruction.
Acting	 out	 as	 a	 resistance	 in	 psychotherapy
may	 occur	 as	 a	 response	 to	 an	 interpretation,
especially	
a	
wild	
interpretation	
or	
an
interpretation	that	has	been	made	prematurely	or
without	sufficient	preparation.	An	example	of	this
can	be	found	in	any	supervisory	experience	with
neophyte	therapists.	For	instance,	a	therapist	who
deals	 too	 quickly	 with	 and	 vigorously	 offers
interpretations	of	a	schizophrenic	patient’s	affect
hunger	 or	 starvation	 for	 love	 and	 affection	 may
find	
the	
patient	
responding	
by	
sudden
hyperphagia:	the	patient	begins	to	eat	voraciously
day	and	night	or,	alternately,	may	suddenly	refuse
to	eat	and	actually	go	into	a	state	of	starvation	or
anorexia.	 What	 has	 happened	 is	 that	 rather	 than
having	to	deal	with	the	unbearably	painful	feelings
of	starvation	for	love	aroused	by	the	neophyte,	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
43
patient	
switches	
the	
whole	
arena	
to	
the
gastrointestinal	tract	and	then	acts	out	either	the
starvation	or	intense	defenses	against	the	wish	to
take	 in,	 by	 dramatic	 behavior	 relating	 to	 the
gastrointestinal	tract.
So-called	borderline	patients	when	they	act	out
tend	to	do	so	very	dramatically	and	can	often	get
themselves	into	a	great	deal	of	difficulty	before	the
therapist	is	even	aware	of	it.	Considerable	acting
out	 with	 a	 third	 person	 may	 occur	 before	 the
patient	can	finally	be	persuaded	that	this	is	really
a	shift	of	fantasies	away	from	the	therapy,	which
are	 then	 acted	 out	 and	 produce	 a	 draining	 of
affects	that	belong	in	the	therapy	situation.
Acting	out	represents	the	partial	discharge	of
drive	 tensions,	 achieved	 by	 responding	 to	 the
present	 situation	 as	 if	 it	 were	 the	 situation	 that
originally	gave	rise	to	the	drive	demand;	thus	it	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
44
a	 displacement	 of	 behavioral	 response	 from	 one
situation	to	another.	The	character	structure	of	a
person	 may	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 set	 of	 habitual
patterns	 of	 reaction	 that	 develops	 as	 a	 result	 of
conflict	 between	 the	 drives	 and	 the	 frustrating
outer	world.	This	originates	in	the	family	situation
but	may	be	preserved	throughout	life	as	a	typical
method	 of	 reacting	 to	 any	 stress	 or	 frustration.
There	 is	 no	 insight	 into	 these	 behavior	 patterns;
the	important	issue	is	not	whether	it	occurs	in	or
out	 of	 the	 analyst’s	 office	 (when	 it	 occurs	 in	 the
analyst’s	office	it	is	sometimes	called	“acting	in”)
but	to	discover	what	is	reproduced	in	the	action
rather	 than	 remembered	 and	 verbalized	 (see
Boesky	1982).
In	very	primitive	preoedipal	disorders	it	may
not	be	possible	for	the	patient	to	verbalize	what	is
being	 reproduced	 in	 the	 action,	 and	 it	 may	 be
necessary	for	the	therapist	to	help	articulate	this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
45
with	 the	 patient.	 Some	 of	 these	 early	 preverbal
situations	 can	 produce	 very	 bizarre	 action
patterns	 that	 seem	 totally	 irrational	 to	 both	 the
patient	and	the	therapist.
The	presence	of	such	extraordinary	behavioral
patterns,	
whether	
on	
a	
microscopic	
or
macroscopic	level,	should	alert	the	therapist	to	the
possibility	that	he	or	she	is	dealing	with	an	early
preoedipal	disorder.
It	 is	 best	 to	 use	 the	 term	 “acting	 out”	 to
represent	 the	 equivalent	 of	 a	 transference—the
patient	avoids	understanding	the	transference	by
acting	it	out	outside	the	office	or	acting	it	in	inside
the	 office.	 This	 should	 be	 distinguished	 from	 the
behavior	of	impulsive	character	disorders,	but	the
terms	 are	 frequently	 used	 in	 an	 overlapping
fashion	and	also	confused	with	labeling	what	the
therapist	considers	simply	to	be	bad	behavior	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
46
the	part	of	the	patient.
Etchegoyen	 (1991)	 emphasizes	 that,	 “Acting
out	 characteristically	 places	 the	 analyst	 in	 a
compromising	 situation,	 which	 always	 creates
strong	 countertransference	 conflicts”	 (p.	 700).	 It
should	 be	 kept	 in	 mind,	 as	 he	 emphasizes,	 that
acting	 out	 is	 often	 an	 effort	 to	 make	 the	 analyst
blunder,	to	interfere	with	his	or	her	competence,
or	to	constitute	an	attack	on	the	frame	or	setting	in
which	 the	 psychoanalytic	 process	 goes	 on.
Etchegoyen	 concludes,	 “The	 transference	 goes
towards	the	object;	the	acting	out	distances	itself
from	the	object”	(p.	701).

ACTION	THOUGHT
Kohut	 (1977)	 introduced	 the	 clinical	 concept
of	action	thought,	which	represents	steps	made	by
the	 patient	 who	 is	 healing	 a	 disorder	 of	 the	 self
along	
the	
path	
of	
achieving	
psychological
equilibrium.	 It	 consists	 of	 action	 patterns,
creatively	initiated	by	the	patient	on	the	basis	of
actual	 talents,	 ambitions,	 and	 ideals,	 but	 to	 be
further	modified	and	perfected	in	order	to	provide
a	 reliable	 means	 of	 establishing	 the	 postanalytic
maintenance	
of	
a	
stable	
psychoeconomic
equilibrium	 in	 the	 narcissistic	 sector	 of	 the
personality.	Such	activity	should	not	be	expected
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
48
to	
dissolve	
as	
a	
consequence	
of	
correct
interpretation	 and	 does	 not	 represent	 regressive
or	 defensive	 behavior,	 but	 rather	 constitutes	 a
forward	 movement.	 Lack	 of	 recognition	 of	 the
forward	 nature	 of	 this	 movement	 is	 experienced
by	the	patient	as	an	empathic	lapse.
The	 sequence	 described	 (Kohut	 1977)	 in	 the
case	of	Mr.	M.,	of	an	action	sequence	from	playing
the	 violin,	 to	 befriending	 an	 adolescent	 boy,	 to
opening	 a	 writing	 school,	 is	 an	 excellent
description	
of	
action	
thought	
as	
clinically
observed.	A	similar	form	of	action	thought	has	to
take	 place	 as	 the	 patient	 gradually	 develops	 a
more	effective	empathic	matrix	of	selfobjects	that
reflects	the	patient’s	improvement	in	the	cohesion
of	the	self	and	the	internal	integration	of	archaic
narcissistic	structures.

ACTIVE	TECHNIQUE
This	 represents	 a	 notorious	 variation	 in
psychoanalytic	technique	introduced	by	Ferenczi,
in	which	the	analyst	no	longer	concentrates	on	an
expectant	 attitude	 characterized	 by	 free-floating
attention	 and	 in	 preparation	 for	 interpretations,
but	rather	formulates	injunctions	and	prohibitions
with	 regard	 to	 certain	 behavior	 by	 the	 patient.
This	 behavior	 may	 refer	 to	 what	 is	 happening
within	 the	 treatment	 or	 outside	 of	 it	 if	 such
behavior	 is	 procuring	 satisfaction.	 The	 active
technique	also	includes	placing	a	time	limit	on	the
treatment	in	certain	cases.
The	definitive	statement	of	this	technique	was
presented	in	a	monograph	by	Ferenczi	and	Rank
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
50
(1986),	which	first	appeared	in	1924,	and	brought
down	 considerable	 vilification	 on	 both	 authors.
Their	suggestions	included	taking	on	certain	roles
with	 patients	 and	 attempting	 to	 convert	 the
analysis	 into	 a	 new	 affective	 experience	 for	 the
patient.	At	one	point	Ferenczi	experimented	with
actually	 kissing	 and	 holding	 patients,	 but	 he
abandoned	
such	
extreme	
measures	
and
recognized	 that	 they	 were	 counterproductive
(see	FERENCZI).
Unfortunately,	 Ferenczi	 has	 been	 condemned
for	 his	 experimentation	 without	 recognition	 that
he	 was	 responding	 to	 Freud’s	 insistence	 on	 the
specificity	of	interpretation	as	the	curative	factor
in	 psychoanalysis;	 these	 days	 we	 would	 be
inclined	 to	 agree	 with	 Ferenczi	 that	 there	 is	 an
emotional	experience	that	takes	place	between	the
patient	 and	 the	 doctor	 which	 has	 an	 important
effect	on	the	treatment.	The	extent	and	centrality
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
51
of	 this	 effect	 remains	 a	 matter	 of	 considerable
debate	(Chessick	in	press).
Ferenczi	 and	 Rank	 (1986)	 downplay	 the
intellectual	
aspects	
of	
explanation	
and
interpretation	 in	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 and
stress	 the	 importance	 of	 repeating	 crucial
relationships	in	the	treatment	under	the	influence
of	 the	 repetition	 compulsion.	 At	 times	 they
advocate	 an	 “active”	 form	 of	 intervention	 on	 the
part	of	the	analyst,	even	hypnosis	or	suggestion,	in
the	 service,	 as	 they	 see	 it,	 of	 facilitating	 this
repetition.	This	“active	therapy”	for	the	ostensive
purpose	of	facilitating	feelings	and	emotions	in	the
treatment	 was	 correctly	 perceived	 by	 their
contemporaries	 as	 a	 major	 divergence	 from
standard	 psychoanalytic	 technique,	 fraught	 with
problems	of	countertransference	acting	out.
There	 are	 some	 fascinating	 comments	 about
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
52
narcissistic	countertransference	contained	in	their
monograph.	 For	 example,	 they	 warn	 of	 the
“development	
of	
a	
kind	
of	
narcissistic
countertransference	 which	 provokes	 the	 person
being	 analyzed	 into	 pushing	 into	 the	 foreground
certain	things	which	flatter	the	analyst	and,	on	the
other	 hand,	 into	 suppressing	 remarks	 and
associations	of	an	unpleasant	nature	in	relation	to
him”	 (pp.	 41-42).	 The	 authors	 even	 stress	 that
failures	 in	 analysis	 can	 be	 attributed	 to	 the
narcissism	of	the	patient	as	a	consolation	for	the
analyst,	since	“it	is	not	difficult	to	find	proofs	in	his
behavior	 and	 thoughts	 for	 the	 narcissism	 of	 the
patient”	(p.	42).

ACTUAL	NEUROSIS
This	term	is	included	because	it	is	still	found
occasionally	 in	 the	 literature,	 although	 nobody
currently	 pays	 much	 attention	 to	 the	 concept.	 It
was	used	by	Freud	to	denote	disorders	that	were
neurotic	 but	 not	 psychoneuroses.	 The	 cause	 of
actual	neuroses	was	thought	due	to	an	unhealthy
sex	life	the	patient	was	actually	leading	at	the	time
he	or	she	appeared	in	the	clinical	consulting	room
(the	 German	 word	 aktual	 means	 “present-day”).
This	
is	
contrasted	
by	
Freud	
with	
the
psychoneuroses,	
which	
have	
their	
etiologic
nucleus	 in	 the	 unresolved	 childhood	 Oedipus
complex.	 The	 basis	 of	 the	 actual	 neuroses	 was
thought	by	Freud	to	be	somatic,	a	damming	up	of
sexual	toxins	that	led	to	the	symptoms	the	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
54
complained	 of,	 such	 as	 neurasthenia	 with	 its
classical	 signs	 of	 fatigue,	 headache,	 various
gastrointestinal	disturbances,	paresthesias,	and	so
forth.
Freud	did	not	believe	the	actual	neuroses	were
amenable	to	psychoanalytic	treatment.	He	(1895)
divided	 the	 actual	 neuroses	 into	 “neurasthenia
proper,”	 which	 he	 believed	 due	 to	 inadequate	 or
“abnormal	 discharge	 of	 sexual	 excitation”	 as	 in
masturbation,	 and	 “anxiety	 neurosis,”	 which	 he
thought	 due	 to	 the	 blockage	 of	 sexual	 discharge
and	 the	 deflection	 of	 sexual	 toxins	 into	 morbid
anxiety,	as	in	the	practices	of	abstinence	or	coitus
interruptus.

ADAPTATION
Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 adaptation	 as
the	 act	 of	 fitting	 one	 thing	 to	 another,	 or	 “the
fitness	 of	 one	 thing	 to	 another”	 (p.	 27).	 This
apparently	simple	term	is	much	more	tricky	than
it	appears	and	has	led	to	considerable	controversy.
The	implication	is	that	fitting	or	conforming	to	the
environment	
is	
an	
advantageous	
change;
furthermore,	 that	 the	 end	 result	 of	 successful
adaptation	
is	
normal	
adjustment,	
whereas
maladjustment	represents	a	failure	in	adaptation.
This	was	a	central	tenet	of	the	work	of	Hartmann
(1958),	which	initiated	the	so-called	United	States
school	of	ego	psychology.	Hartmann,	by	stressing
the	 importance	 of	 adaptation	 as	 a	 goal	 of	 ego
functioning,	attempted	to	create	the	foundation	of
a	general	psychoanalytic	psychology	of	the	normal
as	 well	 as	 the	 abnormal	 individual,	 and	 moved
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
56
psychoanalytic	theory	a	step	closer	to	emphasizing
primary	object	relations	and	becoming	more	of	a
two-person	theory	(Greenberg	and	Mitchell	1983).
The	 whole	 concept	 came	 under	 considerable
attack	 from	 Lacanians	 and	 other	 continental
psychoanalysts,	who	argued	that	this	was	a	United
States	travesty	of	psychoanalysis,	in	which	fitting
into	the	culture	was	given	too	much	emphasis	and
the	uncovering	of	repressed	unconscious	conflicts
was	deemphasized.	It	also	became	a	rallying	point
for	Marxists,	who	opposed	U.S.	ego	psychology	and
challenged	whether	adaptation	to	a	“sick”	culture
or	a	repressive	society	could	be	taken	as	a	mark	of
mental	health.	There	has	been	a	gradual	reduction
of	emphasis	on	the	importance	of	adaptation	as	a
goal	in	psychoanalytic	therapy.

ADHESIVENESS	OF	THE	LIBIDO
This	 concept	 was	 introduced	 by	 Freud	 to
account	 for	 failures	 in	 psychoanalysis	 in	 which
there	 was	 such	 a	 strong	 binding	 of	 libido	 to
various	 complexes	 or	 infantile	 objects	 that
enormous	or	heroic	effort	was	needed	to	remove
such	a	tangle	if	it	could	be	removed	at	all.	It	was

cause	 of	 interminable	 analysis,	 and	 it	 has	 the
unfortunate	history	of	being	used	as	an	excuse	for
failure	of	treatment.	Adhesiveness	is	thought	of	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
58
a	certain	psychical	inertia	and	implies	the	flow	of
libido	
as	
a	
liquid.	
Indeed,	
Freud’s	
entire
metapsychological	system	has	been	characterized
as	 a	 hydrodynamic	 model	 (Peterfreund	 and
Schwartz,	 1971),	 which	 is	 a	 correct	 depiction.	 If

AFFECT
There	 is	 considerable	 controversy	 about	 the
precise	 metapsychological	 meaning	 of	 “affect,”	 a
general	 term	 for	 feelings	 and	 emotions;	 Samuel
Johnson	 defines	 affect	 as	 passion.	 It	 is	 not
necessary	to	think	of	affect	as	quite	that	powerful,
so	 any	 feelings	 accompanying	 an	 idea	 or	 mental
representation	 are	 properly	 characterized	 as
affects.	 What	 is	 also	 important,	 of	 course,	 is	 the
clinical	 situation	 where	 no	 affect	 appears,	 a
situation	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 “flatness”	 of
affect.	This	may	be	characteristic	of	schizophrenia,
as	Bleuler	(1911)	thought,	or	it	may	occur	in	such
conditions	 as	 depression	 and	 the	 obsessional
neuroses.	 In	 the	 latter,	 affect	 is	 separated	 from
ideation	 and	 only	 the	 ideation	 appears	 in	 the
content	 of	 consciousness.	 In	 certain	 borderline
patients	the	opposite	may	be	true.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
60
The	
debate	
over	
the	
metapsychological
meaning	 of	 affect	 continues	 even	 today	 (Lester
1980),	for	example	in	the	argument	as	to	whether
there	is	such	a	thing	as	unconscious	affect.	Freud’s
original	idea	was	that	the	nuances	of	affect	were
added	 by	 the	 preconscious	 when	 unconscious
ideation	 rose	 into	 the	 conscious	 mind,	 and	 that
seems	 to	 be	 a	 satisfactory	 clinical	 working
definition.

AFTER-EDUCATION
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
61
Freud	 (1940)	 described	 psychoanalysis	 as	 a
form	 of	 after-education.	 This	 is	 a	 concept	 which
seems	 to	 run	 contrary	 to	 Freud’s	 usual,	 more
formal	insistence	that	interpretation	is	the	central
curative	 factor	 in	 psychoanalytic	 therapy.	 It
remains	 controversial	 today	 to	 what	 extent
interpretation	 is	 curative	 and	 to	 what	 extent	 the
after-educational	
or	
corrective	
emotional
experience	 process	 is	 primary	 as	 curative	 in
psychotherapy.	The	traditional	theoretical	idea	is
that	 the	 more	 a	 psychoanalysis	 approaches	 the
pure	 ideal,	 the	 more	 interpretation	 becomes
central.	 In	 forms	 of	 supportive	 psychotherapy,
after-education	is	central.
The	 psychotherapist	 should	 never	 forget	 that
no	 matter	 how	 hard	 he	 or	 she	 attempts	 to	 not
influence	
the	
patient,	
there	
is	
always	
a
tremendous	 after-education	 that	 goes	 on	 in	 any
intensive	 psychotherapy	 or	 even	 psychoanalysis.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
62
The	clinical	situation	calls	forth	a	transference	that
renders	 the	 patient	 quite	 suggestible;	 it	 is	 this
suggestibility	that	makes	it	so	difficult	to	evaluate
the	 data	 of	 any	 psychoanalytic	 treatment.	 So
Jungians	 hear	 Jungian	 material,	 Adlerians	 hear
Adlerian	 material,	 Freudians	 hear	 evidence	 for
Freud’s	 theories,	 Kohutians	 hear	 about	 the	 self,
and	so	on.	The	effect	of	all	this	should	be	to	make
us	more	humble	and	less	inclined	to	criticize	our
colleagues	 when	 they	 have	 theoretical	 positions
that	are	different	from	our	own.

AGENT
Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 the	 agent	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
63
“he	 that	 possesses	 the	 faculty	 of	 action”	 (p.	 47).
Freud	often	used	the	term	“agency”	or	“system”	to
designate	 the	 substructures	 of	 his	 psychical
apparatus.	It	is	important	to	keep	in	mind	that	the
ego	and	the	superego	are	to	be	regarded	as	agents
rather	 than	 material	 parts	 of	 a	 machine.	 They
represent	a	series	of	functions	or	psychic	activities
and	 not	 little	 men	 operating	 levers	 and	 pulleys
inside	the	head,	as	they	are	so	often	misleadingly
employed	in	the	literature.
Furthermore,	the	agency	“ego”	is	the	sum	total
of	 its	 various	 functions	 and	 in	 this	 manner	 is
different	 from	 the	 sense	 of	 self.	 Confusion
occurred	
because	
Freud	
never	
made	
this
differentiation,	referring	to	“ego”	and	“self’	by	the
same	term	(see	EGO).

AGGRESSIVE	DRIVE
Every	
practicing	
clinician	
encounters
enormous	 amounts	 of	 aggression	 pouring	 out	 of
their	 patients	 in	 various	 forms,	 either	 active	 or
passive,	direct	or	indirect,	displaced	or	disguised.
The	question	of	the	origin	of	all	this	aggression	is
one	 of	 the	 most	 hotly	 debated	 issues	 in	 the
literature	today.	Whether	there	is	such	a	thing	as
an	aggressive	drive	in	contrast	to	the	sexual	drive,
a	 duality	 that	 more	 or	 less	 satisfied	 U.S.	 ego
psychologists,	 or	 whether	 the	 aggressive	 drive
represents	the	outward	manifestations	of	primary
masochism	or	the	death	instinct	as	the	Kleinians
propose,	remains	an	almost	impossible	argument
to	resolve	(Chessick	1992).	Other	authors,	such	as
Kohut	 (1977),	 maintain	 that	 aggression,	 when	 it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
65
appears,	 is	 a	 breakdown	 product	 of	 the	 sense	 of
self	and	that	there	is	no	primary	aggressive	drive
in	
the	
personality
(see	FRAGMENTATION	and	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).
Considerable	
research	
has	
managed	
to
produce	 a	 series	 of	 conflicting	 theories	 and
hypotheses	on	the	topic.	For	the	purposes	of	the
practicing	clinician,	the	main	choice	is	between	the
traditional	 psychoanalytic	 view	 that	 there	 is	 an
aggressive	 drive	 and	 the	 view	 of	 self	 psychology
that	the	appearance	of	aggression	signals	that	the
self	 is	 in	 danger	 of	 fragmentation	 or	 has
fragmented.	 This	 is	 a	 clinical	 decision	 that	 will
have	to	be	made	by	each	therapist	after	prolonged
immersion	 in	 the	 material	 and	 considerable	 self-
scrutiny.
Aggression	 also	 must	 be	 distinguished	 by
clinicians	 from	 assertiveness,	 which	 is	 a	 more
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
66
forward-moving	
and	
constructive	
form	
of
behavior.	The	goal	of	aggression	is	destruction	of
the	object	and,	as	Freud	(1930)	pointed	out,	there
is	 considerable	 narcissistic	 gratification	 in	 the
outpouring	 of	 pure	 aggression.	 Although	 it	 was
Adler	who	introduced	the	concept	of	an	aggressive
drive	in	1908,	it	is	in	the	theories	of	Melanie	Klein
that	 primary	 masochism	 and	 secondary	 sadism
reach	their	central	importance.
There	are	over	200	definitions	of	aggression	in
the	 literature.	 The	 clinician	 should	 keep	 in	 mind
that	when	we	speak	of	an	aggressive	drive	in	our
therapeutic	 work,	 we	 are	 referring	 to	 hate	 and
destruction	 and	 not	 an	 attenuated	 form	 of	 it,
which	 would	 only	 represent	 derivatives	 of	 the
aggressive	 drive.	 These	 derivatives,	 as	 they	 are
seen	 clinically,	 can	 range	 from	 withholding,
irritation,	anger,	and	resentment,	to	the	extremes
of	 tantrums,	 fury,	 and	 murderous	 rage.	 Dealing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
67
with	this	poses	one	of	the	most	difficult,	if	not	the
most	 difficult,	 tasks	 of	 intensive	 psychotherapy.
Collusion	 between	 the	 patient	 and	 therapist	 to
avoid	
these	
derivatives	
in	
the	
negative
transference	 is	 a	 frequent	 cause	 of	 the	 need	 for
reanalysis	and	of	acting	out.

AIM	INHIBITION
Freud	 (1915)	 said	 that	 every	 instinct	 has	 a
source,	aim,	and	object.	When	the	aim	of	the	drive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
68
is	inhibited,	we	say	that	a	partial	manifestation	of
the	 drive	 shows	 itself	 in	 our	 clinical	 work.	 A
typical	 example	 of	 this	 is	 represented	 by
friendships,	or	so-called	platonic	love,	or	domestic
affection	between	relatives.	If	the	aim	of	the	drive
was	not	inhibited	in	these	situations,	friendships
would	 be	 overtly	 sexual,	 platonic	 love	 would	 be
consummated,	and	incest	would	be	ubiquitous.
The	aim	of	an	instinct	is	the	activity	by	which
the	 drive	 or	 impulse	 achieves	 gratification	 or
discharge.	 A	 maximum	 of	 pleasure	 takes	 place
when	 there	 is	 discharge,	 in	 a	 fully	 uninhibited,
sudden	 fashion,	 of	 a	 dammed	 up	 powerful
instinctual	drive.	So	the	program	of	human	life	is
the	program	of	the	pleasure	principle,	according	to
Freud.
When	aim	inhibition	occurs,	a	qualification	of
the	 discharge	 and	 a	 diminution	 of	 the	 pleasure
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
69
involved	 must	 take	 place.	 We	 find	 this	 to	 occur
frequently	 in	 clinical	 situations	 where	 patients,
first	tentatively	and	sometimes	timidly,	aim	their
instinctual	 drives	 at	 us	 in	 seeking	 gratification.
Only	 with	 the	 help	 of	 interpretation	 can	 the	 full
power	 of	 these	 drives	 be	 released	 in	 the
transference	 situation.	 The	 converse	 is	 also	 true:
when	 a	 patient	 very	 early	 in	 treatment	 releases
the	 full	 power	 of	 these	 drives	 in	 a	 transference
situation	to	the	therapist,	we	are	almost	invariably
dealing	with	a	disabled	or	defective	ego	that	is	not
functioning	 properly.	 The	 exception	 to	 this	 is	 a
patient	 who	 has	 already	 had	 one	 or	 two
psychoanalyses	and	is	now	in	a	reanalysis;	in	such
a	patient,	the	capacity	for	regression	in	the	service
of	the	ego	sometimes	has	been	highly	developed.
For	 the	 most	 part,	 however,	 clinicians	 should
be	extremely	wary	of	patients	who	begin	therapy
with	 massive	 discharges	 of	 affect	 and	 powerful
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
70
attempts	 to	 utilize	 the	 therapist	 as	 a	 source	 of
gratification.	These	are	very	difficult	and	disturbed
patients.	 Their	 transferences	 are	 often	 labeled
“archaic”	
and	
give	
rise	
to	
serious
countertransference	problems.
There	 could	 be	 no	 culture	 and	 no	 civilization
and	no	orderly	process	of	psychotherapy	if	there
were	 no	 substantial	 aim	 inhibition	 of	 the	 drives
going	 on	 all	 the	 time.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 reasons
addicted	 patients	 claim	 that	 nothing	 gives	 them
the	 same	 satisfaction	 as	 the	 powerful	 “high”	 of
their	addictive	substances,	and	in	this	sense	they
are	 correct.	 We	 must	 remember	 that,	 in	 asking
addicted	patients	to	give	up	their	addiction,	we	are
asking	 them	 to	 live	 a	 life	 that	 is	 not	 nearly	 as
immediately	pleasurable	as	the	one	they	had,	but
which,	of	course,	is	not	nearly	as	self-destructive.

ALEXITHYMIA
This	term,	like	the	phrase	“adhesiveness	of	the
libido”	 (see	 ADHESIVENESS	 OF	 THE	 LIBIDO)
carries	the	danger	of	being	used	as	an	excuse	for
the	 failure	 of	 a	 psychotherapy.	 Krystal	 (1982)
introduced	 it	 to	 characterize	 those	 patients	 who
are	 unable	 to	 articulate	 their	 emotions	 or	 to
distinguish	among	them.	It	was	originally	outlined
in	 a	 paper	 by	 Sifneos	 (1975),	 but	 Krystal	 has
utilized	 it	 in	 explaining	 the	 difficulty	 in	 the
psychotherapy	 of	 addictive	 or	 psychosomatic
patients.
There	 definitely	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 subgroup	 of
patients	 who	 have	 difficulty	 in	 articulating	 their
affects.	 This	 appears	 to	 be	 part	 of	 some	 sort	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
72
mentation	disturbance	in	which	their	mind	works
primarily	 without	 conscious	 fantasies,	 and	 with
thoughts	concentrated	on	daily	external	events	or
pragmatic	operative	maneuvers	involving	actions
and	 reactions	 of	 ordinary	 trivial	 life.	 All	 this	 is
recited	in	monotonous	detail	by	the	patient,	and	it
seems	 somewhat	 akin	 to	 the	 vague	 concept	 of	 a
lack	of	psychological-mindedness.
Whether	 it	 actually	 represents	 a	 genetic
problem	 to	 be	 found	 in	 the	 addictions	 and
psychosomatic	 disorders,	 or	 an	 ego	 defect,	 or	 a
compromise	 formation	 formed	 in	 the	 preoedipal
period	is	the	issue	that	remains	unresolved.	Those
psychiatrists	who	tend	to	be	biologically	oriented,
of	course,	see	it	as	an	actual	neurological	problem,
whereas	 those	 who	 are	 more	 psychoanalytically
oriented	 regard	 it	 as	 either	 a	 developmental	 ego
defect	 or	 a	 compromise	 formation	 with	 a	 better
prognosis.	 In	 my	 clinical	 experience,	 the	 latter
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
73
point	of	view	is	usually	correct.

ALLON,	THE	
(STRAUS)
(see	also	PHANTOM	LIMB)
All	 of	 the	 revisions	 of	 psychoanalytic	 theory
since	 the	 time	 of	 Freud	 have	 attempted	 to
overcome	 the	 problem	 of	 psychoanalysis	 as	 a
solipsistic	 doctrine.	 Freud	 attempted	 to	 build	 a
two-person	 psychology	 out	 of	 a	 solipsistic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
74
metapsychology.	 Erwin	 Straus	 (1891-1975),	 the
pioneer	
German	
phenomenologist-psychiatrist
(see	 PHENOMENOLOGY),	 was	 one	 of	 the	 first	 to
recognize	 this.	 He	 (1966)	 insists,	 “Significant
phenomena	
of	
psychic	
life	
must	
remain
inaccessible	to	psychological	understanding	when
psychologists	define	their	sphere	of	investigation
too	
narrowly—with	
regard	
to	
purposive,
calculated	activity	and	scientific	knowledge	only”
(p.	5).	He	(1958)	emphasizes	the	basic	“axioms	of
everyday	life”	(p.	146),	in	which	we	experience	the
Other	 in	 a	 multimodal	 fashion,	 a	 common
“something,”	 as	 Aristotle	 put	 it,	 using	 all	 the
senses.
Straus	insists	there	cannot	be	a	separation	of
the	 I	 from	 the	 Other	 as	 assumed	 in	 traditional
Cartesian	epistemology,	and	he	(1958)	claims	that
a	 “reaching-out	 beyond	 oneself,	 thus	 attaining	 to
the	 Other—which	 reveals	 itself	 thereby	 as	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
75
Other—is	 the	 basic	 phenomenon	 of	 sensory
experience,	 a	 relationship	 which	 cannot	 be
reduced	 to	 anything	 in	 the	 physical	 world”	 (p.
147).	 Like	 Husserl	 (1970),	 he	 warns	 us	 of	 the
mathematization	 of	 nature	 in	 the	 sciences	 and
attempts	 to	 lead	 us	 back	 to	 lived	 experience,
especially	 in	 a	 phenomenological	 analysis	 of	 our
relationship	 to	 the	 Other.	 The	 epistemology	 of
Freud’s	 psychoanalysis,	 the	 “narrow”	 natural
sciences	 epistemology,	 causes	 much	 to	 be	 lost,
according	to	Straus	(1958):	“Lost	is	the	possibility
of	 grasping	 the	 phenomena,	 so	 essential	 in	 one’s
relation	 to	 the	 Other,	 of	 contact,	 distance,
direction,	freedom,	and	constraint”	(p.	148).
Straus	 offers	 an	 interesting	 application	 of	 his
concept	 of	 our	 relationship	 to	 the	 Other	 and	 of
“deformation”	
in	
his	
brief	
discussion	
of
schizophrenia,	 which	 he	 views	 as	 resting	 on	 a
fundamental	 alteration	 of	 one’s	 relation	 to	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
76
Other.	For	Straus,	“Hallucinations	originate	in	the
medium	 of	 distorted	 modalities.	 They	 appear	 at
points	
where	
the	
I-world	
relations	
are
pathologically	transformed”	(p.	162),	although	the
causes	of	pathological	alterations	can	be	many	and
diverse.	 Straus’s	 concentration	 on	 the	 I-Other
relationship	
that	
the	
patient’s	
conscious
phenomena	represent	characterizes	his	approach
and	
distinguishes	
it	
from	
traditional
psychoanalysis.	 In	 his	 study	 of	 hallucinations	 he
turned	
to	
the	
phenomenology	
of	
sensory
experience,	 which	 had	 been	 largely	 ignored	 in
work	 with	 schizophrenic	 patients.	 He	 (1966)
called	this	“aesthesiology,”	attempting	to	reinstate
the	forgotten	meaning	of	“aisthesis”	(p.	259).	The
objective	 of	 Straus’s	 (Straus	 and	 Griffith	 1970)
aesthesiology	 is	 to	 present	 sensory	 experience
freed	from	traditional	prejudices,	and	I	believe	his
success	in	doing	so	accounts	for	the	freshness	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
77
impact	 of	 his	 clinical	 demonstrations	 (which	 I
personally	experienced).
A	 more	 formal	 way	 to	 conceive	 this	 is	 in
Straus’s	
(1966)	
complaint	
that	
“the
misapprehensions	 of	 objectivistic	 psychology
originate	principally	in	its	efforts	to	comprehend
the	 organism	 moving	 itself	 as	 if	 it	 were	 a	 body
moved.	 Thus,	 it	 encounters	 the	 other	 one	 as	 an
object"	 (p.	 57).	 But,	 “we	 live	 in	 the	 present;	 we
comprehend	in	the	perfect”	(p.	57).	That	is	to	say,
for	Straus	the	present	is	something	that	“becomes”
in	 time,	 and	 accounting	 for	 sensing	 and	 lived
movement	rests	on	maintaining	the	crucial	contact
with	the	primary	situation	of	“the	spatiotemporal
unity	that	characterizes	our	immediate	and	lived
rapport	with	the	world”	(p.	58).
Straus’s	
(1966)	
well-known	
paper	
“The
Upright	 Posture,”	 originally	 published	 in	 1952,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
78
concludes,	contra	Freud,	that	there	is	no	basis	to
claim	priority	for	the	drives	and	that	the	“rational”
is	 as	 genuine	 a	 part	 of	 human	 nature	 as	 the
“animal.”	 Modern	 U.S.	 psychoanalytic	 theory	 has
moved	away	from	emphasis	on	drives,	but	there	is
no	agreement	on	what	has	priority	in	humans,	or
why.	 Straus	 (1966)	 claims	 in	 this	 paper	 that,
contrary	 to	 Freud’s	 metapsychology,	 he	 makes
clinical	experience	his	point	of	departure	and	does
not	regard	the	typical	patient	“as	an	apparatus	but
as	an	experiencing	creature”	(p.	256).	Consistent
with	 that	 approach,	 Straus	 (1965)	 elsewhere
presents	some	experimental	material	from	which
he	concludes	that	the	distance	between	seeing	and
thinking	 cannot	 be	 reduced	 to	 the	 difference	 of
certain	cerebral	functions:	“In	sensory	experience
we	 are	 in	 direct	 contact	 with	 things;	 they	 stand
before	 us	 and	 we	 before	 them.	 In	 thinking	 the
relation	 is	 an	 indirect	 one;	 the	 noema	 mediates
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
79
between	 the	 thinker	 and	 the	 target	 of	 his
imagination”	(pp.	282-283).	This	viewpoint	mixes
together	 several	 philosophical	 positions	 and
explains	 why	 Straus	 is	 so	 hard	 to	 classify
(Spiegelberg,	1972).
In	 an	 essay	 on	 psychiatry	 and	 philosophy
Straus	(Straus	et	al.	1969)	summarizes	his	views
in	this	way:	“The	object	of	psychiatric	action	is	not
primarily	the	brain,	the	body,	or	the	organism;	it
should	 be	 integral	 man	 in	 the	 uniqueness	 of	 his
individual	 existence	 as	 this	 discloses	 itself—
independently	of	the	distinction	between	healthy
and	 sick—in	 existential	 communication”	 (p.	 2).
This	difficult	essay,	first	published	in	1963,	deals
with	 the	 fact	 that	 I	 and	 another	 person	 do	 not
encounter	each	other	in	a	void.	We	do	not	confront
one	another	immediately	as	ego	and	another	ego.
So	a	discussion	of	my	relation	to	the	Other,	which
mediates	 between	 us,	 must	 accompany	 if	 not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
80
precede	 a	 discussion	 of	 our	 communicative
relationship.
Straus	uses	the	term	“the	Allon”	to	distinguish
the	fact	that	when	he	speaks	of	the	Other	he	is	not
denoting	 a	 particular	 isolated	 human	 or	 a
particular	 thing	 separate	 from	 the	 experiencing
subject.	 The	 Allon	 represents	 the	 relationship	 of
the	individual	to	the	whole	of	which	he	or	she	is	a
part,	so	the	Allon	is	present	even	for	someone	who
is	alone.	In	applying	this,	for	example,	to	a	study	of
visual	
perception,	
the	
Allon	
encompasses
whatever	 the	 situation	 might	 be	 that	 the
individual	 finds	 himself	 or	 herself	 in	 visually.
Straus	
writes,	
“The	
meaning	
of	
’mine’	
is
determined	in	relation	to,	in	contraposition	to,	the
world,	 the	 Allon,	 to	 which	 I	 am	 nevertheless	 a
party.	
The	
meaning	
of	
‘mine’	
is	
not
comprehensible	in	the	unmediated	antithesis	of	I
and	 not-I,	 own	 and	 strange,	 subject	 and	 object,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
81
constituting	 I	 and	 constituted	 world.	 Everything
points	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 separateness	 and	 union
originate	in	the	same	ground”	(p.	29).
It	 is	 very	 significant	 in	 the	 practice	 of
psychotherapy	 that,	 as	 Straus	 points	 out,	 “our
relation	 to	 the	 Allon	 is	 a	 dialectical	 one,	 a
contraposition	 or	 connection	 in	 separation.	 The
visible	does	not	belong	to	an	external	world	from
which	we	are	separated	by	an	impassable	gulf’	(p.
33).	So	Straus	would	say	that	the	natural	sciences
epistemology	
used	
in	
psychiatry	
and
psychoanalysis	 has	 replaced	 the	 axioms	 of
everyday	 life	 by	 abstract	 constructs,	 yet	 it	 is	 the
naive	realism	of	everyday	life	through	which	the
living	reach	an	understanding	among	themselves
and	an	understanding	of	the	evidences	of	the	past.
The	 concept	 of	 the	 Allon	 becomes	 rather
mysterious,	since,	as	Straus	conceives	of	it,	“in	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
82
dialectic	 of	 accessibility	 and	 remoteness,	 of
hiddenness	 and	 openness,	 the	 Allon	 remains
enigmatic”	 (p.	 46).	 Here,	 one	 is	 reminded	 of
Heidegger’s	
concept	
of	
the	
simultaneous
concealing	and	revealing	of	Being,	which	is	what	I
think	 Straus	 had	 in	 mind.	 More	 evidence	 for
Heidegger’s	
influence	
appears	
when	
Straus
remarks,	 “In	 our	 relationship	 to	 the	 Allon	 the
whole	 reveals	 itself	 only	 in	 fragments.	 The
fragments,	 comprehended	 as	 such,	 refer	 beyond
themselves	 to	 still	 other	 fragments	 and	 to	 the
constantly	 present	 background	 of	 the	 as	 yet
indeterminate	 whole.	 We	 always	 find	 ourselves
encircled	 by	 a	 spatial	 and	 a	 temporal	 horizon,
which,	 however	 open,	 remains	 a	 boundary	 that
excludes	 what	 lies	 beyond	 it”	 (p.	 49).	 I	 think
Straus’s	 concept	 of	 the	 I-Other	 or	 the	 I-Allon
relationship	is	precisely	what	has	been	left	out	in
the	training	of	psychiatrists	and	psychoanalysts	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
83
the	past,	and	does	not	receive	the	recognition	that
it	deserves.	His	ten	theses	(Straus	1966,	pp.	268-
274)	on	the	Allon	well	repay	their	careful	study	by
clinicians.
Straus	 (1958)	 explains	 that	 “the	 actual
moment,	 the	 changing	 Now	 of	 my	 becoming,	 is
determined	with	reference	to	the	Other,	by	which	I
am	 affected”	 (p.	 152).	 This	 Other,	 which	 Straus
sometimes	 uses	 synonymously	 with	 “the	 world,”
although	 it	 is	 a	 unit,	 shows	 itself	 composed	 of	 a
manyness	 of	 things	 and	 divided	 into	 a	 variety	 of
aspects.	 This	 idea	 becomes	 even	 more	 complex
when	 we	 speak	 of	 the	 relationship	 of	 two
individuals	 to	 each	 other.	 As	 Straus	 teaches,	 we
cannot	 understand	 that	 relationship	 without
reference	to	a	“Third,”	which	represents	the	Other,
or	Allon;	it	is	this	Allon	that	is	the	milieu	in	which
we	 are	 immersed	 inextricably,	 thrown	 into	 it,	 to
use	 the	 language	 of	 Heidegger.	 So	 we	 can	 never
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
84
totally	 perceive	 the	 Other,	 and	 only	 with	 various
senses	 can	 we	 perceive	 variegated	 aspects	 or
perspectives	 on	 it.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 we	 are
immersed	 in	 it,	 which	 explains	 the	 curious
simultaneous	separateness	and	attachment	in	our
relationship	to	the	Other.
It	
is	
phenomenological	
analysis
(see	
PHENOMENOLOGY)	
that	
reveals	
“the
manyness	of	modalities”	(Straus	1958,	p.	155)	in
which	the	Other	is	shown	in	shifting	aspects	and
perspectives,	and	it	is	such	analysis	that	effectively
demonstrates	the	reductiveness	of	the	traditional
epistemology	 of	 psychoanalysis.	 This	 is	 true
whether	we	use	Freud’s	drive	theory	or	whether
we	 use	 object	 relations	 theory,	 since	 the	 latter
reduces	the	internalizations	of	the	parent	figures
as	object	representations	without	reference	to	the
Allon,	in	which	both	the	baby	and	the	parent	are
immersed	 and	 separated	 simultaneously.	 When
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
85
the	 relationship	 to	 the	 Other	 is	 distorted	 in	 one
modality	
or	
another,	
what	
appears
phenomenologically	 as	 hallucinations	 are	 simply
the	 patient’s	 descriptions	 of	 these	 distortions.
Straus	(1958)	explains	that	an	early	pathological
disturbance	 of	 one’s	 relation	 to	 the	 Other,	 “so
alters	 direction,	 distance,	 and	 boundary,	 that	 the
Other	appears	as	it	were,	in	new	aspects”	(p.	162).
In	 his	 most	 sophisticated	 study	 of	 the	 Other,
Straus	 seeks	 to	 demonstrate	 our	 relationship	 to
the	
Allon	
primarily	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
his
phenomenological	analysis	of	visual	sensation	and
human	locomotion	and	motility.

ALLOPLASTIC
The	
terms	
“alloplastic”	
and	
“autoplastic
adaptation,”	 introduced	 by	 Alexander	 (1930),
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
87
refer	 to	 a	 patient’s	 lifestyle.	 A	 patient	 who	 uses
predominantly	 autoplastic	 adaptation	 employs
intrapsychic	mechanisms	of	defense,	such	as	those
that	 typically	 appear	 in	 the	 psychoneuroses,
whereas	 a	 patient	 who	 uses	 alloplastic	 forms	 of
adaptation	 tends	 to	 act	 out	 and	 repeat	 conflicts
with	 others	 in	 the	 environment.	 Patients	 can	 be
arranged	 according	 to	 their	 forms	 of	 adaptation,
with	those	who	are	mostly	alloplastic	at	one	end	of
the	 spectrum	 and	 those	 who	 are	 mostly
autoplastic	 at	 the	 other.	 These	 descriptive	 terms
can	 be	 used	 to	 trace	 early	 characterological
compromise	 formations,	 but	 there	 are	 also
possibly	constitutional	factors	involved.

ALPHA-FUNCTION
This	 concept	 constitutes	 part	 of	 a	 rather
obscure	and	fanciful	but	fascinating	epistemology
invented	 by	 the	 Kleinian	 psychoanalyst	 Wilfred
Bion	(1967).	In	the	infant,	experience	is	generated
from	 raw	 sense	 data	 by	 meeting	 with	 some
preexisting	
expectations.	
Together	
these
constitute	 a	 meaningful	 conception.	 The	 alpha-
function	is	the	conversion	of	this	raw	sense	data	as
it	combines	with	the	preexisting	expectations	into
meaningful	 integrated	 experiences.	 On	 some
occasions,	however,	there	is	a	failure	of	the	alpha-
function,	 with	 the	 result	 that	 particles	 of
“undigested”	 sense	 data	 accumulate.	 These	 are
beta	elements	(Hinshelwood	1989).	So	the	alpha-
function	represents	the	process	involved	in	taking
raw	 sense	 data	 and	 generating	 out	 of	 it	 mental
contents	 that	 have	 meaning	 and	 can	 be	 used	 for
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
89
thinking.	 These	 resulting	 products	 of	 alpha-
function	are	what	Bion	calls	alpha	elements.	The
failure	of	alpha-function	causes	an	accumulation	of
beta	elements,	which	are	then,	according	to	Bion,
expelled	by	the	process	of	projective	identification
(see	PROJECTIVE	IDENTIFICATION).
From	 my	 point	 of	 view,	 what	 is	 important	 in
this	for	psychotherapists	is	Bion’s	concept	that	the
mother’s	 alpha-function	 has	 to	 assimilate	 these
projected	 beta	 elements	 and	 convert	 them	 into
alpha	elements,	which	the	baby	can	then	take	back
by	
the	
process	
of	
introjection	
(see
INTROJECTION).	This	has	significant	ramifications
for	 psychotherapy.	 The	 patient	 projects	 raw,
unintegrated	 beta	 elements	 onto	 the	 therapist,
whose	calm,	neutral,	anxiety-free	attitude	enables
him	or	her	to	assimilate,	understand,	and	interpret
this	material.	The	patient	is	then	able	to	introject
the	 assimilated	 material	 in	 a	 “digested”	 form,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
90
which	contributes	to	his	or	her	development	and
ego	integration.	Another	name	for	this	is	the	“toilet
function”	 of	 the	 analyst,	 which,	 using	 Kleinian
terminology,	 is	 an	 important	 factor	 in	 healing
through	psychotherapy	(see	REVERIE).
Readers	tend	to	be	put	off	by	the	metaphorical
or	obscure	language	of	Bion	and	many	of	the	neo-
Kleinians.	 However,	 there	 are	 some	 concepts
buried	 in	 this	 obscurity	 that	 are	 very	 important
and	bring	us	to	the	cutting	edge	of	the	nonverbal
interaction	 and	 communication	 that	 goes	 on	 in
intensive	psychotherapy.

ALTRUISM
The	French	philosopher	Auguste	Comte	(1798-
1857)	coined	the	term	“altruism”	as	representing
living	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 others.	 There	 is	 clearly	 a
moral	 judgment	 involved	 in	 the	 use	 of	 the	 term,
since	 altruistic	 individuals	 are	 considered	 to	 be
ethically	 superior	 to	 those	 who	 are	 narcissistic.
Freud	 did	 not	 believe	 there	 was	 such	 a	 thing	 as
altruism	and	argued	that	in	some	manner	all	so-
called	 altruistic	 behavior	 brings	 gratification	 of
various	 derivatives	 of	 instinctual	 drives,	 either
directly	 or	 vicariously.	 Anna	 Freud	 (1946)
identified	an	important	defense,	which	she	called
“a	 form	 of	 altruism,”	 that	 represents	 vicarious
gratification	 by	 an	 altruistic	 surrender	 to	 the
needs	of	another	individual.
The	question	of	whether	or	not	there	is	such	a
motive	or	impulse	as	genuine	altruism	ultimately
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
92
resolves	itself	into	the	question	of	the	basic	nature
of	humans	and	how	it	is	formed	(Chessick	1992).
Freud,	of	course,	conceived	of	humans	as	primarily
instinct-driven	 and	 pleasure	 seeking;	 theologians
have	attempted	to	find	a	divine	aspect	to	humans
with	a	higher	ethical	valance.	This	controversy	has
been	
one	
of	
the	
sources	
of	
repeated
condemnations	of	the	psychoanalytic	point	of	view
and	 raises	 the	 issue	 of	 the	 “politics”	 of
psychoanalysis	 (Frosh	 1987).	 It	 is	 not	 of	 great
importance	to	the	practicing	clinician,	except	that
the	 clinician	 should	 be	 warned	 not	 to	 interpret
altruistic	 behavior	 as	 primarily	 pleasure	 seeking
unless	there	is	a	very	unusual	definite	indication
to	 do	 so.	 A	 patient	 may	 experience	 such
interpretations	of	altruistic	behavior	as	wounding
and	demeaning,	which	may	lead	to	a	rupture	of	the
empathic	 bond	 between	 the	 patient	 and	 the
therapist	 with	 the	 production	 of	 rage,	 which	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
93
then	 sometimes	 mislabeled	 as	 the	 rage	 that	 was
hidden	 under	 the	 allegedly	 defensive	 altruistic
behavior.

AMBIVALENCE
Bleuler	(1911)	used	this	term	to	describe	the
coexistence	of	contradictory	emotions	toward	the
same	 object,	 most	 commonly	 the	 coexistence	 of
love	and	hate.	He	believed	that	it	was	one	of	the
fundamental	signs	of	schizophrenia,	but	actually	it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
94
is	 universal.	 In	 the	 group	 of	 schizophrenias	 ego
functioning	 is	 poor,	 so	 that	 the	 extremes	 of	 the
ambivalence	 appear	 more	 rapidly	 and	 more
clearly	 in	 the	 clinical	 material,	 whereas	 in	 the
average	individual	these	extremes	are	well	hidden
and	 often	 repressed,	 so	 only	 derivatives	 of	 them
show	in	the	conscious	mind.
In	 our	 clinical	 work	 we	 observe	 how
ambivalence	 causes	 great	 suffering	 for	 patients
with	 obsessional	 neuroses	 who	 continuously
attempt	 to	 balance	 the	 two	 sides	 of	 the
ambivalence	 that	 appear	 in	 their	 consciousness,
whereas	 in	 most	 neuroses	 one	 or	 the	 other	 of
these	sides	is	more	or	less	repressed.	Ambivalence
must	be	distinguished	in	clinical	work	from	having
a	mixture	of	feelings	toward	someone	on	the	basis
of	 a	 mixture	 of	 experiences	 with	 that	 person.
Ambivalence	
is	
not	
based	
on	
a	
realistic
assessment;	 unfortunately,	 the	 term	 has	 lost	 its
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
95
precision	 and	 is	 often	 used	 vaguely	 to	 refer	 to	 a
mixture	of	feelings	that	arise	on	a	realistic	basis.
In	 regarding	 ambivalence	 as	 one	 of	 the
fundamental	 symptoms	 of	 schizophrenia,	 Bleuler
differentiated	 among	 emotional	 ambivalence,
intellectual	 ambivalence,	 and	 ambivalence	 of	 the
will.	 Freud	 (1912)	 borrowed	 the	 term	 from
Bleuler	to	account	for	the	phenomenon	of	negative
transference	when	it	is	found	side	by	side	with	an
affectionate	
transference,	
both	
directed
simultaneously	toward	the	same	person.
This	concept	is	central	to	the	work	of	Melanie
Klein	 (see	 KLEIN),	 since	 love	 for	 the	 primary
maternal	 object	 is	 inseparable	 from	 the	 wish	 to
destroy	it	on	the	basis	of	the	dual	instinct	theory
and	leads	to	splitting	at	the	very	beginning	of	life
with	subsequent	projective	identification.	This	in
turn	 leads	 to	 the	 paranoid-schizoid	 position	 that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
96
Klein	considered	universal	in	the	first	few	months
of	life.
In	 our	 clinical	 work	 the	 importance	 of
ambivalence	when	it	appears	rests	on	how	central
it	is	to	a	patient’s	preoccupations;	a	schizophrenic
or	obsessional	patient	is	especially	prone	to	suffer
from	an	incapacity	due	to	this	ambivalence.	When
ambivalence	 appears	 in	 the	 transferences	 of	 a
psychoneurotic	 patient,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 clear
away	the	resistances	to	the	manifestations	of	these
emotions,	so	that	the	patient	may	experience	them
in	 a	 more	 fundamental	 form	 and	 deal	 with	 the
nuclear	infantile	conflicts	where	ambivalence	first
originates.

ANACLITIC
Freud	
(1914)	
distinguished	
between
narcissistic	 and	 anaclitic	 object	 choice.	 The	 term
“anaclitic”	 conies	 from	 the	 Greek	 verb	 ανακλινω
(anaklinō),	 which	 literally	 means	 “to	 lean	 one
thing	on	another.”	Narcissistic	object	choice	occurs
when	a	person	chooses	an	object	on	the	basis	of
some	 real	 or	 imagined	 similarity	 to	 himself	 or
herself,	 while	 anaclitic	 object	 choice	 is	 manifest
when	 it	 is	 based	 on	 the	 pattern	 of	 childhood
dependency.	Thus	anaclitic	object	choice	attempts
to	 bring	 back	 a	 lost	 mother	 and	 precedes
developmentally	 any	 narcissistic	 object	 choice.
The	 latter	 is	 a	 form	 of	 secondary	 narcissism	 in
which	the	person	chosen	to	love	resembles	one’s
own	 self.	 For	 example,	 in	 certain	 cases	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
98
homosexuality,	the	object	chosen	is	the	child-self,
who	 is	 then	 treated	 the	 way	 the	 homosexual
wishes	
his	
or	
her	
mother	
to	
treat	
him
(see	HOMOSEXUALITY).
To	 avoid	 confusion,	 it	 is	 important	 to
understand	that,	for	Freud,	in	early	development
omnipotent	primary	narcissism	comes	first;	then,
due	 to	 inevitable	 frustration,	 anaclitic	 object
choice	occurs,	with	the	mother	as	the	first	object.
Narcissistic	 object	 choice,	 when	 it	 appears
clinically,	
represents	
a	
form	
of	
secondary
narcissism,	 a	 regression	 in	 which,	 as	 Freud	 said,
the	person	loves	what	he	himself	is	or	was,	what
he	 would	 like	 to	 be,	 or	 someone	 thought	 of	 as	 a
part	of	himself	(see	NARCISSISM).

ANALYTIC	THERAPY
Analytic	
therapy,	
or	
psychoanalytically
informed	 psychotherapy,	 is	 based	 on	 a	 paid
professional	 relationship	 undertaken	 by	 the
patient	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 the	 relief	 of	 mental
suffering.	 The	 patient	 pays	 for	 the	 treatment	 in
good	 faith	 in	 order	 to	 assume	 (a)	 that	 the
psychotherapist	 has	 had	 a	 thorough	 training	 in
diagnostic	and	treatment	techniques,	and	(b)	that
the	psychotherapist	has	had	a	thorough	personal
psychoanalysis	that	will	maximally	ensure	against
countertransference	 acting	 out	 and	 enable	 the
psychotherapist	 to	 listen	 to	 what	 the	 patient	 is
trying	to	communicate	without	being	disturbed	by
the	 clamor	 of	 the	 therapist’s	 needs.	 Only
psychoanalytic	therapy	can	offer	this	fundamental
setting,	 in	 which	 the	 roots	 of	 the	 patient’s
pathology	 can	 then	 unfold	 for	 examination	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
100
working	
through.	
If	
symptom	
removal	
is
attempted,	primarily	under	the	influence	of	some
sort	 of	 relationship,	 this	 is	 known	 as	 supportive
psychotherapy.	 If	 the	 focus	 is	 on	 allowing	 the
transference	to	develop	and	interpreting	it	when	it
does	so,	then	the	usual	uncovering	techniques	that
define	the	psychoanalytic	approach	can	be	used.
Only	 the	 psychoanalytic	 method	 offers	 an
escape	 from	 conscious	 or	 unconscious	 collusion
with	 the	 patient	 to	 avoid	 facing	 the	 truth	 of	 the
patient.	 This	 method	 requires	 special	 techniques
and	capacities	in	the	psychotherapist	in	order	to
let	the	material	emerge	in	a	relatively	undisturbed
fashion	 and	 to	 facilitate	 the	 development	 of
transference	 manifestations.	 Once	 a	 proper
empathic	 relationship	 has	 been	 established,	 it	 is
primarily	
in	
the	
interpretation	
of	
these
transference	manifestations	that	the	patient	gains
insight	into	the	roots	of	his	or	her	mental	suffering
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
101
and	the	basic	functioning	of	his	or	her	character.
Transference	 interpretations,	 beginning	 with	 the
contributions	 from	 both	 the	 therapist	 and	 the
patient,	 eventually	 allow	 valid	 reconstructions	 of
the	 patient’s	 early	 relationships	 and	 character
formation.
The	 alteration	 of	 character	 that	 results	 from
transference	 interpretations	 and	 reconstructions
of	the	past	is	then	tested	by	the	patient,	first	on	the
therapist	and	then	on	others	in	the	outside	world.
Through	new	experiences	a	gradual	modification
and	 correction	 takes	 place	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 this
testing,	
known	
as	
“working	
through.”	
In
uncovering	 or	 analytic	 psychotherapy,	 due	 to
limitations	of	time,	we	often	deal	with	derivatives
of	the	basic	or	nuclear	transferences.	As	a	result,
we	 must	 be	 satisfied	 with	 partial	 results	 or
improvement	 in	 only	 certain	 sectors	 of	 the
patient’s	 living;	 usually	 these	 are	 the	 sectors	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
102
patient	 has	 identified	 as	 in	 need	 of	 immediate
treatment.	In	psychoanalysis,	we	hope	for	a	more
general	 and	 deeper	 change	 in	 the	 patient’s
character,	which	also	leads	to	a	greater	capacity	to
deal	 with	 unforeseen	 problems	 that	 arise	 in	 the
future	as	well	as	with	the	inevitable	new	problems
that	accompany	subsequent	stages	of	life.
Analytic	
therapy	
should	
be	
sharply
distinguished	 from	 “analytical	 psychology,”	 the
Jungian	 theoretical	 system,	 which	 minimizes	 the
influence	of	sexual	factors	in	emotional	disorders
and	stresses	mystical	or	quasi-religious	influences.
ANXIETY
Samuel	Johnson	(1773)	defines	anxiety	as	the
trouble	of	the	mind	about	some	future	event	or	“in
the	 medical	 language,	 lowness	 of	 spirits	 with
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
103
uneasiness	 of	 the	 stomach”	 (p.	 89).	 By	 the	 late
eighteenth	 century	 it	 was	 clear	 that	 there	 was	 a
relationship	 between	 anxiety	 and	 depressive
sensations.	For	the	practicing	clinician	today,	the
important	distinction	is	between	the	fear	of	some
real	 external	 danger	 and	 anxiety,	 which	 may	 be
thought	of	as	an	irrational	fear	of	some	anticipated
event.	 This	 irrational	 fear	 is	 based	 on	 the	 great
calamities	that	comprise	the	terrors	of	childhood:
loss	of	the	mother	or	parenting	object,	loss	of	the
love	of	the	mother	or	parenting	object,	castration,
and	
guilt	
that	
demands	
punishment.	
The
symptoms	 of	 anxiety	 are	 well	 known	 and	 the
concept	has	been	used	by	continental	thinkers	to
represent	 a	 sort	 of	 existential	 malaise.	 The
symptoms	 of	 acute	 anxiety	 form	 one	 clinical
extreme	 and	 shade	 off	 to	 the	 symptoms	 of	 a
generalized	 discomfort	 and	 malaise	 at	 the	 other
end	of	the	spectrum.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
104
Freud’s	 earliest	 explanation	 for	 anxiety	 was
that	it	represented	the	transformation	of	dammed
up	 sexual	 toxins	 that	 were	 not	 being	 properly
discharged.	 He	 (1926)	 revised	 this	 in	 a	 very
significant	 paper,	 in	 which	 he	 presents	 his	 so-
called	signal	theory	of	anxiety,	vitally	important	to
understanding	 the	 formation,	 diagnosis,	 and
treatment	of	neurotic	and	character	disorders.	It	is
interesting	that	Freud	does	not	discuss	anxiety	in
psychotic	 patients	 but	 confines	 his	 theoretical
work	on	the	subject	to	the	neuroses.	In	the	signal
theory	he	contends	that	anxiety	motivates	the	ego
to	inhibit	or	repress	when	there	is	conflict	with	the
id,	conflict	with	the	superego,	or	problems	within
the	 ego	 itself.	 When	 the	 ego	 is	 opposed	 to	 an
instinctual	process	in	the	id,	“it	has	only	to	give	a
signal	 of	 unpleasure	 in	 order	 to	 obtain	 its	 object
with	the	aid	of	that	almost	omnipotent	institution,
the	 pleasure	 principle”	 (p.	 92).	 Brenner	 (1982)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
105
claims	that	the	signal	of	unpleasure	that	initiates
repression	 can	 be	 either	 anxiety,	 if	 the	 fear	 is	 of
something	 that	 has	 not	 yet	 taken	 place,	 or
depression,	if	the	conviction	is	that	it	has	already
taken	 place,	 but	 this	 constitutes	 a	 significant
controversial	revision	of	Freud’s	signal	theory.
According	 to	 Freud,	 the	 ego	 borrows	 energy
cathected	 to	 the	 instinct	 that	 is	 to	 be	 repressed
and	uses	this	energy	for	the	purpose	of	releasing
unpleasure,	which	Freud	equates	with	a	feeling	of
anxiety.	 This	 unpleasure	 then	 mobilizes	 psychic
functions	along	the	pleasure	principle	and	sets	the
ego’s	
mechanisms	
of	
defense	
into	
action,
beginning	 with	 repression	 and	 utilizing	 others	 if
repression	 is	 not	 sufficient.	 Thus	 if	 the	 ego
successfully	 represses	 the	 instinct,	 we	 learn
nothing;	 we	 find	 out	 about	 this	 repression	 only
from	those	cases	in	which	the	repression	has	more
or	 less	 failed.	 In	 the	 event	 of	 failure	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
106
repression,	 a	 substitute	 formation	 occurs,	 very
much	 reduced,	 displaced,	 and	 inhibited,	 which	 is
no	 longer	 clearly	 recognizable	 as	 a	 satisfaction.
This	is	a	symptom.	A	symptom,	then,	is	a	sign	of,
and	a	substitute	for,	an	instinctual	satisfaction	that
has	 been	 forbidden	 direct	 gratification—it	 is	 a
consequence	of	the	process	of	repression.
Anxiety	 is	 thus	 conceived	 of	 by	 Freud	 as	 a
signal	 by	 the	 ego	 of	 a	 situation	 of	 a	 danger,	 and
subsequently	
obviated	
by	
the	
ego’s	
doing
something	to	avoid	that	situation	or	to	withdraw
from	 it.	 Symptoms	 are	 the	 ultimate	 result	 of
attempting	 to	 remove	 the	 danger	 situation
emerging	 from	 within,	 whose	 presence	 was
originally	signaled	by	the	generation	of	anxiety.
There	 are	 many	 forms	 of	 anxiety	 used
descriptively	 in	 the	 literature,	 such	 as	 castration
anxiety,	 separation	 anxiety,	 depressive	 anxiety,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
107
persecutory	
anxiety,	
neurotic	
anxiety,	
and
psychotic	
anxiety.	
These	
are	
essentially
descriptive	terms	and	do	not	imply	any	theory	of
the	origin	of	anxiety.	See	Compton	(1972a,b)	for	a
complete	review	of	the	topic.
A	subclass	of	the	anxiety	disorders	is	currently
known	 as	 the	 panic	 disorders	 (see	 PANIC
DISORDER),	which	are	thought	by	some	authors	to
have	
an	
organic	
origin.	
There	
remains
considerable	 controversy	 as	 to	 whether	 panic
disorders	should	be	treated	by	psychoanalysis	or
by	 a	 combination	 of	 psychopharmacology	 and
psychotherapy.	 Silber	 (1989)	 reports	 a	 case	 of
panic	 attacks	 experienced	 during	 the	 course	 of
analysis	 which	 had	 a	 psychological	 component
that	 proved	 “amenable	 to	 understanding	 and
amelioration	 in	 a	 classically	 conducted	 analysis”
(p.	362).	He	reminds	us	that	panic	attacks,	at	least
in	 part	 and	 in	 some	 patients,	 have	 an	 important
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
108
psychological	antecedent	and	therefore	should	not
be	 explained	 exclusively	 in	 physiological	 or
pharmacological	 terms,	 nor	 treated	 with	 an
exclusively	biological	orientation.

APHANISIS
Ernest	 Jones	 (1948)	 used	 this	 term	 to
represent	 the	 disappearance	 of	 sexual	 desire	 in
the	context	of	his	inquiries	into	feminine	sexuality.
He	had	in	mind	the	idea	that	the	fear	of	castration
was	simply	a	concrete	expression	of	a	more	basic
or	 general	 fear	 of	 “aphanisis,”	 which	 involves	 a
kind	 of	 total	 destruction	 or	 wiping	 out	 of	 the
psyche	involving	a	loss	of	all	capacity	for	pleasure,
especially	
sexual	
pleasure.	
This	
is	
to	
be
distinguished	
from	
anhedonia,	
which	
is	
a
descriptive	 term	 that	 represents	 the	 inability	 to
experience	any	kind	of	pleasure	whatsoever	and	is
more	 related	 to	 the	 depressive	 disorders	 rather
than	to	castration	anxiety.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org

It	 is	 perhaps	 helpful	 to	 remember	 that	 the
original	Greek	term	αϕανισις	(aphanisis)	is	a	noun
that	designates	the	getting	rid	of	something	or	the
destruction	 of	 something.	 The	 clinical	 use	 of	 this
term	was	an	attempt	by	Jones	to	find	a	common
basis	for	the	sexual	development	of	boys	and	girls
rather	than	simply	the	castration	complex	that	is
related	more	specifically	to	the	loss	of	the	penis.
Jones	was	never	comfortable	with	Freud’s	theory
of	 the	 psychosexual	 development	 of	 women
(see	FEMALE	PSYCHOLOGY).

ARCHAIC	TRANSFERENCES	AND	EGO	STATES
Something	is	called	archaic	when	it	stems	from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
111
a	 primitive	 condition	 or	 era.	 In	 the	 past
psychiatrists	 emphasized	 the	 archaic	 modes	 of
thinking	and	expression	in	the	schizophrenias;	an
important	
theory	
of	
the	
understanding	
of
schizophrenia	was	offered	by	Arieti	(1974)	based
on	 his	 concept	 of	 “paleological	 thinking”	 in
schizophrenia.	This	approach	to	schizophrenia	has
been	 largely	 abandoned	 as	 research	 into	 the
subject	has	progressed.
Clinicians	 today	 are	 more	 interested	 in
“archaic	 ego	 states,”	 which	 are	 attributed	 to	 the
early	 stages	 in	 the	 development	 of	 the	 ego.	 The
well-known	 “oceanic	 feeling”	 discussed	 by	 Freud
(1930)	 was	 provided	 by	 the	 author	 Romain
Rolland	(1866-1944)	and	involves	an	indissoluble
bond	 between	 the	 self	 and	 the	 external	 world,
which	Rolland	thought	was	the	basis	of	religious
experience	but	Freud	insisted	was	a	manifestation
of	
an	
archaic	
ego	
state.	
The	
transitional
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
112
phenomena	of	Winnicott	(1953)	and	the	selfobject
phenomena	 of	 Kohut	 (1971)	 are	 examples	 of
archaic	 ego	 or	 self	 states	 used	 as	 a	 descriptive
term.
Perhaps	 of	 the	 greatest	 importance	 for
clinicians,	 however,	 is	 the	 concept	 of	 archaic
transferences,	which	have	been	discussed	by	Gedo
(1977),	 myself	 (Chessick	 1989),	 and	 others.	 The
problem	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 the	 borderline	 or
difficult	patient	lies	in	the	extreme	stress	it	places
on	 the	 therapist	 to	 deal	 with	 disruptions,	 acting
out,	archaic	transference	challenges,	and	the	many
incessant	reality	problems	that	keep	impinging	on
the	patient’s	chaotic	life.	The	archaic	transference
presents	a	situation	in	which	the	patient	demands
an	 immediate	 response	 from	 the	 therapist.	 It	 is
fraught	 with	 difficulties.	 If	 the	 therapist	 is	 silent,
the	 patient	 becomes	 enraged	 at	 his	 or	 her
“rudeness”	in	not	offering	an	answer	to	his	or	her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
113
demand.	 But	 obviously	 any	 definitive	 answer	 to
the	 demand	 based	 on	 the	 material	 would	 be	 the
wrong	answer	and	would	be	met	with	objections,
denials,	 and	 possibly	 even	 an	 irrational	 enraged
situation.
The	 question	 of	 how	 to	 respond	 to	 archaic
transference	 challenges	 is	 very	 thorny.	 In	 the
management	 of	 difficult	 patients	 one	 should
provide	only	direct	gratification	when	forced	to	do
so	 in	 order	 to	 preserve	 the	 therapy.	 Even	 then
there	is	a	limit	to	the	direct	gratification	that	can
be	provided.	This	is	discussed	most	poignantly	by
Freud	(1905)	in	his	postscript	to	the	case	of	Dora.
The	rule	of	abstinence	(see	ABSTINENCE)	should
be	 followed	 as	 much	 as	 possible,	 even	 with
difficult	patients,	and	the	therapist	should	not	step
out	 of	 the	 analytic	 stance	 any	 more	 than	 is
absolutely	 necessary.	 It	 goes	 without	 saying	 that
the	 therapist	 should	 never	 step	 out	 of	 an	 ethical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
114
stance	 regardless	 of	 the	 circumstances,	 as	 this	 is
always	countertransference	acting	out	on	the	part
of	the	therapist	and	always	contraindicated.
A	transference	is	archaic	if	the	patient	has	no
insight	 into	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 therapist
and	the	parenting	object,	so	that	the	demand	is	for
immediate	 gratification	 and	 no	 amount	 of
explanation	or	discussion	will	suffice.	In	this	sense
it	is	not	a	typical	transference	in	which	libidinal	or
aggressive	drives	cross	the	repression	barrier	and
are	aimed	at	the	object	of	the	therapist.	Rather,	it
is	an	intrapsychic	amalgamation	of	the	therapist’s
self	with	the	patient’s	self,	in	which	the	therapist	is
experienced	 as	 an	 extension	 of	 the	 patient	 and
expected	
to	
yield	
to	
total	
control.	
All
psychotherapists	 who	 work	 with	 a	 variety	 of
patients	are	the	aim	of	these	archaic	transferences
from	time	to	time;	furthermore,	they	are	often	the
cause	 of	 serious	 countertransference	 acting	 out
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
115
with	 disruptions	 and	 destructive	 events	 in	 both
the	 lives	 of	 the	 patients	 and	 the	 therapists.	 The
proper	management	of	the	archaic	transference	is
one	 of	 the	 hardest	 and	 most	 important	 tasks	 to
learn	
in	
the	
art	
and	
craft	
of	
intensive
psychotherapy.

“AS-IF”	PERSONALITY
This	 refers	 to	 a	 classical	 paper	 by	 Deutsch
(1965),	 in	 which	 she	 designated	 persons	 that
today	 would	 probably	 be	 labeled	 borderline
personality	 disorders.	 These	 individuals	 seem	 to
fit	 into	 any	 situation,	 creating	 an	 illusion	 of
conviction	 and	 involvement,	 whereas	 in	 reality
there	 is	 an	 absence	 of	 depth	 and	 emotional
experience.	 The	 importance	 of	 this	 kind	 of
disorder	is	that	if	it	is	not	properly	identified	by
the	 clinician,	 a	 miscarriage	 of	 the	 psychotherapy
takes	 place.	 A	 patient	 appears	 to	 be	 cooperating
and	stabilizing	with	therapeutic	progress	until,	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
117
time	passes,	the	therapist	realizes	that	nothing	is
really	happening	and	the	patient	has	not	achieved
any	change	at	all	in	his	or	her	actual	life.	Deutsch
thought	 of	 the	 “as-if”	 personality	 as	 a	 type	 of
schizoid	individual	who	behaves	as	though	he	or
she	had	normal	emotional	responses	to	situations
but	 actually	 is	 empty.	 Today	 we	 think	 of	 such
patients	more	in	terms	of	narcissistic	personality
disorders	or,	with	Kohut,	as	disorders	of	the	self.
The	“as-if”	personality	represents	an	extreme
caricature	 of	 Riesman	 and	 colleagues’	 (1955)
“other-directed”	personality.	Although	the	patient
appears	 outwardly	 amiable,	 he	 or	 she	 has	 no
identity	of	his	own	and	is	not	capable	of	forming
any	 genuine	 emotional	 attachment	 to	 people	 or
moral	principles.	While	there	is	a	poverty	of	object
relationships	and	again	the	central	issue	seems	to
revolve	 around	 narcissism,	 no	 obvious	 defect	 in
reality	 testing	 is	 present;	 in	 fact,	 the	 “as-if”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
118
personality	 may	 become	 a	 very	 successful
politician	or	administrator.

AUTHENTIC
The	 terms	 “authentic”	 and	 “inauthentic”	 are
used	by	a	variety	of	continental	philosophers	and
psychologists	in	different	ways.	The	concept	was
originally	introduced	by	Heidegger	(1962)	as	one
of	 two	 ways	 of	 living	 in	 the	 world.	 In	 the
inauthentic	manner	one	has	“concern”	for	people
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
119
as	 things	 or	 objects	 (the	 word	 “concern”	 in
Heidegger	 has	 no	 moral	 connotation	 and	 merely
implies	
Kierkegaardian	
interestedness	
or
curiosity).	 In	 authentic	 living	 there	 is	 a	 binding
with	people	by	devotion	to	common	causes,	which
Heidegger	 called	 “solicitude,”	 that	 is	 achieved	 by
“resolve.”
Heidegger	claimed	that	this	solicitude	is	what
has	 been	 lost	 in	 our	 age.	 In	 place	 of	 it,
inauthentically,	we	have	relationships	with	people
based	 on	 what	 he	 called	 (a)	 competitiveness,
which	 sets	 us	 apart	 from	 each	 other;	 (b)
publicness,	 which	 suppresses	 the	 exceptional	 by
an	 obsession	 with	 promoting	 a	 “well-rounded”
personality;	(c)	average	ness—what	one	ought	to
do	 to	 fit	 in;	 and	 above	 all,	 (d)	 adaptation,	 which
later	 gave	 ammunition	 for	 considerable	 attack
from	some	continental	psychoanalysts	on	the	U.S.
psychoanalytic	 ego-psychology	 school	 with	 its
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
120
central	aim	of	adaptation.	Heidegger	claimed	that
all	such	inauthentic	relationships	result	in	our	age
in	 “fallenness”	 into	 the	 “they”	 or	 public	 world,
which	 relieves	 one	 of	 personal	 responsibility	 by
such	arguments	as	“Everybody	does	it,”	or,	“I	was
just	following	orders.”
This	 concept	 of	 inauthentic	 and	 authentic
existence	was	emphasized	by	Sartre,	who	utilized
it	 to	 distinguish	 between	 acts	 that	 are	 done	 in
good	 faith	 and	 those	 based	 on	 bad	 faith.
Inauthentic	 behavior	 is	 usually	 interpreted	 by
psychotherapists	 as	 defensive	 behavior,	 with	 the
implication	 that	 the	 patient’s	 real	 feelings	 and
motives	are	other	than	the	patient	realizes	or	that
the	patient	was	insincere	and	in	bad	faith	in	order
to	avoid	confronting	some	aspect	of	the	situation
or	of	the	patient,	which	would	have	led	to	anxiety
(see	also	FALSE	SELF).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
121
These	 are	 all	 descriptive	 terms	 and	 are
interchangeable;	 they	 have	 no	 metapsychological
or	psychodynamic	basis.	The	problem	with	the	use
of	the	terms	“authentic”	and	“inauthentic”	is	that
they	 carry	 a	 moral	 connotation.	 Calling	 someone
“inauthentic”	has	a	pejorative	tone,	and	it	is	best	if
psychotherapists	
leave	
these	
issues	
to
philosophers.	When	a	patient	begins	complaining
that	he	or	she	feels	“inauthentic”	or	is	leading	an
“inauthentic”	 life,	 this	 should	 be	 heard	 by	 the
therapist	 as	 a	 complaint	 of	 malaise	 under	 which
there	 are	 hidden,	 important	 psychodynamic
conflicts.	 To	 respond	 to	 these	 complaints	 with
discussions	 of	 existential	 issues	 is	 to	 respond	 to
manifest	content	and	to	enter	into	a	collusion	with
the	
patient	
to	
avoid	
the	
unfolding	
and
interpretation	 of	 the	 transference	 and	 the
investigation	 of	 the	 infantile	 conflicts	 that	 are
plaguing	the	patient’s	current	adult	life.

AUTOEROTISM,
AUTOEROTICISM
Autoerotism	was	introduced	by	Havelock	Ellis
in	 1889	 to	 refer	 to	 a	 form	 of	 sexual	 behavior	 in
which	 the	 subject	 obtained	 satisfaction	 solely
through	the	recourse	to	his	or	her	own	body	and
needing	 no	 outside	 object.	 The	 usual	 example	 of
autoerotic	behavior	is	masturbation.	Freud	(1905)
made	 use	 of	 the	 term	 to	 describe	 infantile
sexuality.	 He	 regarded	 earliest	 infantile	 sexual
behavior	
as	
attaining	
satisfaction	
without
resorting	to	an	external	object,	so	that	the	instinct
is	 not	 directed	 toward	 other	 people	 but	 obtains
satisfaction	 from	 the	 subject’s	 own	 body.	 This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
123
implies	 that	 there	 is	 no	 inborn	 ready-made	 path
that	directs	the	newborn	toward	a	predetermined
object.	 It	 represents	 an	 archaic	 stage	 before	 the
formation	of	the	ego.
When	the	ego	has	formed,	primary	narcissism
occurs,	in	which	the	libidinal	object	is	the	unified
image	of	the	body	or	the	ego.	But	autoerotism	is	an
archaic	 stage	 preceding	 this	 convergence	 of	 the
component	 instincts	 on	 the	 ego.	 Freud	 claimed
that	 the	 autoerotic	 instincts	 are	 there	 from	 the
beginning	 and	 converge	 on	 the	 various	 zones	 of
the	 body	 in	 a	 primal	 state	 before	 the	 ego	 has
formed.
This	 distinction	 was	 gradually	 abandoned	 by
Freud,	who	came	to	feel	that	there	was	a	state	of
primary	narcissism	from	the	beginning	of	life.	He
then	used	the	definition	of	autoerotism	simply	in
the	 first	 sense	 given	 above,	 namely,	 the	 use	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
124
one’s	 own	 body	 for	 sexual	 gratification.	 There	 is
some	 confusion	 in	 Freud’s	 views	 as	 to	 whether
there	is	an	autoerotic	libidinal	stage	as	contrasted
to	 adult	 sexual	 activity,	 which	 involves	 object
choice.	Freud	loosely	thought	of	a	developmental
line	from	autoerotism	through	narcissism	to	adult
object	 love,	 but	 the	 concept	 of	 autoerotism	 as	 a
sharply	demarcated	stage	in	time	came	from	Karl
Abraham	(1916).
The	confusion	in	this	concept	comes	from	the
fact	that	in	using	autoerotism	as	a	description	of
getting	 pleasure	 from	 one’s	 own	 body,	 we	 are
making	a	descriptive	definition	that	is	observable,
whereas	 the	 definition	 of	 it	 as	 a	 stage	 in
development	 is	 inferential	 regarding	 the	 infant’s
disregard	 of	 external	 objects.	 The	 question	 of
whether	 the	 infant	 is	 or	 is	 not	 born	 oriented
toward	 external	 objects	 is	 one	 of	 the	 basic	 and
fundamental	 sources	 of	 disagreement	 among
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
125
psychoanalytic	theorists.	The	general	trend	at	the
current	time	is	to	believe	that	such	an	orientation
is	indeed	inborn,	in	contrast	to	Freud’s	idea	that	it
develops	 only	 along	 a	 line	 in	 which	 fundamental
object	relatedness	is	not	primary.	So-called	object
relations	theorists	such	as	Fairbairn	(1954)	insist
that	 the	 infant	 is	 mother-related	 from	 the	 very
beginning;	 it	 is	 object	 seeking,	 not	 pleasure
seeking.
The	 controversy	 remains	 as	 to	 (a)	 whether
autoerotism	is	primary	and	makes	no	distinction
between	the	self	and	the	nonself,	paying	little	heed
to	
the	
external	
environment	
or	
to	
other
individuals	 who	 are	 present	 there;	 (b)	 whether
narcissism	 is	 the	 primary	 state,	 in	 which	 others
are	 perceived	 simply	 as	 an	 extension	 of	 the	 self
and	 all	 libido	 is	 directed	 upon	 the	 self;	 or	 (c)
whether	 object	 love	 is	 the	 primary	 state,	 as
subsequent	theorists	have	declared.	In	narcissism
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
126
the	infant	takes	its	own	body	as	a	love	object	so
that	 the	 ego	 or	 the	 “I”	 is	 recognizable,	 whereas
autoerotism	 comes	 before	 that	 time,	 if	 indeed	 it
represents	 a	 phase	 in	 development,	 when	 no
distinction	 is	 made	 between	 the	 self	 and	 the
nonself.
For	 the	 clinician	 the	 use	 of	 autoerotism	 as	 a
developmental	stage	is	unnecessary	and	a	complex
unverifiable	 theoretical	 speculation.	 It	 is	 best	 to
restrict	the	use	of	this	concept	to	the	descriptive
definition	 and	 to	 keep	 in	 mind	 that	 autoerotic
behavior	takes	place	at	any	stage	of	life	and	simply
represents	a	statement	of	how	the	given	individual
is	 obtaining	 pleasure	 at	 any	 given	 time.	 This
deprives	the	term	of	any	sort	of	metapsychological
depth	 and	 reduces	 its	 importance	 substantially,
which	 I	 think	 is	 a	 good	 idea.	 The	 term
autoeroticism	is	sometimes	used	interchangeably
with	autoerotism.

B
BAD	OBJECT
A	loose	terminological	usage	of	part	and	whole
objects	
pervades	
the	
Kleinian	
literature,
sometimes	 referring	 to	 representations	 and
sometimes	referring	to	the	object	itself.	The	use	of
the	 term	 “bad”	 has	 a	 special	 meaning	 in
metapsychology.	It	can	qualify	either	part	objects,
such	as	the	breast	or	the	penis,	or	whole	objects,
such	 as	 mother	 or	 father,	 or	 representations	 or
images	 of	 either	 part	 or	 whole	 objects.	 This	 was
made	 specific	 and	 more	 precise	 by	 Kernberg
(1976,	 1980),	 who	 emphasized	 the	 “splitting”
process	
early	
in	
development	
in	
which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
129
representations	are	divided	into	“good”	and	“bad”
(see	 SPLITTING).	 The	 “bad”	 self	 and	 object
representations	 imply	 that	 they	 are	 frustrating,
hateful,	 frightening,	 malevolent,	 and	 persecuting,
all	 borrowed	 from	 Klein’s	 original	 notions.	 The
source	of	these	bad	objects,	according	to	Klein,	is
the	 sadistic	 aggression	 of	 the	 death	 instinct
originally	 turned	 on	 the	 infant	 but	 deflected	 for
self-preservative	 purposes	 onto	 these	 “all	 bad”
objects.	For	Kernberg	in	his	early	work,	an	excess
of	 constitutional	 aggression	 invested	 these	 split-
off	bad	objects	with	their	negative	valence;	in	his
later	 work	 early	 experiences	 produced	 the
negative	 valence.	 The	 point	 is	 that	 a	 postulated
splitting	occurs	early	in	life	into	“all	good”	and	“all
bad”	 self	 and	 object	 representations,	 which	 are
kept	separate	until	around	six	to	eight	months,	the
second	
subphase	
of	
Mahler’s	
separation-
individuation	stage.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
130
For	Kernberg	(1976)	the	first	month	of	life	is
relatively	 undifferentiated.	 By	 the	 second	 to	 the
sixth	or	eighth	month	the	infant	forms	images	or
representations	 or	 constellations	 that	 are	 “all
good”	and	separate	from	those	that	are	“all	bad.”
However,	 in	 this	 period	 between	 the	 second
month	and	the	sixth	to	eighth	month	there	is	no
distinction	
between	
self	
and	
object
representations,	either	under	the	“good”	or	“bad”
group.	Near	the	end	of	this	stage,	from	the	sixth	to
ninth	 month,	 however,	 the	 representations	 are
differentiated	 between	 those	 of	 the	 self	 and	 the
object,	both	under	the	“good”	group	and	the	“bad”
group.	Then,	in	the	period	of	six	to	eight	months	to
one	and	a	half	to	three	years,	the	“good”	and	“bad”
self	representations	are	combined	into	a	group	of
self	 representations	 and	 divided	 from	 the	 object
representations,	 which	 are	 similarly	 combined.
This	 division	 permits	 object	 constancy	 to	 occur.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
131
From	the	end	of	the	third	year	to	the	end	of	the
oedipal	 phase,	 the	 split	 “good”	 and	 “bad”	 self
representations	 are	 integrated	 and	 neutralized
into	a	total	self	representation;	similarly,	the	split
“good”	 and	 “bad”	 object	 representations	 are
integrated	into	a	total	object	representation.
If	 this	 integrative	 process	 does	 not	 occur,
according	 to	 Kernberg,	 the	 patient	 has	 the
potential	to	be	stuck	in	what	he	calls	a	borderline
personality	 organization.	 Such	 a	 patient	 readily
projects	
the	
“all	
bad”	
self	
and	
object
representations	 onto	 the	 therapist	 and	 reacts
accordingly.	 This	 is	 the	 process	 of	 projective
identification	that	Kernberg	says	accounts	for	the
clinical	 phenomena	 seen	 with	 the	 borderline
patient.

BASIC	FAULT
This	term	was	used	by	Balint	(1952)	to	depict
what	are	commonly	referred	to	as	patients	whose
difficulties	 are	 preoedipal	 and	 for	 whom	 the
Oedipus	 complex	 is	 not	 the	 nucleus	 of	 their
neuroses.	 Such	 patients	 include	 the	 well-known
character	 disorders,	 borderline	 personalities,
addicts,	schizophrenics,	and	so	forth,	all	of	whom
need	 what	 Balint	 called	 a	 “new	 beginning”	 in
therapy,	or	what	Fromm-Reichmann	(1950)	called
patients	 who	 need	 an	 experience	 and	 not	 an
explanation	 in	 their	 treatment.	 The	 concept	 of
“basic	fault”	was	a	way	station	toward	the	gradual
recognition	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 present	 century
that	many	of	the	patients	we	see	in	psychotherapy
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
133
have	disorders	that	do	not	primarily	arise	in	the
oedipal	 phase	 of	 development	 and	 are	 different
from	Freud’s	classical	psychoneuroses.
Balint	 hoped	 to	 treat	 these	 patients	 by
allowing	 a	 benign	 regression	 to	 occur	 until	 the
patient	reached	what	he	called	an	“arglos”	state.	In
such	a	state	the	analyst	could	literally	correct	the
basic	 fault	 by	 an	 appropriate	 humane	 encounter
with	the	patient.	A	modern	version	of	this	in	much
more	sophisticated	terminology	was	developed	by
Kohut	(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).

BASE,
SUPERSTRUCTURE
These	 are	 Marxist	 terms	 that	 refer	 to	 the
hypothesis	 that	 human	 personality,	 culture,	 and
history	 are	 all	 a	 function	 of	 the	 means	 of
production.	 The	 economics	 of	 a	 given	 culture,
which	 represents	 the	 means	 of	 production
employed	 by	 that	 culture,	 was	 designated	 as	 the
“base”	 by	 Marx.	 From	 it	 arise	 the	 history	 and
characteristics	of	the	given	culture	as	well	as	the
personality	 of	 the	 individuals	 who	 live	 in	 that
culture,	 including	 their	 philosophy,	 ethics,	 and
religion.	All	of	this	was	designated	by	Marx	as	the
“superstructure.”	 The	 importance	 of	 Marxist
contentions	for	psychotherapists	is	that	one	must
indeed	keep	in	mind	the	influence	of	the	particular
economic	 system	 under	 which	 one	 lives	 on	 the
formation	 of	 the	 personality	 of	 the	 patients	 with
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
135
whom	one	works.	One	must	also	keep	in	mind	the
influence	of	this	economic	base	on	one’s	self	and
one’s	 practice	 of	 psychotherapy	 (see	 Chessick
1992).
After	 1844	 Marx	 concentrated	 on	 economics,
which	culminated	in	his	controversial	masterpiece
Capital	 in	 1867.	 But	 already	 in	 1844	 he	 saw
capitalist	 economics	 as	 establishing	 an	 alienated
form	of	social	intercourse	and	argued	that	private
property,	 greed,	 and	 selfish	 materialism	 are	 a
product	 of	 this	 alienation.	 Marx	 maintained	 that
this	 is	 not	 natural	 to	 humans.	 He	 viewed	 the
human	as	a	“species-being,”	a	notion	he	borrowed
from	 the	 philosopher	 Ludwig	 Feuerbach	 (1804-
1872).	Wood	(1981)	gives	an	excellent	discussion
of	the	problem	of	alienation	and	the	importance	of
species	consciousness	as	it	appears	in	the	work	of
Marx.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
136
For	 the	 purposes	 of	 psychotherapists,	 Marx’s
(1963)	Economic	and	Philosophical	Manuscripts	of
1844	is	most	significant.	In	this	work	he	visualizes
a	 change	 in	 the	 capitalist	 system	 as	 producing	 a
better	sort	of	human	being,	creative	and	altruistic,
and	 with	 more	 autonomy,	 because	 he	 thought	 of
human	psychology	to	a	large	extent	as	the	product
of	the	economic	base.	He	argued,	following	Hegel,
that	 there	 was	 no	 immutable	 nature	 in	 humans,
only	various	potentials.	These	were	the	potential
for	self-determination,	autonomy,	and	choices;	the
potential	 of	 sociality—man	 as	 a	 species	 being—
because	all	human	activity	has	a	social	dimension
and	humans	can	empathize	and	cooperate;	and	the
potential	for	aesthetic	enjoyment	and	the	capacity
for	disinterested	contemplation.	Marx	claimed	that
the	 actualization	 of	 these	 wonderful	 potentials
was	interfered	with	by	the	economic	base	of	our
culture,	capitalism.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
137
The	 sense	 of	 “alienation,”	 which	 comes	 up	 so
often	in	psychotherapy	as	a	complaint	by	patients,
was	first	stressed	by	Hegel,	who	thought	of	it	as	a
separation	 from	 identification	 with	 the	 World
Spirit.	 Subsequently,	 Feuerbach	 argued	 that	 we
are	alienated	when	we	believe	in	any	extrahuman
entity,	 including	 a	 World	 Spirit,	 a	 view	 just	 the
opposite	 of	 Hegel.	 Both	 Hegel	 and	 Feuerbach
thought	 alienation	 needed	 to	 be	 overcome	 by
correcting	 intellectual	 error,	 but	 Marx	 believed
that	 one	 must	 change	 the	 world	 and	 remove
disabling	 social	 institutions	 in	 order	 to	 remove
alienation,	
not	
just	
give	
intellectual
interpretations.	This	is	obviously	of	great	interest
to	 psychotherapists	 for	 many	 reasons.	 Also,	 it
parallels	 the	 contemporary	 argument	 whether
intensive	
psychotherapy	
or	
psychoanalysis
functions	 primarily	 through	 cognitive	 insights
provided	 by	 interpretations	 alone	 or	 through
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
138
some	kind	of	actual	change	in	the	patient	directly
brought	 about	 by	 the	 experience	 with	 the

BEATING	FANTASY
(see	also	MASOCHISM)
Freud’s	(1919)	classic	paper	entitled	“A	Child
Is	 Being	 Beaten”	 discussed	 beating	 fantasies
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
139
accompanying	 masturbation.	 According	 to	 Freud,
in	the	girl	such	fantasies	go	through	three	stages	of
development.	 In	 the	 first	 stage,	 the	 father	 is
beating	 a	 sibling;	 next,	 he	 beats	 the	 girl	 herself.
Finally,	 he	 beats	 the	 other	 children	 again,	 but
these	 are	 boys	 and	 need	 not	 be	 siblings.	 Beating
fantasies	accompanying	masturbation	in	the	boy,
according	to	Freud,	develop	in	two	stages.	In	the
first	stage,	the	father	beats	the	boy;	in	the	second,
the	 mother	 beats	 the	 boy.	 Freud	 believed	 these
fantasies	
to	
originate	
from	
an	
incestuous
attachment	 to	 the	 father.	 The	 boy	 evades	 the
threat	 of	 homosexuality	 by	 transforming	 the
beating	father	into	the	beating	mother,	while	the
girl	 in	 fantasy	 becomes	 a	 boy	 and	 derives
masochistic	 pleasure	 from	 what	 on	 the	 surface
appears	to	be	a	sadistic	beating	fantasy.
More	 generally,	 in	 beating	 fantasies	 the
fantasizer	 may	 identify	 with	 either	 the	 person
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
140
doing	the	beating	or	the	person	being	beaten,	or
both.	The	person	doing	the	beating	has	a	role	that
is	 usually	 connected	 with	 phallic	 aggression	 or
sadism,	 while	 the	 person	 being	 beaten	 has	 an
unconscious	 role	 of	 passivity	 and	 feminine
masochism.
Certainly	 sibling	 rivalry	 is	 expressed	 in	 these
fantasies,	but	the	fact	that	they	are	masturbatory
indicates	a	deeper	incestuous	origin.	In	my	clinical
experience,	girls	and	women	do	not	always	go	to
the	
third	
stage	
to	
achieve	
masturbatory
satisfaction	 but	 can	 complete	 masturbation	 to
orgasm	 with	 the	 fantasy	 of	 being	 directly	 beaten
by	their	father	or	other	male	figures,	or,	when	the
transference	has	developed,	by	the	therapist.
It	 is	 of	 historical	 interest,	 as	 discussed	 by
Young-Bruehl	(1988),	that	Anna	Freud’s	paper	on
“Beating	
Fantasies	
and	
Daydreams,”	
which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
141
resumes	the	topic	of	her	father’s	paper,	may	be	a
self-description.	This	was	apparently	an	important
masturbatory	 theme	 for	 her,	 and	 she	 was	 in
“analysis”	 with	 her	 father	 at	 the	 time	 the	 paper
was	 written.	 Young-Bruehl	 suggests	 that	 one	 of
the	 cases	 reported	 in	 Freud’s	 classic	 paper	 (the
fifth)	was	that	of	his	daughter.	Perhaps	some	day
when	 more	 documents	 are	 released	 we	 will
understand	
the	
mind-boggling	
relationship
between	 Freud	 and	 his	 daughter,	 analyst	 and
analysand,	a	lot	better.	As	in	contemporary	cases,
the	masturbatory	beating	fantasies	of	Anna	Freud
offer	us	a	tantalizing	clue	but	insufficient	material
by	themselves	to	reach	any	conclusions.

BEYOND	INTERPRETATION
(GEDO)
With	this	title,	John	Gedo	(1979)	offers	his	own
psychoanalytic	 metapsychology	 based	 on	 his
notion	 of	 self-organization	 and	 arising	 from	 his
study	of	preoedipal	disorders.	This	begins	a	series
of	explorations	on	Gedo’s(1981,	1986,	1988)	part
in	 the	 study	 of	 patients	 who	 present	 archaic
demands	
based	
on	
preoedipal	
problems.
According	to	him,	these	are	compensatory	efforts
to	patch	over	developmental	deficits,	actual	skills
that	 the	 patient	 lacks.	 He	 calls	 these	 an
accumulation	of	functional	handicaps	produced	by
early	 developmental	 vicissitudes.	 Gedo	 (1981)
believes	 that	 the	 treatment	 of	 this	 is	 beyond
interpretation:	 “In	 such	 cases,	 psychoanalysis
must	be	attempted	to	correct	the	structuralization
of	maladaptive	patterns”	(p.	57),	a	kind	of	repair
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
143
job	applied	to	the	early	maladaptive	practices.
Gedo	 (1986)	 says	 that	 Freud’s	 structural
theory	is	applicable	only	from	the	latter	half	of	the
second	 year	 of	 life,	 at	 the	 earliest.	 This	 is	 a
function	of	the	acquisition	of	imaging	capacity	in
which	 the	 mental	 self	 and	 representational
intelligence,	in	Piaget’s	terms,	gradually	take	over.
But	 underlying	 this	 are	 the	 archaic	 phases	 of
infantile	organization	with	derivatives	that	are	not
necessarily	
ever	
encoded	
in	
linguistic
communications.	 Gedo	 (1986)	 points	 out,	 in	 his
discussion	of	various	psychosomatic	disorders	and
psychophysiological	dysfunctions	characteristic	of
archaic	 or	 borderline	 states,	 “Adequate	 behavior
depends	 on	 a	 variety	 of	 psychological	 skills,
beyond	 those	 of	 perception	 and	 cognition,	 for
pathology	of	this	kind	comes	about	when	primary
bodily	 experiences	 are	 not	 assimilated	 into	 the
individual’s	 set	 of	 acknowledged	 personal	 aims”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
144
(p.	175).
Gedo	 (1988)	 refers	 to	 deficiencies	 caused	 by
any	failure	to	learn	adaptively	essential	skills	as	a
form	 of	 apraxia.	 He	 adds	 that	 organic	 damage	 is
not	implied	in	his	use	of	this	term,	although	in	my
clinical	
experience,	
especially	
in	
the
psychotherapy	 of	 patients	 with	 epilepsy,	 this
problem	is	especially	pronounced	in	patients	with
concomitant	organic	problems.	Whether	adaptive
skills	 are	 lacking	 due	 to	 maturational	 lag,
constitutional	 factors,	 inadequate	 nurture,	 or	 a
combination	 of	 these	 is	 not	 the	 relevant	 issue	 in
understanding	 the	 psychopathology.	 For	 patients
with	 apraxia,	 Gedo	 (1988)	 views	 therapy	 as	 a
“technology	of	instruction”	(p.	9).	People	get	into
difficulty	
not	
only	
from	
certain	
behaviors
produced	 by	 the	 repetition	 of	 certain	 response
patterns	established	in	infancy	or	early	childhood
but	also	from	maladaptive	or	troublesome	types	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
145
conduct	 that	 result	 from	 apraxia—“failure,	 for
whatever	
reason,	
to	
acquire	
essential
psychological	skills”	(p.	17).	The	demonstration	of
these	 skills	 to	 the	 patients	 Gedo	 calls	 “beyond
interpretation”;	
he	
considers	
this	
remedial
education	 as	 vital,	 since	 “even	 remediable
instances	of	disorders	in	thought,	communication,
learning,	planning,	affectivity,	or	the	regulation	of
tensions	 will	 not	 respond	 to	 the	 resolution	 of
intrapsychic	 conflicts—disorders	 of	 this	 type
require	
a	
variety	
of	
interventions	
that
psychoanalysts	
have	
hitherto	
regarded	
as
‘nonanalytic’	 educational	 measures”	 (p.	 28)	 (see
AFTEREDUCATION).
Gedo	(1988)	insists	that	his	noninterpretative
interventions	are	not	simply	direct	instruction	but
also	concentrate	on	reconstructing	the	childhood
circumstances	 that	 prevented	 the	 acquisition	 of
the	 proper	 skills	 in	 the	 first	 place,	 such	 as	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
146
identification	 with	 a	 sick	 parent,	 anxiety	 about
progress,	a	need	to	safeguard	autonomy	through
rejecting	external	influences,	grandiosity	(in	which
the	person	feels	so	perfect	that	he	or	she	has	no
need	 for	 skills),	 and	 too	 much	 frustration	 and
disappointment	
in	
the	
caretaker.	
The
identification	 with	 a	 sick	 parent	 may	 produce
“focal	disorders”	(p.	188)	in	thinking	because	the
parent	 identified	 with	 suffered	 from	 the	 same
handicaps,	
a	
common	
clinical	
situation.
Obsessional	 thinking	 for	 Gedo	 can	 be	 due	 to	 an
apraxia	in	planning	behavior,	due	to	a	situation	in
which	planning	behavior	“is	drawn	into	the	arena
of	 a	 toddler’s	 struggles	 about	 complying	 with
parental	expectations	or	resisting	them”	(p.	197).
In	 every	 case,	 according	 to	 Gedo,	 apparent
apraxias	 appearing	 in	 psychoanalytic	 treatment
must	be	labeled	as	either	a	temporary	regression,
an	 apraxia	 and	 ignorance	 of	 the	 rules	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
147
communication,	 or	 an	 identification	 with	 bizarre
caretakers.	 The	 primary	 apraxias	 will	 require	 a
variety	 of	 interventions	 “beyond	 interpretation,”
as	 Gedo	 (1988)	 explains	 it,	 “designed	 to	 correct
deficiencies	in	psychological	skills	resulting	from
unfavorable	
developmental	
vicissitudes	
and
transcending	the	matter	of	learning	to	forego	the
use	 of	 defensive	 operations.	 In	 this	 sense,	 the
model	 technique	 designed	 to	 deal	 with	 the
transference	 neuroses,	 that	 of	 promoting	 ‘ego
dominance’	
in	
the	
areas	
of	
unresolved
intrapsychic	 conflict”	 (p.	 213),	 that	 is,	 classical
psychoanalysis,	is	not	sufficient.

BIPOLAR	SELF
Kohut’s	 books,	 The	 Restoration	 of	 the	 Self
(1977)	 and	 How	 Does	 Analysis	 Cure?	 (1984),
contain	his	final	views	stressing	the	two	“poles”	of
the	supraordinate	concept:	bipolar	self.
These	 two	 poles	 are	 ambitions,	 derived	 from
the	
grandiose	
self	
and	
its	
strivings	
for
exhibitionistic	 ambitious	 acclaim	 and	 mirroring;

149
and	guiding	ideals	and	the	pursuit	of	them,	derived
from	internalization	of	the	idealized	parent	imago.
In	psychotherapy	one	pole	may	be	strengthened	to
compensate	 for	 defects	 in	 the	 other,	 a	 process
known	 as	 functional	 rehabilitation	 of	 the	 self.
Defensive	structures	(such	as	common	fantasies	of
sadistically	 enforced	 control	 and	 acclaim)	 may
develop	 to	 mask	 defects,	 and	 more	 hopeful
compensatory	 structures	 (such	 as	 the	 more
constructive	
pursuits	
of

filling	 a	 defect	 in	 the	 self	 by	 transmuting
internalizations	
in	
the	
transference	
or
strengthening	 the	 compensatory	 structures	 by
making	 them	 functionally	 reliable,	 realistic,	 and
autonomous,	which	would	not	constitute	a	cure	in
classical	psychoanalysis.

For	 children	 of	 8	 months	 to	 3	 years	 of	 age,
Kohut	postulates	a	normal,	intermediate	phase	of
powerful	narcissistic	cathexis	of	the	grandiose	self
(a	grandiose	exhibitionistic	image	of	the	self)	and
the	 idealized	 parent	 imago	 (the	 image	 of	 an
omnipotent	 selfobject	 with	 whom	 fusion	 is
desired).	 These	 psychic	 formations	 are	 gradually
internalized	 and	 integrated	 within	 the	 psychic
structure.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 appropriate	 minor
disappointments,	 the	 grandiosity	 is	 integrated	 at
around	2	to	4	years	of	age	(Kohut	1977);	it	forms
the	nuclear	ambitions	pole	of	the	self,	driving	the
individual	 forward,	 and	 derives	 mainly	 from	 the
relationship	 with	 the	 mother.	 In	 Kohut’s	 final
theory,	“the	psychology	of	the	self	in	the	broader
sense,”	 the	 self	 and	 ego	 are	 separated	 and	 the
internalized	grandiose	self	is	thought	to	form	the
nuclear	ambitions	pole	of	the	self.
At	 4	 to	 6	 years	 of	 age	 (Kohut	 1977),	 at	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
151
height	 of	 the	 oedipal	 phase,	 the	 idealized	 parent
imago,	 which	 derives	 from	 both	 parents,	 is	 also
internalized	 and	 integrated.	 In	 Kohut’s	 earlier
theory,	it	was	thought	of	as	an	infusion	of	both	the
superego	 and	 the	 ego	 with	 the	 love	 and
admiration	 originally	 aimed	 at	 the	 idealized
parent	imago,	which	then	serves	as	a	vital	internal
source	of	self-esteem	and	the	basis	of	the	ego-ideal
aspect	of	the	superego	(see	EGO	IDEAL).	This	ego-
ideal	 forms	 a	 system	 toward	 which	 the	 person
aspires;	thus	the	individual	is	driven	from	below
by	nuclear	ambitions	and	pulled	from	above	by	the
egoideal.	 In	 the	 psychology	 of	 the	 self	 in	 the
broader	 sense,	 the	 consolidation	 of	 the	 idealized
parent	imago	forms	the	other	pole	of	the	self,	the
nuclear	ideals	pole.	This	notion	of	the	bipolar	self
is	the	crucial	concept	of	the	psychology	of	the	self
(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).

BORDERLINE
What	is	a	borderline	patient?	Signals	to	watch
for	 at	 the	 start	 of	 therapy	 are	 a	 sense	 of
entitlement,	 magical	 expectations	 or	 thinking,	 an
impaired	 differentiation	 between	 fantasy	 and
reality,	 episodes	 of	 anger	 and	 suspicion	 with	 no
sense	of	humor,	and	fears	of	rejection	or	hints	of
paranoia.	There	are	no	pathognomonic	symptoms
of	a	borderline	personality,	and	no	consensus	on
characteristic	
metapsychology,	
dynamics,	
or
precise	stage	of	failure	in	development	exists.	It	is
the	quality	of	the	therapist’s	ongoing	experiences
with	the	patient	that	is	key	to	the	diagnosis,	which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
153
introduces	 an	 unavoidable	 controversy	 about
establishing	 the	 diagnosis	 in	 some	 cases	 where
DSM-III-R	 criteria	 are	 not	 immediately	 apparent
(Chessick	1982).
It	is	not	necessary	to	insist	that	all	borderline
patients	are	arrested	at	one	specific	point	or	stage
in	development.	The	borderline	condition	arises	as
a	 consequence	 of	 the	 first	 three	 years	 of	 a
disastrous	 and	 disappointing	 ambience	 in	 the
mother-child	interaction	combined	with	genetic	or
constitutional	 factors,	 which	 is	 then	 complicated
by	the	inevitable	failure	of	an	appropriate	solution
to	the	Oedipus	complex.	The	role	of	the	father	is
also	very	important.	It	is	not	necessary	in	practical
clinical	work	to	have	recourse	to	a	highly	complex
theory	of	object	relations	in	dealing	with	the	day-
to-day	treatment,	although	the	temperament	and
cognitive	 functioning	 of	 some	 therapists	 may
require	such	an	elaborate	theoretical	structure	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
154
enhance	their	own	sense	of	understanding	of	the
patient.	I	question	the	value	of	speculations	based
on	 adult	 patient	 material	 as	 to	 what	 kind	 of
psychodynamic	processes	and	images	occur	in	the
mind	of	the	1-	or	2-year-old	child.
It	 is	 a	 mistake	 not	 to	 take	 into	 consideration
that	 a	 patient	 must	 undergo	 all	 developmental
phases	 by	 the	 time	 he	 or	 she	 comes	 into
treatment;	 certainly	 failures	 of	 the	 later	 phases
because	 of	 a	 faulty	 foundation	 or	 structure	 are
also	 going	 to	 affect	 the	 symptomatology	 and
behavior	of	the	patient.	I	am	unable	to	agree	that
there	is	a	specific	metapsychological	entity	called
borderline	 personality	 organization.	 I	 am	 not
convinced	 there	 will	 be	 much	 further	 theoretical
understanding	of	the	borderline	patient	because	I
am	
not	
convinced	
that	
it	
constitutes	
an
independent	autonomous	entity;	the	value	of	the
concept	 lies	 in	 the	 clinical	 descriptive	 diagnosis
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
155
with	the	implications	of	poor	ego	functioning	and
consequent	 special	 requirements	 for	 a	 proper
therapeutic	approach.
It	 is	 very	 misleading	 to	 label	 any	 patient	 one
does	not	understand	as	“borderline.”	For	example,
a	 patient	 reacting	 with	 rage	 to	 a	 gross	 empathic
failure	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 therapist	 is	 showing
neither	
a	
transference	
nor	
a	
borderline
personality	organization,	but	rather	is	responding
appropriately	to	deep	disappointment.	Borderline
patients	especially	react	with	angry	disruption	or
suicidal	behavior	to	therapies	that	they	intuitively
recognize	 are	 inappropriate	 to	 their	 intense
personal	 suffering,	 such	 as	 certain	 types	 of
counseling	 or	 so-called	 touching	 and	 feeling
treatments;	 these	 reactions	 are	 not	 simply
manifestations	 of	 psychopathology	 but	 rather
represent	
an	
increase	
in	
desperation	
and
disappointment	in	yet	another	encounter	with	lack
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
156
of	 empathy	 and	 inappropriate	 misunderstanding
of	the	patient’s	basic	needs	by	a	parental	figure.
I	have	no	objections	to	the	use	of	the	DSM-III-R
criteria	for	research	purposes	or	to	form	a	starting
point	in	the	establishment	of	the	diagnosis,	but	in
clinical	practice,	as	generally	agreed,	it	is	rare	that
patients	who	have	these	DSM-III-R	criteria	do	not
also	 have	 criteria	 for	 other	 forms	 of	 personality
disorder	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 There	 is	 a	 definitive
diagnostic	 difference	 between	 the	 borderline
patient	 and	 some	 character	 disorders	 on	 the
descriptive	criterion	that	in	the	latter,	one	set	of
well-known	 characterologic	 features	 consistently
predominates	 the	 clinical	 picture	 in	 a	 relatively
rigid	 and	 all-pervasive	 way;	 thus	 we	 have	 the
obsessive	 compulsive	 character,	 the	 narcissistic
character,	the	hysterical	character,	and	so	forth.	In
the	 borderline	 patient,	 however,	 as	 I	 (Chessick
1975,	 1983)	 have	 pointed	 out,	 any	 variety	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
157
neurotic	 or	 quasi-psychotic,	 psychosomatic,	 or
sociopathic	 symptoms,	 in	 any	 combination	 or
degree	 of	 severity,	 may	 be	 part	 of	 the	 initial
presenting	
complaint.	
Either	
a	
bizarre
combination	of	such	symptoms	may	cut	across	the
standard	nosology,	or	the	relative	preponderance
of	 any	 symptom	 group	 is	 frequently	 changing	 or
shifting.	The	borderline	patient	may	present	either
a	 very	 chaotic	 or	 stormy	 series	 of	 relationships
with	a	variety	of	people	or	a	bland	and	superficial
but	
relatively	
stable	
set	
of	
relationships.
Vagueness	 of	 complaint	 or	 even	 an	 amazingly
smooth	
or	
occasionally	
socially	
successful
personality	
may	
be	
encountered.	
Careful
investigation	 reveals	 a	 poverty	 of	 genuine
emotional	 relationships	 sometimes	 well	 hidden
behind	 even	 an	 attractive	 and	 personable	 social
facade.
The	 capacity	 for	 reality	 testing	 and	 ability	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
158
function	in	work	and	social	situations	are	not	as
catastrophically	impaired	in	borderline	patients	as
in	
schizophrenics,	
although	
the	
degree	
of
functioning	may	vary	from	time	to	time	and	may
be	 quite	 poor.	 On	 the	 whole,	 these	 patients	 are
able	 to	 maintain	 themselves,	 sometimes	 raise
families,	 and	 otherwise	 fit	 more	 or	 less	 into
society.	 Although	 their	 functioning	 is	 more
impaired	 than	 narcissistic	 personalities,	 they	 do
not	present	as	isolated	drifters,	chronic	hospital	or
long-term	
prison	
cases,	
totally	
antisocial
personalities,	 or	 chronic	 addicts.	 They	 have,
however,	often	tried	everything	and	may	present	a
variety	 of	 sexual	 deviations,	 but	 they	 are	 not
functionally	paralyzed	by	these	or	by	their	various
symptoms	 or	 anxieties	 for	 very	 long	 periods	 of
time.	
Borderline	
patients	
suffer	
from	
an
unpleasant	 but	 relatively	 stable	 and	 enduring
condition.	They	may	experience	what	appear	to	be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
159
transient	 psychotic	 episodes	 either	 for	 no
apparent	 reason	 or	 as	 a	 result	 of	 stress,	 alcohol,
drugs,	 improper	 psychotherapy,	 and	 so	 on,	 but
they	do	not	remain	psychotic	for	long.	They	snap
out	of	it	and	often	learn	what	will	snap	them	out	of
it	and	administer	a	self-remedy,	which	sometimes
consists	of	dangerous	acting	out.
One	is	usually	compelled	to	be	more	active	in
the	 psychotherapy	 of	 borderline	 patients	 than	 in
the	 treatment	 of	 many	 other	 conditions.	 For
example,	one	must	often	actively	inquire	what	is
going	on	outside	therapy	hours.	The	fact	that	the
therapist	 is	 interested	 in	 the	 patient’s	 real
everyday	life,	although	it	can	be	viewed	as	a	form
of	 gratification,	 also	 constitutes	 a	 form	 of	 limit
setting.	In	general,	the	therapist	must	have	a	great
deal	of	flexibility	to	work	with	borderline	patients
and	 must	 learn	 to	 suit	 the	 treatment	 to	 each
patient,	not	each	patient	to	the	treatment.	Careful
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
160
listening	often	tells	us	what	a	patient	needs	in	the
way	 of	 treatment	 and	 what	 a	 patient	 can	 and
cannot	tolerate.	If	we	follow	this,	we	will	have	as
smooth	 and	 workable	 a	 relationship	 as	 possible
and	also	demonstrate	that	we	have	some	empathy
with	that	patient’s	fears	and	anxieties.
It	 is	 extremely	 important	 for	 the	 structure	 of
the	treatment	to	be	flexible	and	reasonable;	above
all,	 it	 has	 to	 make	 sense	 to	 the	 patient.	 If
borderline	patients	can	even	vaguely	understand
the	 reason	 for	 the	 structure	 and	 the	 limitations,
although	
they	
may	
still	
fight	
against	
the
framework	 of	 the	 treatment	 they	 will	 not	 be
basically	 impeded	 by	 it.	 Such	 patients	 do	 very
badly	 if	 structure	 is	 simply	 imposed	 on	 them	 by
fiat	 without	 discussion	 and	 if	 the	 therapist	 is
unwilling	to	negotiate.
The	 first	 pitfall	 in	 dealing	 with	 the	 archaic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
161
transferences	(see	ARCHAIC	TRANSFERENCES)	of
these	 patients	 is	 the	 danger	 of	 the	 therapist’s
panic.	 Flamboyant	 acting	 out	 often	 stirs	 up
countertransference	hatred	manifested	by	fears	of
patient	suicide	or	malpractice	litigation.	It	looks	as
if	the	patient	is	exploding,	and	unless	the	therapist
has	a	dynamic	grasp	of	what	is	going	on,	he	or	she
can	be	stampeded	into	doing	something	radical	or
into	getting	rid	of	the	patient.
The	second	pitfall	is	therapist	impatience.	The
therapist	 must	 be	 willing	 to	 sit	 sometimes	 for
years	 with	 a	 borderline	 patient	 while	 he	 or	 she
gradually	catalyzes	the	rebuilding	of	ego	structure.
Many	therapists	simply	don’t	want	to	do	this,	as	it
is	stressful,	tedious,	and	painstaking	work	that	can
be	 ungratifying	 for	 long	 periods	 of	 time.
Borderline	 patients	 tend	 to	 set	 up	 in	 external
reality	 the	 kinds	 of	 situations	 they	 need	 to	 have
occurring.	Sometimes	they	are	quite	expert	at	this,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
162
and	the	therapist	gets	sucked	into	playing	various
kinds	 of	 roles,	 depending	 on	 the	 projection
assigned	 to	 the	 therapist.	 This	 leads	 to	 serious
chronic	countertransference	problems.
When	 the	 raging	 begins,	 it	 is	 usually
impossible	to	argue	a	borderline	patient	out	of	his
or	 her	 accusations.	 If	 on	 careful	 objective
assessment	 it	 turns	 out	 that	 the	 accusations	 are
correct—and	 this	 sometimes	 happens—then	 the
therapist	 needs	 to	 self-correct	 and	 sometimes
apologize.	 If	 the	 accusations	 are	 based	 on
distortions	or	projection,	the	proper	approach	to
this	is	a	calm,	nonanxious,	patient,	nonretaliatory
stance,	 with	 eventual	 interpretation	 of	 what	 is
happening.	 It	 is	 this	 consistent	 stance	 that
provides	the	basic	ambience	of	the	treatment.	Any
disruption	of	it	interrupts	the	subliminal	soothing
that	 is	 always	 going	 on	 in	 a	 well-conducted
treatment	of	a	borderline	patient.	No	matter	how
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
163
much	the	therapist	may	wish	to	get	away	from	this
in	his	or	her	theoretical	conceptions,	the	ambience
or	 subliminal	 soothing	 the	 therapist	 provides
coming	from	consistency,	reliability,	and	integrity
—the	 ambience	 of	 the	 therapist’s	 office;	 the
therapist’s	 personality;	 the	 deep	 inner	 attitude
toward	 patients	 that	 cannot	 be	 faked—supports
the	basic	motor	that	permits	the	psychotherapy	of
the	borderline	to	go	forward.
Sometimes	the	rage	of	a	borderline	patient	is
stirred	 up	 directly	 by	 frustration	 of	 the	 need	 for
omnipotent	control	of	everything;	sometimes	the
rage	 is	 a	 secondary	 phenomenon	 to	 paranoid
projection	 or	 an	 intense	 transference.	 In	 a	 sense
such	 patients	 are	 correct	 when	 they	 predict	 that
all	 human	 relationships	 will	 end	 up	 badly	 for
them,	 with	 disappointment	 and	 dislike	 coming
from	
everyone	
around	
them.	
Elsewhere	
I
(Chessick	
1972)	
have	
discussed	
this	
as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
164
externalization	in	the	borderline	patient.	A	patient
responds	 selectively	 to	 the	 negative	 aspects	 of
significant	 people	 and	 develops	 a	 case	 or	 dossier
based	 on	 selective	 negative	 perceptions	 for
expecting	 attack	 from	 all	 sides—which	 then
justifies	
a	
preemptive	
strike.	
The	
chronic
calculated	attacks	on	the	therapist’s	defects,	if	not
interpreted,	can	easily	lead	to	countertransference
acting	out	on	the	part	of	the	therapist,	even	to	the
point	 of	 directly	 or	 indirectly	 getting	 rid	 of	 the
patient.	 This	 is	 quickly	 used	 as	 “proof’	 by	 the
patient	 of	 his	 or	 her	 expectation	 of	 apparently
unprovoked	betrayal	and	abandonment.
Psychotherapists	
of	
borderline	
patients
painfully	 experience	 the	 intensity	 of	 a	 patient’s
effort	 to	 manipulate	 them	 into	 validating	 his	 or
her	 projections.	 The	 therapists	 feel	 the	 inner
conflict	as	they	struggle	against	this	manipulation.
The	 most	 benign	 therapist	 approaching	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
165
borderline	patient	in	a	raging	archaic	transference
finds	 himself	 or	 herself	 transformed	 into	 a
horrible	 monster	 very	 quickly	 by	 the	 patient’s
selective	perception.	Unless	the	therapist	is	aware
of	this	danger,	the	tendency	is	either	to	retaliate	or
to	
quarrel	
with	
the	
patient’s	
extremely
unflattering	portrayal.	This	sudden	transformation
of	the	therapist	into	a	horrible	monster	can	occur
at	 any	 time	 in	 the	 treatment,	 even	 when	 there
seems	to	be	a	good	working	alliance.	It	often	leads
to	 therapist	 discouragement	 and	 burnout,	 with	 a
lingering	 sense	 of	 depression	 and	 injured	 self-
esteem.
The	clinical	phenomena	must	be	studied	to	see
what	 the	 therapist	 is	 actually	 doing	 with	 the
patient	regardless	of	the	theoretical	model	that	the
therapist	 professes	 to	 follow.	 For	 example,	 the
technique	 of	 Kohut	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY),	 in
which	the	idealization	of	the	therapist	is	permitted
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
166
over	 a	 long	 period	 of	 time	 so	 that	 the	 full
transference	involving	the	search	for	the	idealized
parent	imago	is	permitted	to	develop,	can	easily	be
used	by	an	untrained	or	untreated	therapist	as	an
excuse	to	permit	a	flattering	kind	of	worship	and
massage	
the	
narcissism	
of	
the	
therapist.
Conversely,	 the	 technique	 of	 Kernberg,	 in	 which
more	 confrontation	 goes	 on,	 can	 be	 used	 by	 the
therapist	 to	 act	 out	 hostility	 and	 aggressiveness
and	 to	 produce	 chaos,	 or	 even	 a	 sort	 of
counterprojective	identification.
Meticulous	 attention	 to	 the	 details	 of	 the
interaction	 is	 the	 best	 starting	 point	 in	 dealing
with	patients	who	are	subject	to	explosions	of	rage
in	 the	 treatment.	 What	 is	 important	 is	 not	 the
therapist’s	minor	empathic	failures	per	se,	but	the
way	in	which	they	are	experienced	by	the	patient.
The	patient	uses	these	minor	empathic	failures	to
relive	 a	 dreadful	 interpersonal	 experience	 in	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
167
protective	effort	to	further	demonstrate	the	need
for	distancing	in	interpersonal	relationships.	What
the	 therapist	 should	 be	 listening	 for	 in	 the
psychotherapy	is	how	the	patient	is	experiencing
the	 interaction	 with	 the	 therapist	 and	 in	 what
context	these	experiences	are	being	placed	within
the	 patient’s	 preexisting	 patterns.	 It	 is	 only	 after
the	 therapist	 has	 been	 able	 to	 establish	 this
information	 with	 the	 patient	 that	 he	 or	 she	 can
begin	asking	why	these	experiences	are	placed	in	a
particular	context.
The	most	common	fantasies	the	therapist	may
see	 emerging	 from	 the	 unconscious	 of	 the
borderline	 patient	 are	 not	 oedipal	 fantasies	 but
narcissistic	fantasies	and	fantasies	of	rage	and	of
world	 and	 self-destruction.	 The	 acting	 out	 of
conscious	 derivatives	 of	 such	 rage	 and	 of	 world
and	self-destruction	fantasies	endangers	the	very
life	 of	 the	 patient;	 the	 acting	 out	 of	 disavowed
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
168
narcissistic	 fantasies	 often	 renders	 the	 patient
poorly	 adapted	 and	 causes	 great	 difficulties	 in
interpersonal	relationships.
At	 the	 deepest	 point	 of	 the	 treatment	 these
core	narcissistic	and	destructive	fantasies	emerge
and	are	worked	through,	not	by	giving	the	patient
a	metapsychological	explanation,	but	by	allowing
such	 fantasies	 to	 emerge	 into	 the	 light,	 studying
their	 genesis,	 and	 showing	 the	 patient	 how	 the
acting	 out	 of	 such	 fantasies	 interferes	 with	 aims
and	goals	in	life.	The	borderline	disorder	is	similar
to	 the	 narcissistic	 disorder	 in	 that	 narcissistic
transferences	 and	 fantasies	 often	 appear,	 but	 is
different	from	the	narcissistic	personality	disorder
in	 that	 the	 intensity	 of	 the	 raging,	 fear,	 mistrust,
and	annihilation	fantasies	is	much	greater.

BOREDOM
It	may	surprise	the	psychotherapist	to	find	the
term	 “boredom”	 listed	 in	 a	 dictionary	 for
psychotherapists,	 but	 actually	 it	 is	 an	 important
form	 of	 countertransference.	 When	 the	 therapist
finds	himself	or	herself	“bored”	with	the	patient’s
hour	 or	 the	 patient’s	 material,	 it	 means	 that
something	 has	 gone	 wrong.	 Kleinians	 tend	 to
interpret	 therapist	 boredom	 as	 the	 result	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
170
negative	 projective	 identification,	 in	 which	 they
view	the	patient	as	projecting	in	such	a	way	as	to
interfere	 with	 the	 therapist’s	 mental	 processes,
reduce	the	material	to	meaningless,	and	produce	a
vacuous	 interpersonal	 field.	 All	 psychotherapists
have	had	the	experience	of	boredom	with	certain
types	 of	 patients	 or	 with	 certain	 patients	 when
they	 produce	 certain	 types	 of	 material,	 and	 as	 a
function	 of	 how	 a	 particular	 patient	 expresses
himself	 or	 herself.	 The	 danger	 of	 interpreting
boredom	 as	 a	 function	 of	 a	 patient’s	 negative
projective	identification	is	that	it	tends	to	put	the
blame	for	the	situation	on	the	patient.
Whenever	I	sense	countertransference,	I	try	to
look	 at	 myself	 first	 (see	 Chessick	 1990).	 When	 I
feel	 bored	 with	 a	 patient,	 I	 usually	 am	 not
understanding	 the	 patient’s	 material,	 not	 as	 a
result	 of	 the	 process	 of	 negative	 projective
identification,	but	because	the	patient	is	arousing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
171
anxiety	 or	 hostility	 in	 me,	 or	 because	 some
extraneous	matter	is	distracting	my	attention.	Self-
analysis	of	boredom	often	reveals	that	underneath
it	is	a	state	of	instinctual	tension	(Fenichel	1954).
As	nicely	summarized	by	Moore	and	Fine	(1990),
“Boredom	has	been	interpreted	as	arising	from	a
defensive	 struggle	 against	 unacceptable	 fantasies
and	 impulses	 in	 which	 the	 ideational	 content	 of
the	impulse	is	repressed	but	the	tension	achieves
affective	representation”	(p.	35).	I	suggest	that	the
psychotherapist	 apply	 this	 to	 himself	 or	 herself
when	feeling	bored	with	a	patient.
The	 converse	 is	 true	 when	 the	 patient
quizzically	inquires	as	to	whether	the	therapist	is
bored	 by	 him	 or	 her.	 When	 a	 patient	 speaks	 of
“boring”	the	therapist,	the	therapist	should	keep	in
mind	the	double	meaning	of	the	term.	In	Samuel
Johnson’s	(1773)	dictionary,	the	usage	of	the	term
“bore”	 is	 exclusively	 related	 to	 an	 aggressive

The	 origin	 of	 this	 term	 is	 from	 the	 classical
Greek,	 the	 words	 βοús	 (bous),	 meaning	 ox,	 and
λιμós	 (limos),	 meaning	 hunger.	 Thus,	 the	 person
with	what	Samuel	Johnson	(1773)	calls	bulimy	has
an	enormous	appetite,	which	Johnson	considered
to	be	often	attended	with	fainting	and	coldness	of
the	extremities.	The	problem	of	bulimia	nervosa,
as	 it	 is	 called,	 which	 is	 a	 variant	 of	 anorexia
nervosa	characterized	by	self-induced	vomiting	or
purging	following	binge	eating,	is	an	increasingly
common	
clinical	
picture	
encountered	
by
psychotherapists.	During	the	eating	binges	a	large
amount	 of	 food	 is	 ingested	 in	 a	 short	 period	 of
time.	 This	 is	 usually	 followed	 by	 a	 depressed
mood,	self-criticism,	and	self-induced	vomiting	or
purging.	 Sometimes	 the	 patient	 uses	 dangerous
chemicals	 like	 ipecac	 to	 induce	 vomiting	 or
destructive	 laxatives	 to	 induce	 purging.	 Between
BULIMIA,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
174
binges	 the	 patient	 is	 often	 anorexic,	 on	 a	 strict
diet,	and	preoccupied	with	exercise	to	the	point	of
a	 pathological	 obsession.	 This	 condition	 may	 be
accompanied	by	stealing,	sexual	promiscuity,	and
stormy	 interpersonal	 relationships,	 in	 contrast
with	 the	 classical	 anorexia	 nervosa,	 which	 is
usually	found	in	a	more	withdrawn	individual.
The	 psychological	 link	 underlying	 the	 whole
spectrum	
of	
the	
eating	
disorders	
from
superobesity	 to	 anorexia	 is	 stressed	 by	 Wooley
and	 Wooley	 (1980)	 and	 many	 other	 authors.
Shainess	 (1979)	 vividly	 describes	 that	 link	 in
psychoanalytic	 terms:	 “I	 feel	 convinced	 that	 the
unconscious	 fantasies	 connected	 with	 food	 are
that	 it	 is	 poison.	 The	 patient	 is	 trapped	 between
the	 need	 to	 eat	 and	 to	 sustain	 life,	 and	 the
paranoid	 projection	 in	 relation	 to	 food.	 …	 the
anorexic	feels	full	after	a	few	bites,	while	the	obese
always	has	room	for	more,	no	matter	how	much
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
175
has	been	eaten”	(pp.	230-231).	The	efforts	not	to
eat	are	seen	as	a	phobic	avoidance	of	poison,	while
overeating	represents	the	need	to	retain	food-as-
mother,	says	Shainess.	One	obese	patient	of	mine
regularly	 referred	 to	 binge	 eating	 of	 bags	 of
cookies	 as	 eating	 “bags	 of	 garbage,”	 and	 clearly
distinguished	 this	 from	 her	 ordinary	 and	 normal
eating	pattern.
In	 all	 the	 cases,	 the	 whole	 eating	 pattern	 is
disorganized,	 and	 the	 relationship	 of	 child	 to
mother	is	acted	out	over	food.	The	dramatic	eating
disorder,	whether	through	“alimentary	orgasms,”
masochistic	
infliction	
of	
self-starvation	
or
unpleasant	 compulsive	 stuffing,	 or	 the	 binge-
purge	 guilt	 and	 restitution	 circle,	 drains	 off	 the
rage	and	paranoia	(more	or	less)	and	focuses	the
patient’s	attention	away	from	the	empty,	depleted
self	and	onto	preoccupation	with	gastrointestinal-
tract	 sensations.	 In	 this	 manner,	 some	 sort	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
176
sense	of	being	alive	is	maintained.	So	on	top	of	the
depleted	and	fragmented	nuclear	core,	the	patient
has	 built	 various	 protective	 rituals	 and	 soothing
activities,	 which,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 eating
disorders,	 sometimes	 permit	 the	 patient	 to
function	in	society.
At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 patient	 must	 deal	 with
the	 massive	 narcissistic	 rage	 or	 unconscious
sadism.	 For	 example,	 Offenkrantz	 and	 Tobin
(1974)	 discuss	 such	 a	 patient	 as	 a	 “depressive
character”	 and	 emphasize	 the	 great	 unconscious
rage	 at	 important	 objects	 who	 are	 not	 providing
the	 patient	 with	 what	 he	 or	 she	 unconsciously
needs—a	 rage	 that	 often	 gets	 turned	 on	 the
therapist.	 Under	 this	 lies	 an	 anaclitic	 depression
characterized	 by	 depletion	 and	 a	 hopelessness
that	sufficient	gratification	will	ever	be	possible.
The	 classical	 psychodynamics	 of	 anorexia	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
177
young	 women	 have	 long	 been	 known	 to	 include
the	 impairment	 of	 development	 arising	 from	 an
early	 unsuccessful	 mother-daughter	 relationship.
The	
adolescent	
girl,	
faced	
with	
feminine
individuation	 and	 threatened	 by	 the	 loss	 of
dependency	on	the	family,	responds	to	the	conflict
in	 these	 cases	 by	 regression	 to	 an	 infantile
maternal	 relationship	 with	 unconscious	 craving
for	 blissful	 eating	 experiences.	 This	 is	 denied	 in
the	 drama	 that	 is	 carried	 out	 by	 an	 oscillation
between	eating	and	severe	dieting;	the	pursuit	of
thinness	 usually	 represents	 an	 act	 of	 hostile	 and
defiant	 compliance	 by	 the	 patient	 against	 the
mother.
It	 is	 clear	 from	 clinical	 experience	 that	 the
eating	
disorders	
protect	
the	
patient	
from
unbearable	 affects,	 which	 then	 do	 appear	 if	 the
eating	 disorder	 is	 stopped.	 It	 is	 the	 extremely
negative	self-image	and	self-hatred—or	in	Kohut’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
178
terms,	 the	 depleted	 self	 with	 the	 disintegration
product	 of	 narcissistic	 rage—that	 precede	 the
development	
of	
the	
eating	
disorder.	
This
intrapsychic	
psychopathology	
forms	
the
foundation	for	the	various	eating	disorders,	which
then	
develop	
when	
the	
tension	
becomes
unbearable,	 the	 faulty	 preoedipal	 self-soothing
system	 becomes	 overwhelmed,	 and	 the	 self
threatens	to	fragment	or	actually	does	so.
In	 my	 clinical	 experience	 the	 most	 serious
problem	 in	 the	 intensive	 psychotherapy	 of	 an
eating	disorder	is	not	that	of	a	schizophrenic	loss
of	reality	testing,	as	Bruch	(1973)	suggests,	but	of
a	deep	characterologic	depression	often	with	core
paranoid	 features—manifested	 by	 a	 derogatory
self-image,	
cynicism,	
and	
hopelessness	
and
reinforced	 by	 the	 long-standing	 nature	 of	 the
condition—as	well	as	a	profound	narcissistic	rage
that	 begins	 to	 show	 itself	 as	 the	 eating	 disorder
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
179
itself	 is	 corrected.	 Thus	 a	 long	 and	 difficult
intensive	psychotherapy	is	to	be	expected	because
we	 are	 dealing	 with	 a	 profound	 preoedipal
disorder	characterized	by	severe	early	structural
defects.

CANNIBALISTIC
The	
term	
“cannibalistic”	
was	
given	
to
Abraham’s	
(1954)	
second	
oral	
stage	
of
development,	the	so-called	oral-sadistic	stage.	It	is
used	by	analogy	with	cannibalism	and	represents
fantasies	 supposed	 to	 occur	 with	 active	 oral
incorporation.	 The	 connotation	 is	 that	 of	 the
hostile,	 sadistic	 aspects	 of	 oral	 introjection	 or
incorporation.	 This	 term	 is	 used	 very	 loosely	 in
the	 literature	 and	 has	 tended	 to	 fall	 out	 of	 favor
because	it	speculates	about	the	kinds	of	fantasies
infants	 have	 when	 introjection	 or	 incorporation
goes	 on,	 and	 it	 draws	 a	 questionable	 analogy
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
181
between	 the	 literal	 cannibalistic	 behavior	 of
certain	primitive	peoples	and	the	alleged	fantasies
in	the	mind	of	an	infant.

CASTRATION	ANXIETY
This	 well-known	 aspect	 of	 Freud’s	 theory	 of
sexuality	 pertains	 especially	 to	 his	 view’	 that	 all
men	and	male	children	are	liable	to	anxiety	over
the	possibility	of	their	castration.	It	refers	usually
not	to	castration	in	its	literal	sense	but	to	the	fear
of	the	loss	of	the	penis	or,	at	a	more	general	level,
to	the	loss	of	the	masculine	role.
Women,	
of	
course,	
cannot	
suffer	
from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
182
castration	 anxiety	 in	 this	 sense,	 but	 classical
theory	assumes	they	have	a	“castration	complex,”
referring	 to	 their	 sense	 of	 being	 “castrated”	 and
lacking	 in	 a	 fundamental	 part	 (see	 FEMALE
PSYCHOLOGY).	The	awareness	of	this	lack,	which
occurs	when	a	little	girl	first	observes	a	penis,	is
sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 “castration	 shock”	 and
was	 believed	 by	 Freud	 (1925)	 to	 cause	 the	 little
girl	to	enter	into	the	Oedipus	complex.	To	say	the
least,	the	issue	of	whether	the	lack	of	a	penis	per
se	 is	 a	 central	 one	 in	 the	 developmental
psychology	 of	 women	 is	 highly	 debatable.
Certainly	 Freud	 (1923,	 1925)	 was	 wrong	 in	 his
devaluation	
of	
the	
importance	
of	
vaginal
sensations	 in	 prepubertal	 girls;	 at	 times	 he	 did
seem	 to	 recognize	 the	 importance	 of	 social	 and
cultural	 factors	 in	 so-called	 penis	 envy,	 which
refers	more	to	the	oppressed	status	of	women	in
our	 culture	 than	 to	 their	 actual	 lack	 of	 a	 bodily
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
183
organ.
Freud	thought	the	little	boy’s	basic	fear	was	of
being	 castrated	 by	 his	 father,	 but	 Melanie	 Klein
(1932)	 believed	 there	 was	 a	 forerunner	 of
castration	 anxiety	 based	 on	 sadistic	 pregenital
phases.	At	any	rate,	castration	anxiety	represents
an	 important	 part	 of	 oedipal	 fantasies	 and
together	with	the	associated	emotions	constitutes
what	is	known	as	the	“castration	complex.”
In	psychotherapeutic	work	it	should	be	kept	in
mind	 that	 castration	 anxiety	 can	 be	 precipitated
by	 everyday	 events	 that	 may	 have	 the	 same
significance,	 such	 as	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 job,	 loss	 of	 a
tooth,	
or	
even	
humiliating	
experiences	
or
situations	 where	 a	 man	 has	 not	 acted	 in	 a	 way
socially	 determined	 to	 be	 masculine	 and	 is
ridiculed	for	this	fact.	The	problem	of	a	castration
complex	carries	with	it	an	early	fantasy	process	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
184
the	child	that	arises	out	of	the	child’s	puzzlement
over	the	anatomical	difference	between	the	sexes.
In	 psychoanalytic	 work	 it	 is	 crucial	 to	 try	 to
uncover	 these	 early	 fantasy	 processes	 because
they	often	have	a	decisive	effect	on	the	later	life	of
the	patient.
Understanding	 the	 psychology	 of	 women
hinges	on	one’s	opinions	about	the	importance	of
their	castration	complex	and	the	significance	of	it
in	determining	their	behavior	as	a	way	of	denying
or	 overcoming	 their	 sense	 of	 castration	 (see
FEMALE	 PSYCHOLOGY).	 The	 so-called	 masculine
protest	 of	 Adler	 was	 a	 way	 of	 describing	 the
woman’s	 refusal	 to	 accept	 the	 feminine	 role	 and
the	 sense	 of	 castration;	 Freud	 considered	 such	 a
refusal	 to	 lead	 to	 psychopathology.	 I	 believe	 any
efforts	to	explain	away	the	behavior	of	a	woman
on	 the	 basis	 of	 such	 speculation	 to	 be	 both
demeaning	and	misleading	unless	the	analyst	can
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
185
demonstrate,	 after	 a	 study	 over	 years	 of	 time	 of
the	unfolding	of	the	patient’s	transference,	that	the
early	 fantasy	 process	 of	 the	 specific	 woman
patient	involved	did	indeed	manifest	a	castration
complex.	 There	 are	 some	 cases	 in	 which	 this
seems	 to	 be	 evident,	 but	 the	 danger	 of
misinterpreting	 the	 striving	 of	 any	 oppressed
group	for	justice	and	equality	on	the	basis	of	wild
psychoanalysis	 should	 always	 be	 kept	 in	 mind;
psychotherapy	 and	 psychoanalysis	 should	 never
be	allowed	to	be	used	as	a	tool	for	oppression	or	to
force	adaptation	to	a	pathological	culture.

CATHEXIS
This	 imprecise	 term	 was	 coined	 by	 Freud
when	 he	 was	 thinking	 of	 quanta	 of	 energy
attached	to	certain	ideation;	it	is	used	less	and	less
in	 the	 literature,	 since	 the	 tendency	 is	 to	 move
away	 from	 Freud’s	 hydrodynamic	 model	 of
metapsychology.	
Cathexis	
represents	
the
conscious	or	unconscious	attachment	of	emotional
feeling	 and	 significance	 to	 an	 idea	 or	 person.
Laplanche	 and	 Pontalis	 (1973)	 tell	 us	 that
“cathexis”	is	the	rendering	of	Freud’s	Besetzung	by
James	Strachey	in	1922	using	the
Greek	 word	 κατεχειν	 (katechein),	 meaning	 to
occupy	or	hold	fast.	Freud	did	not	like	this	choice.
A	typical	use	of	Besetzung	in	German	is	to	denote
the	 occupation	 by	 a	 military	 force	 of	 a	 town	 or
territory;	but	there	are	many	connotations	of	the
term,	 and	 some	 authors	 (Cheshire	 and	 Thoma
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
187
1991)	argue	it	should	remain	untranslated.
Although	it	is	technically	difficult	to	defend,	in
clinical	practice	we	do	see	phenomena	that	can	be
conceptualized	 as	 the	 cathexis	 of	 the	 ego,	 the
cathexis	 of	 certain	 fantasies	 or	 wishes,	 and	 the
cathexis	of	objects—	with	a	consequent	shifting	of
libidinal	 and	 aggressive	 energies	 as	 cathexis	 is
bound	or	unbound	during	the	therapeutic	process.
It	 is	 this	 common	 clinical	 phenomena	 that	 Freud
was	 trying	 to	 articulate	 when	 he	 used	 the	 term
Besetzung,	 perhaps	 having	 in	 mind	 military
occupation	or	the	removal	of	troops	from	various
positions.	Decathexis	would	be	the	withdrawal	of
cathexis.	Anticathexis	or	countercathexis	would	be
energy	 used	 in	 a	 conflict	 against	 the	 originally
cathected	 ego,	 fantasy,	 or	 object.	 This	 kind	 of
description	is	known	as	the	“economic”	viewpoint,
and	 is	 not	 much	 favored	 today,	 although	 as	 a
metaphor	I	think	it	has	clinical	value.

CENSOR
The	 “censor”	 was	 one	 of	 Freud’s	 early
formulations	 before	 the	 structural	 theory	 and
labels	 the	 mental	 agency	 responsible	 for	 dream
distortion	and	repression	in	his	early	topographic
formulations.	 I	 include	 it	 here	 because	 it	 is
sometimes	 forgotten	 that	 there	 are	 not	 one	 but
two	censors	in	topographic	theory.	One	censor	is
between	 the	 unconscious	 and	 preconscious	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
189
another	
is	
between	
the	
preconscious	
and
conscious.	 In	 our	 therapeutic	 work	 we	 deal
primarily	
with	
the	
censor	
between	
the
preconscious	 and	 the	 conscious.	 As	 preconscious
material	 is	 allowed	 into	 the	 conscious	 by	 the
second	 censor,	 earlier	 derivatives	 are	 allowed
from	the	unconscious	into	the	preconscious	by	the
first.	 These	 concepts	 have	 been	 replaced	 by	 the
structural	 theory,	 in	 which	 censorship	 has	 been
relegated	as	one	of	the	ego	functions.
For	 example,	 Ranged	 (1989)	 has	 emphasized
the	 ego	 function	 of	 unconscious	 choice	 and
decision	 about	 what	 material	 to	 allow	 into	 the
conscious.	The	ego	unconsciously	evaluates,	plans,
and	 executes	 action,	 in	 his	 view.	 Sartre	 (1973)
opposes	 the	 entire	 notion	 of	 a	 “censor”	 as	 “bad
faith.”	 (For	 details,	 see	 Chessick	 1984,	 1985.)
One’s	 theoretical	 decision	 on	 this	 matter	 will
greatly	affect	how	one	conducts	psychotherapy.

CHARACTER
“Character”	 is	 defined	 by	 Samuel	 Johnson
(1773)	as	“a	mark;	a	stamp;	a	representation”	(p.
300).	 That	 is	 to	 say,	 it	 is	 a	 descriptive	 term	 that
represents	 the	 sum	 of	 the	 consistently	 displayed
personality	traits	and	habitual	modes	of	response
an	 individual	 uses.	 A	 character	 defense	 would
involve	
personality	
traits	
that	
serve	
an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
191
unconscious	
defensive	
purpose.	
A	
“defense
transference”	
represents	
the	
personality
characteristics	 presented	 by	 the	 patient	 at	 the
beginning	of	treatment	that	are	used	typically	by
that	 patient	 to	 defend	 himself	 or	 herself	 against
the	 pressure	 of	 unconscious	 drives	 potentially
aimed	at	the	analyst	and	that	will	emerge	later	in
the	 treatment	 as	 the	 defense	 transference	 drops
away.
The	 features	 of	 a	 personality	 or	 character
disorder	 and	 the	 current	 official	 nosology	 are
discussed	 in	 DSM-III-R	 and	 will	 not	 be	 reviewed
here.	It	is	a	judgmental	diagnosis	implying	that	the
patient’s	 habitual	 patterns	 of	 reaction	 are
maladaptive	and	limiting,	often	provoking	the	very
responses	from	the	people	around	that	the	patient
was	most	concerned	to	avoid.	Character	traits	are
typically	 ego	 syntonic	 in	 contrast	 to	 neurotic
symptoms,	which	are	ego	dystonic.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
192
The	 old	 term	 “character	 neurosis”	 denoted	 a
situation	 in	 which	 the	 neurosis	 manifested	 itself
by	character	traits	rather	than	neurotic	symptoms,
but	this	term	has	not	achieved	general	acceptance.
I	 think	 one	 of	 the	 reasons	 for	 this	 is	 that	 a
character	 neurosis	 was	 thought	 to	 be	 based
primarily	 on	 an	 infantile	 Oedipus	 complex,
whereas	
most	
thinking	
about	
personality
disorders	
today	
emphasizes	
the	
preoedipal
features	 in	 their	 formation.	 The	 concept	 of
personality	 disorder	 is	 fundamentally	 a	 social
diagnosis	made	by	people	other	than	the	patient,
and	 a	 variety	 of	 classifications	 of	 character
disorders	or	personality	disorders	have	appeared
in	the	literature.
One’s	 personality	 or	 character	 must	 be
understood	as	a	“readout”	displaying	compromise
formations	made	by	the	ego	between	the	demands
of	 the	 id,	 the	 superego,	 and	 external	 reality.	 So
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
193
character	traits	are	a	mixture	of	drive	derivatives,
defenses,	and	superego	components.	They	may	be
thought	 of	 as	 developing	 over	 time	 out	 of	 the
attempt	 to	 resolve	 intrapsychic	 conflict.	 There	 is
also	a	growing	body	of	evidence	that	genetic	and
constitutional	 factors	 play	 an	 important	 role	 as
supplying	potentials	that	may	or	may	not	be	used
by	each	individual	in	the	development	of	character
traits.	 Although	 the	 classic	 papers	 on	 the
formation	of	character	are	by	Freud	(1908,	1916),
there	 is	 general	 agreement	 that	 his	 formulations
represent	 to	 some	 extent	 an	 oversimplification.
The	therapist	should	avoid	the	“wild	analysis”	of
character	 traits	 by	 reference	 to	 the	 various
libidinal	
stages	
of	
development;	
such
interpretations	 are	 the	 mark	 of	 an	 amateur	 (see
WILD	PSYCHOANALYSIS).

COMPLEMENTAL	SERIES
Freud	develops	the	clinically	important	notion
of	 complemental	 series.	 He	 begins	 by	 asking
whether	 neuroses	 are	 exogenous	 or	 endogenous
illnesses;	that	is,	are	they	the	inevitable	result	of	a
particular	 constitution,	 or	 the	 product	 of	 certain
detrimental	 or	 traumatic	 experiences	 in	 life?
Freud	 maintains	 that	 a	 series	 of	 cases	 could	 be
presented	that	vary	in	the	amount	of	each	of	these
factors,	 so	 that	 in	 some,	 constitutional	 factors
seem	 overwhelmingly	 important,	 while	 in	 others
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
195
the	 detrimental	 experiences	 seem	 to	 be	 the
primary	 determinant	 of	 the	 formation	 of	 the
neuroses.	This	notion	was	originally	presented	as
the	 “etiological	 equation”	 in	 Freud’s	 earliest
works.	 However,	 in	 Introductory	 Lectures	 on
Psychoanalysis	 (1916)	 it	 is	 discussed	 at	 some
length,	 and	 several	 examples	 of	 complemental
series	are	offered.
In	addition	to	the	complemental	series	formed
by	 cases	 involving	 constitutional	 or	 biological
factors	 on	 the	 one	 hand,	 and	 detrimental	 or
traumatic	 experiences	 on	 the	 other,	 we	 have	 a
series	formed	of	those	cases	in	which	the	intensity
and	
pathogenic	
importance	
of	
infantile
experiences	 are	 primary,	 and	 of	 those	 cases	 in
which	later	adult	experiences	of	an	overwhelming
destructive	nature	are	clearly	the	major	factor	in
the	formation	of	the	neurosis.	Still	another	series
is	formed	by	those	cases	in	which	the	destructive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
196
events	 in	 infancy,	 such	 as	 parental	 seduction,
really	happened,	and	by	those	cases	based	on	the
psychic	fantasies	during	the	early	years	that	have
no	basis	in	fact.
The	
notion	
of	
complemental	
series	
is
extremely	useful	in	understanding	the	breadth	of
Freud’s	 view.	 For	 example,	 even	 the	 thorny
problem	 of	 the	 group	 of	 schizophrenias	 can	 be
explained	 as	 a	 complemental	 series	 of	 cases:	 in
some,	it	seems	clear	that	a	major	constitutional	or
biological	 factor	 is	 at	 work;	 in	 others,	 there	 is
ample	 evidence	 for	 profound	 detrimental	 and
environmental	 factors	 in	 childhood.	 Freud’s
viewpoint	 leaves	 room	 for	 all	 types	 of	 cases	 and
offers	a	neat	integration	of	the	psychological	and
the	 biological.	 Similarly,	 we	 know	 that	 any	 adult
can	 be	 broken	 down	 and	 forced	 into	 neurotic
symptomatology	 if	 sufficient	 psychic	 trauma	 is
applied;	 this	 unfortunate	 empirical	 information
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
197
fits	into	the	second	complemental	series	described
above.
Perhaps	 the	 most	 interesting	 is	 the	 third
complemental	 series,	 in	 which	 some	 neurotics
allow	the	psychic	reality	of	their	infantile	fantasies
to	 influence	 their	 entire	 lives.	 Freud	 does	 not
explain	 why	 this	 might	 be	 so,	 but	 it	 is	 perhaps
related	to	his	obsolete	concept	of	the	adhesiveness
of	the	libido	(see	ADHESIVENESS	OF	THE	LIBIDO),
which	 he	 defined	 as	 the	 tenacity	 with	 which	 the
libido	adheres	to	particular	trends	and	objects,	an
independent	 factor	 varying	 from	 individual	 to
individual.	 The	 causes	 of	 such	 adhesiveness	 are
unknown	 but	 probably	 represent	 a	 biological	 or
constitutional	factor.	Not	only	is	this	adhesiveness
of	the	libido	of	great	significance	in	understanding
the	 etiology	 of	 neuroses,	 but	 it	 is	 a	 factor
encountered	in	the	intensive	psychotherapy	of	all
disorders,	 since	 there	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 remarkable
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
198
variation	in	the	timetable	with	which	a	patient	can
work	 through	 and	 free	 up	 from	 certain	 infantile
positions	 and	 attachments.	 Awareness	 and	 an
understanding	of	the	individual	patient’s	timetable
is	 extremely	 important,	 for	 attempts	 to	 hurry
psychotherapy	 increase	 resistance	 and	 interfere
with	the	treatment.

COMPULSION	TO	REPEAT
This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 remarkable	 and
inexplicable	 tendencies	 of	 the	 human	 mind	 that
seems	to	show	itself	inevitably	in	psychoanalytic
treatment.	 It	 refers	 to	 the	 universal	 tendency	 of
individuals	 to	 repeat	 in	 their	 lives	 distressing	 or
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
199
even	painful	situations	without	realizing	they	are
doing	so,	or	even	understanding	they	are	bringing
about	 the	 recurrence	 and	 repeating	 in	 their
current	situation	the	worst	times	from	their	past.
This	has	been	attributed	to	some	kind	of	urge	to
mastery	(Hendrick	1948),	although	Freud	(1920)
attributed	 it	 to	 the	 death	 instinct.	 As	 a	 rule	 of
thumb	in	psychotherapy,	one	should	always	ask,	if
the	patient	is	involved	in	a	difficult	or	unpleasant
situation	either	outside	the	treatment	or	with	the
therapist,	what	is	being	repeated.
Transference	is	an	important	manifestation	of
the	 compulsion	 to	 repeat	 (see	 TRANSFERENCE).
Indeed,	 Freud’s	 (1914)	 early	 use	 of	 the	 concept
was	to	point	out	how	the	patient	repeats	behavior
with	 a	 doctor	 that	 was	 characteristic	 of	 earlier
experiences.	In	this	way,	repetition	can	be	thought
of	as	a	way	of	remembering.	Repetition	substitutes
for	 the	 articulation	 of	 forgotten	 memories;
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
200
therefore,	in	unraveling	the	compulsion	to	repeat,
one	should	end	up	with	early	memories	and	core
fantasies	 that	 have	 been	 long	 forgotten.	 This
extraordinary	process	of	the	compulsion	to	repeat
is	ungratifying,	and	Freud	(1920)	did	not	believe	it
could	 be	 explained	 by	 the	 pleasure	 principle;
hence	he	thought	it	was	stemming	from	“beyond
the	pleasure	principle.”

CONSCIOUSNESS
Samuel	Johnson	(1773)	defines	“conscious”	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
201
“endowed	with	the	power	of	knowing	one’s	own
thoughts	 and	 actions”	 (p.	 397).	 “Consciousness”
remains	one	of	the	most	difficult	and	controversial
of	 all	 the	 concepts	 discussed	 in	 this	 book.	 We
know	 that	 consciousness	 is	 a	 state	 that	 can	 be
contrasted	to	being	asleep	and	is	centered	on	self-
awareness,	allegedly	differentiating	humans	from
animals.	 Freud	 thought	 of	 consciousness	 as	 a
sense	 organ	 that	 could	 perceive	 internal	 mental
events	 and	 discriminate	 them	 from	 external
perceptions,	a	function	he	termed	reality	testing.
The	tendency	in	classical	psychoanalytic	work	has
been	to	minimize	the	importance	of	consciousness
and	 to	 assume	 that	 conscious	 phenomena	 are
derivatives	 or	 compromise	 formations	 stemming
from	 unconscious	 factors.	 This	 stands	 in	 sharp
contrast	 to	 the	 phenomenologic	 point	 of	 view,
which	attempts	to	approach	human	behavior	and
expression	by	meticulous	analysis	of	the	conscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
202
phenomena	 without	 making	 assumptions	 about
underlying	 processes.	 The	 emphasis	 or	 lack	 of
emphasis	 on	 conscious	 phenomena	 sharply
differentiates	 so-called	 existential	 psychiatry	 and
psychoanalysis	from	Freud’s	work.
In	 his	 topographical	 theory	 Freud	 depicted
consciousness	as	the	function	of	the	system	Pcpt.-
Cs.,	 which	 he	 thought	 of	 as	 lying	 on	 the
“periphery”	of	the	psychical	apparatus.	I	(Chessick
1980)	believe	that	Freud’s	(1950)	famous	“Project
for	 a	 Scientific	 Psychology”	 floundered	 on	 the
difficulty	 of	 explaining	 consciousness	 from	 his
neuronal	theory,	just	as	today	the	argument	over
consciousness	 is	 a	 crucial	 one	 in	 the	 field	 of
artificial	intelligence	and	poses	the	classical	mind-
brain	 problem	 in	 philosophy	 (McGinn	 1991;	 see
MIND).	 Freud	 believed	 that	 the	 system	 Pcpt.-Cs.
had	 free	 and	 mobile	 energy	 which	 could	 be
attached	to	certain	mental	contents—this	was	his
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
203
notion	 of	 attention	 and	 explained	 how	 the
preconscious	 became	 conscious.	 An	 evanescent
attention	cathexis	determines	what	is	conscious	at
any	 given	 time.	 Moore	 and	 Fine	 (1990)	 state,
“Consciousness	is	dependent	on	and	influenced	by
the	individual’s	present	situation	and	past	history,
including	 such	 factors	 as	 motivation,	 affect,
memory,	
and	
knowledge”	
(p.	
46).	
So
consciousness	 is	 a	 subjective	 experience,	 which
lends	 itself	 to	 the	 phenomenological	 approach
(Husserl	1913;	see	PHENOMENOLOGY).
Obviously	 consciousness	 may	 be	 altered	 by
various	factors	such	as	sleep,	organic	illness,	and
drugs.	 The	 DSM-III-R	 (American	 Psychiatric
Association	 1987)	 dissociative	 disorders	 often
present	with	an	altered	state	of	consciousness.

CONSCIOUSNESS	RAISING
Consciousness	 raising,	 the	 attempt	 to	 elevate
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
205
an	individual’s	awareness	of	himself	or	herself	and
to	 better	 recognize	 the	 individual’s	 needs	 and
special	 problems	 in	 the	 particular	 culture	 or
family	environment	in	which	he	or	she	dwells,	has
become	popular	these	days.	Although	it	is	a	central
function	 of	 various	 discussion	 groups,	 it	 may	 be
traced	 back	 to	 Marxist	 efforts	 to	 encourage	 class
consciousness	among	the	proletariat	as	a	prelude
to	 the	 anticipated	 revolutionary	 changes	 in
society.	 Even	 today	 consciousness	 raising	 is	 an
extremely	 important	 psychotherapeutic	 process,
although	 it	 is	 not	 primarily	 psychoanalytic	 in
nature.	Still,	I	doubt	if	it	is	possible	to	do	intensive
psychotherapy	 with	 a	 patient	 without	 some
consciousness	 raising	 taking	 place.	 Certainly
women	 become	 more	 aware	 of	 the	 kinds	 of
pressures	 on	 them	 in	 society	 and	 from	 their
families,	 and	 men	 become	 more	 aware	 of	 their
passive	and	receptive	needs.	Similarly,	if	there	are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
206
healthy	
developmental	
alterations	
in	
an
individual,	 that	 person	 may	 become	 more
conscious	of	the	needs	of	the	underprivileged	and
economically	disadvantaged	groups	in	society.
It	is	not	conceivable	to	me	how	the	therapist’s
preconceptions	 and	 value	 system	 can	 be	 kept
completely	opaque	to	a	patient	during	the	process
of	 intensive	 psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis,
regardless	 of	 what	 is	 thought	 of	 as	 the	 ideal
situation.	 One	 glance	 at	 any	 therapist’s	 office,
including	 Freud’s	 (Engelman	 1976),	 makes	 that
obvious.	 The	 apparent	 contrast,	 at	 least	 in	 some
areas,	 between	 the	 assumed	 healthy	 attitudes	 of
the	 properly	 psychoanalyzed	 therapist	 toward
various	 oppressed	 groups	 and	 on	 other	 subjects
such	 as	 the	 value	 of	 military	 operations,	 and	 on
those	assumptions	the	patient	has	simply	taken	in
from	 our	 violent	 culture	 constitutes	 a	 form	 of
consciousness	 raising,	 whether	 the	 therapist

CONSTRUCTION

CONVERSION
In	this	process	a	physical	symptom	replaces	an
unconscious	 psychic	 complex.	 It	 is	 a	 generally
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
208
unsatisfactory	
concept	
because	
it	
leaves
unexplained	 the	 so-called	 mysterious	 leap	 from
the	 mental	 to	 the	 physical.	 My	 approach	 to
conversion	 symptoms	 when	 they	 occur	 in
psychotherapy	or	are	the	presenting	symptoms	is
to	regard	them	as	substitutes	for	the	expression	of
compromise	 formations	 by	 the	 ego	 that	 might
otherwise	 be	 articulated	 in	 language.	 Conversion
symptoms,	 then,	 are	 a	 form	 of	 language,	 and	 by
uncovering	 the	 unconscious	 fantasy	 processes
underlying	the	conversion	symptoms	one	converts
them	into	articulated	language	(see	LACAN).
There	is	a	genetic	or	constitutional	propensity
to	 the	 formation	 of	 conversion	 symptoms.	 It	 is
often	 argued	 that	 conversion	 symptoms	 appear
more	 in	 rural	 and	 uneducated	 populations,	 but	 I
have	also	seen	them	in	some	highly	sophisticated
and	
educated	
metropolitan	
individuals.
Conversion	is	a	defense	mechanism	that	operates
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
209
unconsciously	 and	 removes	 anxiety	 that	 would
otherwise	 be	 present	 before	 the	 compromise
formation	 has	 taken	 place.	 For	 this	 reason,
patients	 with	 conversion	 symptoms	 often	 show
the	classical	belle	indifference.	The	symptoms	may
be	very	minor	or	extremely	dramatic,	and	almost
any	organ	system	can	be	involved.	The	tendency	is
for	 the	 striated	 musculature	 to	 be	 used	 in
conversion	symptoms,	but	cases	involving	smooth
musculature	 and	 even	 the	 cardiovascular	 system
are	reported.	The	treatment	for	such	patients	is	far
more	 difficult	 than	 was	 originally	 believed.
Although	 the	 symptoms	 may	 be	 temporarily
removed	 by	 hypnosis	 or	 narcosynthesis,	 other
symptoms	 soon	 take	 their	 place.	 Some	 of	 Breuer
and	 Freud’s	 (1893-1895)	 classical	 cases	 of
conversion	hysteria	were	probably	borderline	or
schizotypal	personality	disorders.

CORRUPTION
Psychoanalysts	
have	
not	
paid	
sufficient
attention	 to	 the	 development	 of	 corruption	 as	 it
manifests	itself	not	only	in	their	patients	and	their
societies	 but	 in	 themselves.	 Corruption	 as
discussed	here	is	not	the	inevitable	physical	decay
and	 death	 of	 body	 tissue.	 It	 is	 the	 corruption	 of
one’s	ego-ideals	under	the	vicissitudes	of	life.
Technically	 speaking,	 corruption	 represents
the	vicissitudes	of	the	progressive	withdrawal	of
narcissistic	 libido	 from	 cathexis	 of	 the	 ego-ideal
and	back	to	a	cathexis	of	the	ego	itself,	analogous
to	
Freud’s	
(1914)	
concept	
of	
secondary
narcissism,	
in	
which	
narcissistic	
libido	
is
withdrawn	 from	 objects	 and	 replaced	 in	 the	 ego
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
211
(see	NARCISSISM	 and	 LIBIDO).	 The	 cause	 of	 this
withdrawal,	 as	 in	 the	 situation	 of	 Freud’s
secondary	 narcissism,	 is	 progressive	 narcissistic
wounding	out	of	the	disappointments	encountered
in	 the	 vicissitudes	 of	 life	 and	 in	 an	 attempt	 to
prevent	further	pain.
The	 ego-ideal	 shrivels	 under	 the	 impact	 of
reality,	which	punishes	all	but	the	most	talented	or
lucky	individuals	for	their	attempts	to	live	up	to	it.
A	similar	phenomenon	accounts	for	the	decline	of
“Cultures”	into	“Civilizations”	and	then	into	chaos
and	 barbarism,	 as	 described	 by	 Spengler	 (1926,
1962).	 The	 ego-ideal	 of	 a	 culture	 is	 set	 by	 its
founders,	such	as	the	early	Greeks	or	the	American
colonists.
Spengler	 was	 not	 aware	 of	 the	 profound
significance	
of	
narcissistic	
wounding	
and
attributed	 the	 decline	 of	 cultures	 to	 an	 inherent
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
212
botanical	organicity,	borrowing	from	the	romantic
philosophy	 of	 Goethe.	 Hutchins	 (1968),	 who	 was
not	 psychoanalytically	 oriented	 (Ashmore	 1989)
described	 the	 corruption	 of	 an	 individual	 in
moralistic	and	Aristotelian	terminology.	But	when
the	 ego-ideal	 is	 divested	 of	 its	 narcissistic	 libido,
there	is	consequently	less	and	less	motivation	to
live	 up	 to	 it,	 since	 there	 is	 less	 and	 less
gratification	when	an	identification	with	the	ego-
ideal	has	been	achieved.
Spengler	(1962)	considered	the	“megapolis”	as
the	worst	feature	of	what	he	called	“Civilization,”	a
decadent	 phase	 of	 each	 “Culture.”	 He	 forecast
larger	and	larger	cities,	which	he	conceived	of	as
being	 laid	 out	 for	 20	 million	 inhabitants	 and
covering	 vast	 areas	 of	 the	 countryside.	 He	 gave
many	 examples	 of	 the	 development	 of	 these
megapolises	in	history	and	concluded	that	the	end
of	 all	 these	 cities	 was	 inevitably	 the	 same.	 After
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
213
the	 city,	 beginning	 as	 a	 primitive	 barter	 center,
develops	to	its	zenith	as	a	Culture	city—which	for
Spengler	 was	 the	 ideal—a	 line	 of	 inevitable
corruption	 begins.	 Gradually	 it	 balloons	 into	 a
world	city	or	megapolis,	which	then	undergoes	an
inevitable	 decline	 and	 ends	 with	 a	 handful	 of
nomads	camping	in	the	ruins.
Spengler	
prophesied	
that	
(white	
male)
Western	 Europe	 would	 lose	 its	 world	 hegemony
and	 that	 Western	 Culture,	 like	 all	 other	 cultures,
would	go	under.	For	Spengler,	each	Culture	has	its
own	new	possibilities	of	self-expression	that	arise,
ripen,	 decay,	 and	 never	 return.	 These	 Cultures
grow	 with	 the	 same	 superb	 aimlessness	 as	 the
flowers	 of	 the	 field,	 a	 romantic	 concept	 that
Spengler	 borrowed	 from	 Goethe,	 who,	 in	 his
holistic	or	organic	ideal	of	nature,	described	plants
and	animals	developing	in	the	same	fashion.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
214
As	Spengler	(1962)	put	it,	the	problem	of	the
“Decline	of	the	West”	is	the	problem	of	Civilization.
There	
is	
an	
organic	
succession	
in	
which
Civilization	 is	 the	 inevitable	 destiny	 of	 each
Culture;	 “Civilizations	 are	 the	 most	 external	 and
artificial	 states	 of	 which	 a	 species	 of	 developed
humanity	is	capable”	(p.	24).	As	an	example	of	the
change	 from	 Culture	 to	 Civilization,	 he	 discussed
the	 shift	 from	 the	 Greeks	 to	 the	 Romans:	 “The
Romans	were	barbarians	who	did	not	precede	but
closed	 a	 great	 development”	 (p.	 24).	 Spengler
continued,	“Unspiritual,	unphilosophical,	devoid	of
art,	 clannish	 to	 the	 point	 of	 brutality,	 aiming
relentlessly	 at	 tangible	 successes,	 they	 stand
between	the	Hellenic	Culture	and	nothingness”	(p.
24).	 He	 attempted	 to	 demonstrate	 an	 inevitable
line	of	development	in	human	groups	culminating
in	 Civilization,	 in	 which	 “appears	 this	 type	 of
strong-minded,	completely	nonmetaphysical	man”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
215
(p.	 25).	 This	 type	 of	 individual	 represents
“Civilization,”	a	late	phase	of	the	decline	of	every
Culture.
Spengler	 (1962)	 claimed	 that	 the	 transition
from	 Culture	 to	 Civilization	 occurred	 in	 the
Western	world	in	the	nineteenth	century,	just	as	it
occurred	 for	 the	 Greek	 classical	 world	 in	 the
fourth	century	B.C.	When	this	happens,	he	wrote,
“in	place	of	a	type-true	people,	born	of	and	grown
on	the	soil,	there	is	a	new	sort	of	nomad,	cohering
unstably	 in	 fluid	 masses,	 the	 parasitical	 city
dweller,	
traditionless,	
utterly	
matter-of-fact,
religionless,	
clever,	
unfruitful,	
deeply
contemptuous	 of	 the	 countryman.	 …	 The	 world-
city	means	cosmopolitanism	in	place	of	‘home.’	...
To	the	world-city	belongs	not	a	folk	but	a	mob”	(p.
25).
Heidegger	(1962)	later	took	up	this	concept	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
216
“home”	when	he	drew	the	distinction	between	the
planet	on	which	we	dwell	as	an	ancient	landscape
and	background	providing	a	context	for	everyday
life,	 and	 an	 inauthentic	 existence	 marked	 by
“turbulence”	 and	 exerting	 a	 whirlpool	 effect,
pulling	individuals	in	the	world	city	into	a	frenzy
of	 what	 one	 of	 my	 North	 Shore	 patients	 called
“shopping	 and	 lunching.”	 Or,	 as	 Spengler	 (1962)
put	 it,	 there	 is	 “the	 reappearance	 of	 pattern	 et
circettses	in	the	form	of	wage-disputes	and	sports
stadia—all	 these	 things	 betoken	 the	 definite
closing	down	of	the	Culture	and	the	opening	of	a
quite	new	phase	of	human	existence”	(p.	26).	This,
Spengler	 claimed,	 helps	 us	 to	 comprehend	 the
great	 crisis	 of	 the	 present.	 The	 hallmark	 of
Civilization	today,	Spengler	insisted,	in	contrast	to
the	 Culture	 of	 yesterday,	 is	 the	 way	 in	 which
rhetoric	 and	 journalism	 serve	 money,	 which
represents	 the	 power	 of	 Civilization:	 “It	 is	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
217
money-spirit	 which	 penetrates	 unremarked	 the
historical	forms	of	the	people’s	existence”	(pp.	26-
27)	in	a	Civilization.	More	generally,	“The	energy
of	 culture-man	 is	 directed	 inwards,	 that	 of
civilization-man	outwards”	(p.	28),	so	that	there	is
an	 expansive	 tendency,	 “a	 doom,	 something
daemonic	 and	 immense,	 which	 grips,	 forces	 into
service,	 and	 uses	 up	 the	 late	 mankind	 of	 the
world-city	stage,	willy-nilly,	aware	or	unaware”	(p.
28).	There	has	been	a	line	of	development	in	the
Western	world	that	leaves	us	as	a	civilized,	not	a
Gothic	or	Rococo,	people:	“We	have	to	reckon	with
the	 hard	 cold	 facts	 of	 a	 late	 life,	 to	 which	 the
parallel	is	to	be	found	not	in	Pericles’	Athens	but
in	Caesar’s	Rome”	(p.	31).
As	 it	 happened	 in	 the	 fourth	 century	 B.C.	 for
the	classical	world	and	in	the	nineteenth	century
for	the	Western	world,	there	developed	the	great
world	 cities	 with	 the	 provinces	 relegated	 to	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
218
background.	
Culture	
cities	
like	
Florence,
Nuremberg,	Bruges,	and	Prague	became	provincial
towns.	 In	 this	 shift	 from	 Culture	 to	 Civilization,
argued	
Spengler	
(1926),	
cosmopolitanism
replaces	 home,	 cold	 matter	 of	 fact	 replaces
reverence	
for	
tradition	
and	
age,	
scientific
irreligion	 replaces	 the	 old	 religion	 of	 the	 heart,
society	 replaces	 the	 state,	 and	 natural	 rights
replace	 hard-earned	 rights.	 In	 short,	 “Any	 high
ideal	of	life	becomes	largely	a	question	of	money”
(p.	33).
His	 argument	 that	 Western	 culture	 shifted	 to
civilization	 in	 the	 1800s	 is	 buttressed	 by	 the
historian	Johnson	(1991),	who	gives	an	extremely
detailed	 description	 of	 the	 period	 from	 1815	 to
1830	in	which	the	so-called	modern	age	began,	an
age	 of	 technology	 that	 Spengler	 would	 define	 as
the	civilization	phase	of	Western	culture.	Spengler
concluded	 his	 first	 volume	 by	 predicting	 that	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
219
spiritual	crisis	will	involve	Europe	and	America.
Some	 civilizations	 do	 not	 always	 disappear,
and	 certain	 ones,	 like	 India	 and	 China,	 may	 last
indefinitely	in	their	decadent	form.	Spengler	also
conceded	 that	 cultures	 can	 perish	 through
external	 assault,	 as	 when	 the	 Spaniards	 invaded
the	 Western	 Hemisphere	 and	 destroyed	 the	 old
Mexican	
world.	
In	
his	
concept	
of
“pseudomorphosis,”	 a	 culture	 too	 close	 to	 a
stronger	 culture	 can	 perish	 by	 what	 he	 called
“spiritual	 damage.”	 Thus,	 for	 example,	 Russian
culture	 was	 deformed	 by	 the	 intrusions	 of
Faustian	culture,	first	in	Peter	the	Great’s	reforms
and	 again	 in	 the	 Bolshevik	 revolution.	 Whereas
Russian	 culture	 is	 what	 Spengler	 called	 a	 “flat-
plane	
culture,”	
characterized	
by	
low-lying
buildings	 and	 nondiscriminating	 brotherhood,	 as
in	the	novels	of	Dostoevsky,	the	ancient	Egyptian
culture	
is	
a	
one-dimensional	
world,	
its
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
220
architecture	predominantly	a	corridor	enclosed	in
masonry,	 and	 moving	 down	 a	 narrow	 and
inexorably	prescribed	life	path.
Like	 Hegel	 (1976),	 Spengler	 explained	 that
each	 philosophy	 expresses	 only	 its	 own	 time.
Spengler	 (1926),	 not	 Heidegger,	 introduced	 the
importance	 of	 longing	 and	 dread,	 a	 “trickling-
away”	 (p.	 78)	 that	 we	 feel	 in	 the	 present	 as	 our
dread	of	mortality;	death	as	a	frontier,	inexorable
and	 irreversible.	 Spengler	 contended	 that	 this
“enigma	of	time”	(p.	79)	runs	through	all	creativity
and	 philosophy,	 a	 theme	 made	 famous	 by
Heidegger	(1962).
Spengler	(1962)	saw	a	similar	inevitable	line	of
corruption	 in	 the	 development	 of	 philosophy,
correctly	 forecasting	 the	 current	 trend	 toward
Rorty’s	 (1979,	 1982)	 pragmatics,	 neo-Marxist
criticism,	
and	
hermeneutics	
(see
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
221
HERMENEUTICS).	 He	 (1962)	 concluded	 that	 we
cannot	help	it	“if	we	are	born	as	men	of	the	early
winter	 of	 a	 full	 Civilization,	 instead	 of	 on	 the
golden	summit	of	a	ripe	Culture,	in	a	Phidias	or	a
Mozart	 time.	 Everything	 depends	 on	 our	 seeing
our	 own	 position,	 our	 destiny,	 clearly,	 on	 our
realizing	 that	 though	 we	 may	 lie	 to	 ourselves
about	it,	we	cannot	evade	it”	(p.	34).
The	noted	educator	Robert	Maynard	Hutchins
(1968)	struggled	with	a	similar	and	perhaps	more
familiar	line	of	decline	and	growth	of	corruption	in
the	 individual.	 In	 a	 lecture	 to	 college	 graduates
from	the	University	of	Chicago,	he	explained:
I	 am	 not	 worried	 about	 your	 economic
future.	I	am	worried	about	your	morals.	My
experience	and	observation	lead	me	to	warn
you	that	the	greatest,	the	most	insidious,	the
most	 paralyzing	 danger	 you	 will	 face	 is	 the
danger	of	corruption.	Time	will	corrupt	you.
Your	 friends,	 your	 wives	 or	 husbands,	 your
business	 or	 professional	 associates	 will
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
222
corrupt	 you;	 your	 social,	 political,	 and
financial	 ambitions	 will	 corrupt	 you.	 The
worst	 thing	 about	 life	 is	 that	 it	 is
demoralizing,	[p.	1]
As	 Hutchins	 put	 it,	 “‘Getting	 on’	 is	 the	 great
American	 aspiration.	 And	 here	 the	 demoralizing
part	comes	in;	the	way	to	get	on	is	to	be	‘safe,’	to
be	 ‘sound,’	 to	 be	 agreeable,	 to	 be	 inoffensive,	 to
have	 no	 views	 on	 important	 matters	 not
sanctioned	by	the	majority,	by	your	superiors,	or
by	your	group”	(p.	2).
Hutchins	 points	 out	 that	 by	 helping	 students
learn	 to	 think,	 universities	 tend	 to	 make	 them
resistant	to	pressure,	propaganda,	or	reward,	and
to	 make	 them	 dissatisfied	 and	 want	 to	 do
something	to	improve	the	conditions	under	which
people	 live.	 Proper	 education,	 which	 forms
university	graduates	into	independent	individuals,
causes	 problems	 in	 “getting	 on”	 and	 in	 fact,	 as
Hutchins	 explains,	 they	 may	 not	 even	 be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
223
interested	 in	 getting	 on.	 Yet	 everybody	 now	 is
afraid,	 writes	 Hutchins	 presciently	 in	 1935.	 He
continues:
We	are	convinced	that	by	knowing	the	right
people,	wearing	the	right	clothes,	saying	the
right	things,	holding	the	right	opinions,	and
thinking	 the	 right	 thoughts,	 we	 shall	 all	 get
on;	 we	 shall	 all	 get	 on	 to	 some	 motion-
picture	 paradise,	 surrounded	 by	 fine	 cars,
refreshing	 drinks,	 and	 admiring	 ladies.	 So
persuasive	 is	 this	 picture	 that	 we	 find
politicians	 during	 campaigns	 making	 every
effort	 to	 avoid	 saying	 anything;	 we	 find
important	 people	 condoning	 fraud	 and
corruption	 in	 high	 places	 because	 it	 would
be	upsetting	to	attack	it.	[p.	2]
Hutchins	 concludes	 with	 an	 exhortation	 to	 the
graduates	 of	 the	 university	 to	 not	 let	 “practical”
people	tell	them	they	should	surrender	their	ideals
because	 they	 are	 impractical.	 He	 begs	 them,	 “Do
not	 be	 reconciled	 to	 dishonesty,	 indecency,	 and
brutality	 because	 gentlemanly	 ways	 have	 been
discovered	 of	 being	 dishonest,	 indecent,	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
224
brutal”	(p.	4),	and	he	urges	them	to	take	a	stand
now	 when	 they	 are	 graduating,	 before	 time
corrupts	them.
The	 explanation	 of	 this	 inevitable	 decline	 in
both	 cultures	 and	 individuals	 can	 be	 more
sophisticated	and	depth-psychological	now	than	it
was	 in	 the	 days	 of	 Spengler,	 Heidegger,	 and
Hutchins.	The	problem	of	life	lies	in	the	necessity
to	withstand	the	inevitable	narcissistic	wounding
that	 occurs	 as	 a	 function	 of	 the	 vicissitudes	 of
every	person’s	existence	and	of	the	existence	of	a
Culture	as	it	struggles	to	manifest	itself	in	a	world
of	 Civilizations.	 As	 this	 wounding	 through
disappointment	occurs,	there	is	a	shriveling	of	the
soul	
that	
Freud	
(1914)	
called	
secondary
narcissism,	a	tendency	of	the	libidinal	investment
in	objects	to	be	withdrawn	into	the	self;	this	takes
place	 not	 only	 as	 a	 consequence	 of	 inevitable
narcissistic	
wounding	
but	
even	
as	
the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
225
consequence	 of	 the	 anticipation	 of	 narcissistic
wounding,	 such	 as	 recognizing	 one’s	 inevitable
physical	 decline	 and	 death,	 which	 in	 our	 youth-
oriented	 culture	 bring	 scorn	 and	 indifference.
Hence	 we	 observe	 the	 typical	 phenomenon	 of
elderly	people	who	frequently	lose	interest	in	the
problems	 of	 others	 and	 become	 extremely
preoccupied	 with	 themselves,	 their	 finances,	 and
their	innumerable	physical	complaints.
This	 progresses	 to	 a	 withdrawal	 of	 libidinal
investment	 in	 the	 ego-ideal,	 so	 that	 in	 the	 final
stage	 of	 our	 typically	 corrupted	 individual	 we
observe	also	a	cynicism,	a	rage,	and	a	Scroogelike
mentality,	 what	 Erikson	 (1959)	 called	 despair
rather	than	integrity.	He	explains,	“Such	a	despair
is	 often	 hidden	 behind	 a	 show	 of	 disgust,	 a
misanthropy,	
or	
a	
chronic	
contemptuous
displeasure	 with	 particular	 institutions	 and
particular	 people—a	 disgust	 and	 displeasure
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
226
which	…	only	signify	the	individual’s	contempt	of
himself’	 (p.	 98).	 People	 vary	 in	 their	 capacity	 to
withstand	 this	 decaying	 process,	 as	 a	 function	 of
their	capacity	to	withstand	narcissistic	wounding
or,	as	Kohut	(1971)	would	put	it,	as	a	function	of
the	basic	cohesiveness	of	their	selves.
Similarly,	 in	 Civilization	 we	 observe	 the
development	of	the	big-city	dweller	described	by
Spengler,	who	has	withdrawn	libidinal	investment
from	neighboring	people	as	well	as	from	any	sort
of	humanistic,	philosophical,	spiritual,	or	religious
ideals.	 As	 this	 individual	 steps	 nonchalantly
around	 the	 homeless	 street	 beggars,	 he	 or	 she
marks	
what	
is	
usually	
described	
as	
the
Alexandrian	 phase	 of	 culture.	 In	 this	 form,	 or
Civilization,	art	becomes	gigantic,	morals	flexible,
and	
religious	
observances	
perfunctory.
Cosmopolitan	 tastes,	 populist	 standards,	 and
esoteric	cults	predominate.	High	and	low	fashions
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
227
or	 fads	 come	 and	 go	 with	 amazing	 rapidity,	 and
extremes	of	feminism	appear,	including	hatred	of
men	and	confusion	in	gender	roles	to	the	point	of
denying	even	biologically	obvious	differences.
Massie	 (1991)	 has	 described	 in	 great	 detail
certain	crucial	and	representative	individuals	and
the	 general	 populace	 of	 the	 British	 and	 German
Civilizations	 of	 the	 twenty-five	 or	 thirty	 years
before	 the	 actual	 outbreak	 of	 World	 War	 I.	 His
work	 demonstrates	 the	 theses	 of	 both	 Spengler
and	Hutchins	quite	dramatically.	The	unfortunate
link	 between	 the	 decline	 of	 individuals	 and	 the
decline	 of	 cultures	 is	 that	 the	 individuals	 with
power	in	cultures	are	already	in	the	stage	of	the
personal	decline	of	their	ideals,	and	therefore	are
more	 likely	 to	 accept	 rather	 than	 resist	 the
corruption	 and	 disintegration	 of	 the	 springtime
values	of	the	Culture	and	of	the	individual	that	are
taking	 place.	 Hence	 the	 public	 elects	 banal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
228
mediocrities	 again	 and	 again	 who	 symbolize	 the
corrupt	 status	 of	 the	 ego-ideal	 and	 who	 hasten
rather	than	oppose	further	decline.
We	should	never	forget	that	in	psychoanalytic
work	we	transmit	to	our	patients	and	our	students
the	status	of	our	value	system,	whether	we	wish	to
do	 so	 or	 not,	 so	 this	 problem	 is	 of	 immediate
personal	 concern	 to	 every	 individual	 who	 deals
with	 the	 psychological	 problems	 of	 another
person.	 An	 extreme	 example	 is	 found	 in	 the
disintegration	 of	 psychoanalysis	 in	 France	 into
quarreling	 schisms,	 schools,	 and	 counterschools,
as	 the	 history	 of	 Lacan	 and	 his	 followers	 and
enemies	and	ever-changing	alliances	dramatically
entails	 (Roudinesco	 1990,	 Turkle	 1978).	 A	 less
flamboyant	but	still	sad	and	unfortunate	example
is	that	of	“The	New	York	Psychoanalytic	Civil	War”
described	by	Frosch	(1991),	a	turmoil	marked	by
“personal	 differences,	 power	 struggles,	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
229
ideological	differences”	(p.	1058).	The	effect	of	this
on	 the	 students	 and	 patients	 of	 the	 eminent
psychoanalysts	involved	is	quite	significant	and	is
well	documented	in	The	Freud-Klein	Controversies
(King	 and	 Steiner	 1991),	 a	 record	 of	 the	 crisis
situation	 in	 the	 British	 Psycho-Analytical	 Society
shortly	after	Freud’s	death	in	1939.
Personal	 narcissistic	 and	 other	 investments
may	underlie	apparent	“scientific	disagreements”
in	 the	 field.	 Stein	 (1991)	 points	 out	 that
countertransference	
(see
COUNTERTRANSFERENCE)	
has	
a	
hitherto
unrecognized	important	further	source,	“deriving
from	 the	 utilized	 theory	 of	 the	 analyst.	 This
countertransference	 may	 occur	 independently	 of
the	patient’s	motivation	and	independently	of	the
internal	 dynamics	 of	 the	 analyst”	 (p.	 326).	 King
and	Steiner	(1991)	tell	us:
Overtly,	controversy	was	mainly	couched	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
230
terms	 of	 scientific	 differences	 of	 opinion
about	 what	 was	 considered	 to	 be	 accepted
psychoanalytical	 theory	 and	 technique,	 as
formulated	 by	 Freud,	 and	 what	 view	 of	 it
should	
be	
taught	
to	
students	
of
psychoanalysis	or	included	in	public	lectures
by	
analysts	
representing	
the	
Society.
Inevitably,	these	issues	also	masked	deeper
ones	 to	 do	 with	 who	 should	 decide	 these
questions,	 and	 therefore,	 which	 individuals
and	groups	held	power	in	the	Society,	[p.	9]
Following	 Steiner	 (1985),	 there	 is	 much	 to	 be
learned	 from	 an	 examination	 of	 the	 power
struggles	
and	
narcissistic	
investments
demonstrated	in	the	Freud-Klein	controversies	for
those	 who	 are	 involved	 in	 the	 current	 power
structures	and	hierarchies	of	organized	psychiatry
and	 psychoanalysis.	 There	 may	 be	 an	 inevitable
development	of	corruption.	This	can	occur	both	in
the	 individual	 and	 in	 the	 Culture,	 from	 a
springtime	 of	 optimism	 to	 a	 winter	 of	 cynicism
and	 despair.	 It	 is	 extremely	 important	 for	 every
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
231
therapist	 to	 examine	 his	 or	 her	 position	 on	 this
corruption	
scale,	
because	
this	
position	
is
transmitted	and	has	an	effect	on	the	ego-ideal	of
the	 patient.	 The	 lack	 of	 explicit	 attention	 paid	 to
one’s	 ideals	 and	 values	 and	 one’s	 motivation	 to
live	up	to	them	and	sacrifice	for	them	will	have	an
important	 subliminal	 effect	 on	 the	 treatment
process.

COUNTERTRANSFERENCE
Countertransference	 reactions	 have	 a	 very
important	
impact	
on	
the	
process	
of
psychotherapy.	The	whole	subject	is	controversial
and	poorly	understood,	and	the	reader	will	have	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
234
be	 satisfied	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 definitions	 and
conflicting	attempts	at	clarification	of	the	situation
(Baum	1969-1970).	Singer	(1970)	points	out	that
countertransference	 seems	 to	 appear	 “when	 the
therapist	is	made	anxious	by	the	patient,	when	he
fears	 feelings	 and	 ideas	 which	 therapeutic
investigation	 may	 arouse	 in	 him,	 and	 when	 his
desire	to	avoid	anxiety	and	its	dynamic	roots	force
him	 into	 assuming	 defensive	 attitudes”	 (p.	 296).
These	 defensive	 attitudes	 interfere	 with	 genuine
therapeutic	understanding	of	the	patient.	Dewald
(1976)	conceives	of	the	psychoanalytic	process	as
involving	
a	
new	
model	
of	
interpersonal
interaction.	
Countertransference	
leads	
to
disruption	 when	 the	 analyst’s	 response	 repeats
that	 of	 the	 parents	 and	 repetition	 rather	 than	 a
new	experience	prevails.
In	 the	 broadest	 terms,	 countertransference	 is
best	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 manifestation	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
235
therapist’s	reluctance	to	know	or	learn	something
about	himself	or	herself.	It	is	a	reflection	of	a	wish
to	remain	oblivious	to	certain	facets	of	the	psyche
and	 to	 allow	 unresolved	 intrapsychic	 conflicts	 to
remain	 buried.	 This	 powerful	 counterforce	 can
move	 the	 therapist	 to	 quite	 hostile	 behavior
against	patients.	The	hostility,	which	can	be	either
overt	 or	 covert,	 may	 be	 expressed	 in	 acts	 of
omission	
or	
commission	
or	
in	
irrational
“friendliness”	or	irrational	annoyance	or	anger.	In
fact,	 McLaughlin	 (1981)	 suggests	 dropping	 the
term	“countertransference”	entirely	as	it	assumes
that	 the	 analyst	 was	 pushed	 by	 the	 patient	 from
his	or	her	usual	neutral	“wise”	state.	He	suggests
the	 term	 “analyst’s	 transferences,”	 to	 stress	 the
shared	 adventure	 of	 two	 humans	 together.
Similarly,	 Brenner	 (1985)	 sees	 no	 need	 for	 the
term	“countertransference,”	which	for	him	simply
is	 the	 transference	 of	 the	 analyst	 in	 an	 analytic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
236
situation.	The	set	of	compromise	formations	“that
being	 an	 analyst	 is,”	 involving	 these	 drives	 and
defenses	 against	 them,	 allows	 normal	 analytic
functioning;	 when	 these	 shift	 due	 to	 various
circumstances,	 analytic	 work	 is	 helped	
or
hindered.
According	
to	
Singer	
(1970),
countertransference	 reactions	 can	 be	 grouped
roughly	 into	 three	 categories:	 (a)	 reactions	 of
irrational	“kindness”	and	“concern,”	(b)	reactions
of	 irrational	 hostility	 toward	 the	 patient,	 and	 (c)
anxiety	 reactions	 by	 the	 therapist	 to	 the	 patient.
All	 of	 these	 may	 occur	 in	 waking	 life	 or	 in	 the
dreams	or	fantasies	of	the	therapist.
Probably	
the	
most	
quoted	
study	
of
countertransference	 is	 by	 Racker	 (1968),	 who
tried	to	understand	the	deep	infantile	and	possibly
neurotic	roots	of	countertransference	reactions	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
237
some	 very	 controversial	 ways	 utilizing	 Kleinian
theory.	 Hunt	 and	 Issacharoff	 (1977)	 review	 his
important	contribution.	Racker	points	out	that	the
significance	given	to	countertransference	depends
on	 two	 misfortunes	 that	 it	 generates:	 (a)
countertransference	 may	 distort	 or	 hinder	 the
perception	of	unconscious	processes	in	the	patient
by	the	therapist;	and	(b)	countertransference	may
not	 interfere	 with	 the	 therapist’s	 perception	 of
what	 is	 going	 on,	 but	 it	 may	 impair	 the
interpretive	 capacity	 of	 the	 therapist.	 So	 the
manner,	 behavior,	 tone	 of	 voice,	 form	 of	 the
interpretations,	 even	 the	 attitude	 toward	 the
patient	 consciously	 or	 unconsciously	 may	 be
vastly	 influenced	 by	 countertransference.	 A
patient’s	complaint	of	the	tone,	manner,	or	voice	of
the	 therapist	 is	 not	 always	 a	 manifestation	 of
transference	 to	 the	 therapist.	 It	 may	 instead
represent	
the	
patient’s	
perception	
of	
a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
238
countertransference	problem	in	the	therapist,	for,
as	Arlow	(1985)	reminds	us,	“much	as	we	observe
and	study	the	patients,	the	patients	do	the	same	to
us.	They	observe	our	reactions,	often	in	order	to
ascertain	
what	
they	
can	
do	
to	
provoke
gratification	of	their	infantile	strivings”	(p.	172).
An	 understanding	 of	 countertransference	 is
vital	to	the	success	of	psychotherapy.	It	is	usually
defined	 in	 two	 limited	 ways	 or	 in	 one	 or	 more
general	 fashion	 (Greenson	 1978).	 The	 most
limited	definition	of	countertransference	is	that	it
consists	 of	 a	 set	 of	 therapist	 transference
reactions,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 fantasies,	 feelings,
thoughts,	 and	 behavior,	 to	 the	 transference
manifestations	 and	 the	 transference	 neurosis	 of
the	 patient.	 The	 formal	 psychoanalytic	 definition
in	 use	 today	 usually	 amends	 this	 to	 include
therapist	 transference	 reactions—involving,	 of
course,	 the	 significant	 persons	 in	 the	 therapist’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
239
childhood—to	
any	
aspect	
of	
the	
patient’s
personality,	 including	 the	 patient’s	 transference
(Reich	1973).
The	
	
most	
general	
definition	
of
countertransference	 is	 the	 total	 reaction	 of	 the
therapist,	 both	 the	 transference	 or	 the	 realistic
reaction,	to	all	aspects	of	the	patient’s	transference
and	general	personality.	Kernberg	(1975)	pointed
out	that	the	early	appearance	of	such	totalistic	or
global	 countertransference	 in	 an	 intense—	 and
usually	 uncomfortable—form	 is	 typical	 in	 the
treatment	 of	 borderline	 patients.	 An	 extreme
example	of	this	is	the	countertransference	hatred
described	by	Maltsberger	and	Buie	(1974),	which
can	 develop	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 borderline,
psychotic,	 and	 suicidal	 patients.	 Thus	 totalistic
countertransferences	 tend	 to	 develop	 as	 a
response	
to	
intense	
archaic	
transferences,
although	Winnicott	(1958)	argues	that	some	hate
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
240
is	
always	
present	
in	
latent	
form	
in	
all
countertransference	 to	 all	 patients;	 it	 becomes	 a
problem	 especially	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 more
psychotic	 types	 of	 patients	 and	 a	 great	 strain	 on
the	 analyst	 of	 such	 patients.	 Chediak	 (1979),
however,	 prefers	 to	 call	 these	 “counterreactions”
rather	than	countertransferences.
Therapists	should	be	aware	of	their	reactions
to	the	realistic	aspects	of	the	patient’s	personality,
and	of	their	transference	reactions	to	the	patient,
with	 focus	 on	 what	 aspects	 of	 the	 patient	 have
stirred	 up	 countertransference.	 The	 purpose	 of
this	 is	 neither	 to	 act	 out	 nor	 to	 share
countertransference	 problems	 with	 the	 patient
but	to	determine	what	aspects	of	the	patient	are
producing	
the	
countertransference,	
for	
the
purpose	 of	 further	 understanding.	 It	 is	 nonsense
to	 burden	 the	 patient	 with	 countertransference
problems,	
especially	
those	
aspects	
of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
241
countertransference	 that	 are	 the	 therapist’s
transference	to	the	patient.	This	is	exploitation	of
the	patient	and	belongs	in	the	personal	therapy	of
the	 psychotherapist.	 Racker	 (1968)	 and	 others
have	
distinguished	
between	
a
“countertransference	
structure,”	
a
“countertransference	
neurosis,”	
and	
a
“countertransference	 character	 disturbance.”	 The
countertransference	structure	is	a	consistent	and
relatively	
permanent	
aggregate	
of	
feelings,
fantasies,	and	ways	of	reacting	that	develop	in	the
therapist	as	a	response	to	the	transference	and	the
personality	 of	 the	 patient	 over	 a	 long	 period	 of
psychotherapy	(Tower	1956).
A	 countertransference	 neurosis	 (Greenson
1978)	is	said	to	occur	when	the	patient	becomes
more	important	to	the	therapist	than	anyone	else
in	 his	 or	 her	 life.	 Except	 possibly	 in	 certain
situations	
involving	
the	
psychotherapy	
of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
242
schizophrenics,	 as	 suggested	 by	 Searles	 (1965),
the	countertransference	neurosis	is	almost	always
pathological	 and	 can	 be	 very	 dangerous.	 Racker
(1968)	
interprets	
the	
countertransference
neurosis	 mainly	 as	 an	 oedipal	 phenomenon,	 but
this	 is	 subject	 to	 considerable	 debate.	 In	 my
experience	 it	 appears	 as	 a	 manifestation	 of
impaired	 ego	 functioning	 in	 the	 therapist,	 an
impairment	 that	 can	 occur	 for	 many	 reasons.
Arlow	 (1985)	 gives	 three	 typical	 situations	 that
evoke	 or	 foster	 countertransference:	 (a)	 a	 fixed
identification	
with	
the	
patient	
due	
to	
a
correspondence	 of	 unconscious	 wishes	 and
fantasies;	 (b)	 fantasies	 and	 wishes	 of	 the	 analyst
evoked	by	the	patient’s	wishes	and	fantasies,	such
as	 the	 patient’s	 wish	 to	 be	 rescued	 and	 the
analyst’s	 wish	 to	 rescue;	 and	 (c)	 the	 analytic
setting,	 which	 offers	 tempting	 opportunities	 for
the	analyst	to	gratify	narcissistic	needs.

Just	 as	 we	 differentiate	 among	 patients
between	neuroses	and	character	disturbances,	and
their	various	corresponding	transferences,	so	we
can	 differentiate	 countertransference	 neuroses
and	 countertransference	 character	 disturbances,
although	 this	 rarely	 appears	 in	 the	 literature.
Countertransference	
character	
disturbances
involve	 the	 therapist’s	 character.	 His	 or	 her
countertransference	 character	 disturbance	 is
analogous	 to	 the	 patient’s	 character	 defenses.
Thus	
the	
countertransference	
character
disturbance	in	the	therapist	would	involve	certain
forms	 of	 behavior	 and	 a	 general	 interpersonal
approach	 to	 the	 patient,	 suggesting	 that	 the
patient	was	someone	significant	in	the	therapist’s
past	 life	 who	 called	 forth	 this	 general	 character
pattern	 in	 the	 therapist.	 It	 is	 sometimes	 very
difficult	to	spot	this,	but	it	is	very	 important	 and
does	not	get	nearly	the	attention	it	deserves.	Many
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
244
failures	 in	 psychotherapy	 can	 be	 traced	 to
unconscious	
countertransference	
character
disturbances.
A	 variety	 of	 authors	 (see	 Menninger	 1958)
have	 discussed	 the	 signals	 that	 indicate	 the
presence	 of	 a	 countertransference	 problem	 (see
also	 EXIT	 LINE).	 After	 establishing	 a	 particular
structure	 and	 routine	 of	 procedure	 with	 each
patient,	the	therapist	should	carefully	examine	any
departures	 from	 the	 routine	 because	 they	 may
well	 be	 related	 to	 countertransference	 (Langs
1979).	This	includes	the	decision	to	offer	ancillary
psychopharmacological	
agents	
and	
other
modalities.	 Even	 the	 most	 mature	 and	 well-
analyzed	 psychotherapist	 is	 going	 to	 have
important	
countertransference	
reactions	
to
patients	 over	 a	 period	 of	 time	 (Reich	 1973).	 A
countertransference	 structure,	 as	 defined	 above,
always	
appears	
in	
long-term	
intensive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
245
psychotherapy.
The	 difference	 between	 the	 novice	 and	 the
experienced	
psychotherapist	
is	
that	
the
experienced	psychotherapist	is	constantly	on	the
lookout	 for	 the	 countertransference	 and	 the
countertransference	structure,	becomes	aware	of
it	 when	 it	 occurs,	 engages	 in	 continuous	 self-
analysis,	 keeps	 countertransference	 in	 check	 by
not	
permitting	
the	
acting	
out	
of
countertransference	 feelings,	 and	 holds	 it	 in
abeyance	or	even	utilizes	it	for	the	purpose	of	the
psychotherapy.
In	attempting	to	identify	countertransference,
therapists	 must	 apply	 the	 same	 standards	 of
honest	and	forthright	self-appraisal	to	themselves
that	 they	 expect	 of	 their	 patients.	 When	 a
countertransference	
problem	
is	
severe,	
the
therapist	 may	 have	 to	 consider	 at	 least	 one	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
246
three	 alternatives.	 The	 first	 of	 these,	 and	 the
simplest,	is	to	keep	therapeutic	interventions	and
activity	 at	 a	 minimum	 for	 a	 short	 period	 of	 time
while	busily	working	through	countertransference
problems	in	self-analysis.	A	general	rule	is	that	if
the	 therapist	 feels	 anxious	 with	 the	 patient,
interpretations	
or	
therapeutic	
interventions
should	not	be	made,	since	they	almost	invariably
will	be	meant	to	allay	the	therapist’s	own	anxiety.
If	 self-analysis	 is	 not	 successful,	 as	 a	 second
alternative	 the	 therapist	 ought	 to	 consult	 a
colleague.	 My	 experience	 has	 been	 that	 a
consultation	is	extremely	helpful	and	important	in
dealing	 with	 countertransference.	 A	 great	 many
cases	 of	 personal	 disaster,	 suicide,	 sexual	 acting
out,	failure,	and	stalemate	in	psychotherapy	could
have	been	prevented	if	the	therapist	had	had	the
courage	 to	 get	 a	 consultation	 from	 a	 respected
colleague	at	the	point	he	or	she	became	aware	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
247
countertransference	 manifestations.	 If	 after	 this
the	
therapist	
feels	
chronically	
anxious	
or
otherwise	 disturbed	 with	 a	 patient,	 as	 a	 third
alternative	 he	 or	 she	 should	 consider	 further
personal	psychoanalysis.
I	 insist	 on	 two	 maxims	 regarding	 behavior
toward	
one’s	
patients	
as	
the	
“categorical
imperatives”	 of	 psychotherapy.	 These	 serve	 as	 a
check	on	countertransference	acting	out:	Never	be
either	 exploitative	 or	 retaliative	 toward	 your
patients,	and	always	behave	as	you	would	toward
a	guest	in	your	home	with	your	spouse	present.	I
have	 seen	 cases	 where	 a	 famous	 maxim	 from
Benjamin	Franklin’s	Poor	Richard’s	Almanac,	had	it
been	followed,	would	have	saved	a	disaster	in	the
psychotherapy:	“Do	not	do	that	which	you	would
not	 have	 known”—that	 is	 to	 say,	 do	 not	 behave
with	 the	 patient	 in	 psychotherapy	 in	 such	 a	 way
that	 you	 would	 be	 unwilling	 to	 have	 it	 generally
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
248
broadcast	and	known	to	your	colleagues.	Here	lies
a	third	important	imperative	to	serve	as	a	check
on	
countertransference	
acting	
out	
in
psychotherapy.
Countertransference	should	not	be	thought	of
as	intrinsically	negative.	It	only	becomes	negative
and	 interferes	 in	 psychotherapy	 when	 it	 is	 not
correctly	recognized	and	handled.	The	aim	of	the
therapy	 of	 the	 therapist	 is	 not	 to	 remove	 the
possibility	of	all	countertransference	reactions	but
to	 make	 the	 therapist	 capable	 of	 being	 aware	 of
these	 reactions	 and	 of	 dealing	 appropriately	 and
maturely	with	them.	Sometimes	these	reactions,	if
studied	
objectively,	
can	
lead	
to	
further
information	 and	 data	 about	 the	 patient.	 If	 the
therapist	 notices	 a	 countertransference	 reaction
and	 analyzes	 this,	 he	 or	 she	 may	 become	 aware
that	 something	 the	 patient	 is	 doing	 or	 saying	 is
producing	countertransference.	The	therapist	may
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
249
not	have	been	aware	previously	of	the	message	or
communication	 the	 patient	 was	 trying	 to	 send.
Instead	 of	 listening,	 the	 therapist	 has	 been
reacting—suffering	 from	 a	 countertransference
reaction.	In	this	sense,	countertransference	can	be
thought	 of	 as	 a	 resistance	 to	 uncovering	 and
remembering.	The	analysis	of	countertransference
in	the	therapy	brings	the	reward	of	knowing	and
understanding	new	material.
Kohut	
(1971)	
described	
the	
typical
countertransference	responses	to	the	mirror	and
idealizing	
transferences	
encountered	
in
narcissistic	 personality	 disorders	 (and	 also	 in
other	 preoedipal	 disorders	 or	 patients	 who	 have
defensively	regressed	to	such	transferences).	The
typical	 countertransference	 to	 the	 idealizing
selfobject	 transferences	 occurs	 through	 the
mobilization	 of	 the	 therapist’s	 archaic	 grandiose
self,	
leading	
to	
an	
embarrassed	
defensive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
250
“straight-arming”	 of	 the	 patient	 by	 denial	 of	 the
idealization	
in	
various	
ways.	
Typical
countertransference	
reactions	
to	
mirror
transferences	 are	 boredom,	 lack	 of	 involvement
with	the	patient,	inattention,	annoyance,	sarcasm,
a	 tendency	 to	 lecture	 the	 patient	 out	 of
counterexhibitionism,	 or	 an	 attempt	 to	 gain
control	of	the	therapy	by	exhortation,	persuasion,
and	so	on.
Gunther	 (1976),	 utilizing	 self	 psychology,
explains	
countertransference	
phenomena	
as
aimed	at	restoring	narcissistic	equilibrium	in	the
therapist,	 which	 is	 endangered	 especially	 in
preoedipal	 cases	 by	 archaic	 demands	 of	 the
patient.	 This	 valuable	 concept	 can	 help	 explain
countertransference	
fantasies	
and	
unethical
behavior	 on	 the	 part	 of	 narcissistically	 depleted
therapists	
and	
therapists	
with	
narcissistic
personality	
disorders.	
In	
my	
supervisory
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
251
experience,	 narcissistic	 disequilibrium	 problems
are	
the	
most	
common	
generators	
of
countertransference,	although	it	is	not	possible	to
judge	 from	 supervision	 whether	 these	 problems
defend	against	deeper	unresolved	infantile	sexual
conflicts.
Wolf	(1985)	stresses	the	regression	of	both	the
patient	
and	
the	
analyst	
in	
psychoanalytic
treatment,	
and	
the	
defenses	
against	
this
regression.	
The	
analyst	
regresses	
as	
a
consequence	 of	 the	 demand	 for	 evenly	 hovering
attention	 in	 place	 of	 customary	 ways	 of	 thinking
and	 the	 constraint	 placed	 by	 the	 procedure	 on
ordinary	 self-expression	 of	 the	 analyst.	 This	 can
lead	 to	 what	 self	 psychologists	 call	 self-state
anxiety	 in	 the	 analyst.	 But	 it	 can	 also	 have
favorable	
consequences,	
including	
stronger
motivation	 to	 remain	 empathically	 in	 tune	 with
the	 patient	 and	 some	 idealization	 of	 the	 patient.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
252
The	 latter	 is	 experienced	 by	 the	 patient	 as	 a
confirmation	of	his	or	her	unrealized	potential	and
as	
a	
stimulus	
to	
live	
up	
to	
it.	
Thus
countertransference	 is	 not	 necessarily	 pathology
and	 can	 be	 a	 positive	 force	 in	 the	 treatment,
leading	to	better	cohesion	of	the	self	of	the	patient
and,	when	worked	through,	for	the	analyst.	Wolf
(1985)	claims,	“The	analytic	process	involves	both
participants—	they	both	get	analyzed,	so	to	speak”
(p.	282).
The	 interaction	 of	 the	 transference	 of	 the
patient	 and	 the	 countertransference	 structure	 of
the	therapist	is	probably	one	of	the	basic	and	most
important	
factors	
in	
healing	
through
psychoanalytic	psychotherapy.	A	parallel	struggle
goes	on	throughout	the	process	of	psychotherapy
in	both	patient	and	psychotherapist.	In	the	patient
there	is	a	struggle	between	the	forces	of	resistance
and	the	innate	biological	and	psychological	forces
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
253
toward	 health	 and	 toward	 mastering	 neurotic
conflicts.	In	the	therapist	there	is	a	struggle	arising
from	 the	 stimulus	 of	 the	 personality	 and
transference	 of	 the	 patient.	 A	 struggle	 occurs
between	 the	 desire	 to	 understand	 and	 interpret
the	 transference	 properly	 and	 the	 tendency	 to
misunderstand	and	misinterpret	the	transference
out	of	countertransference	problems.	The	patient
must	 fight	 to	 overcome	 the	 forces	 of	 the
resistance.	 The	 therapist	 must	 struggle	 within	 to
understand	 and	 master	 the	 forces	 of	 the
countertransference	
structure,	
which	
always
interfere	 with	 correct	 understanding	 of	 and
interpretations	to	the	patient.
These	 coexisting	 struggles	 are	 central	 in
determining	the	outcome	of	psychotherapy.	They
also	 explain	 this	 oft-repeated	 remark:	 In	 every
psychotherapy	 the	 therapist	 “learns”	 from	 the
patient.	 The	 therapist	 expands	 his	 or	 her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
254
boundaries	of	human	understanding,	increases	in
maturity,	 and	 achieves	 further	 ego	 integration.
Conversely,	
unanalyzed	
negative
countertransference	experiences	over	a	prolonged
period	 can	 produce	 what	 Wile	 (1972)	 calls
“therapist	
discouragement,”	
an	
irrational
pessimism	regarding	one’s	therapeutic	work	and
personal	life.	This	leads	to	premature	termination
of	 therapy	 cases,	 even	 the	 abandonment	 of	 the
profession	itself,	the	susceptibility	to	new	fads	and
shortcut	 active	 techniques,	 or	 an	 irrational
overoptimism	and	overconfidence	in	one’s	powers
of	healing.	Perhaps	worst	of	all,	“Deprived	of	his
sense	of	purpose	and	value	in	what	he	is	doing,	the
therapist	may	turn	to	his	patient	for	compensatory
reassurance	and	affirmation”	(Wile	1972,	p.	52).

CURATIVE	FANTASY
Ornstein	 and	 Ornstein	 (1977),	 utilizing	 self
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
258
psychology	rather	than	the	traditional	view,	stress
the	 “curative	 fantasy”	 with	 which	 the	 patient
begins	 treatment,	 the	 wish	 to	 have	 the	 past
undone	and	made	up	for.	When	this	is	activated	in
the	 treatment,	 there	 occurs	 an	 interaction	 or
engagement	with	the	therapist,	and	the	therapist’s
responses	are	crucial.	According	to	these	authors,
the	therapist	must	help	curative	fantasies	emerge
and	deal	with	the	guilt	over	them,	allowing	them
to	transform	and	mature.	What	is	curative	are	not
primarily	
nonspecific	
“physicianly	
vocation”
elements	 in	 the	 treatment,	 but	 the	 increased
unfolding	of	archaic	curative	fantasies,	the	wish	to
use	the	therapist	as	a	selfobject	(Kohut	1977),	and
the	hope	for	a	“new	beginning”	(Balint	1968).	The
curative	 fantasy	 motivates	 the	 patient	 toward
recovery	out	of	the	assumption	that	the	treatment
will	compensate	for	everything	by	bringing	power,
skills,	and	success.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
259
The	interpretation	of	this	fantasy	depends	on
one’s	 theoretical	 orientation.	 For	 example,	 some
would	relate	it	to	infantile	instinctual	aims	seeking
satisfaction	in	the	transference,	similar	to	Freud’s
discussion	 of	 a	 cure	 by	 love.	 Ornstein	 and
Ornstein,	from	the	point	of	view	of	self	psychology,
focus	on	the	patient’s	new	hopes	that,	due	to	the
fear	of	disappointment,	are	defended	against.	This
is	 experienced	 by	 the	 analyst	 as	 “resistance.”	 A
patient	 may	 need	 to	 set	 up	 rejecting	 situations,
despite	his	or	her	wish	to	be	accepted,	as	a	defense
against	
the	
possibility	
of	
disappointment.
Attempting	 to	 get	 the	 patient	 to	 face	 his	 or	 her
hostility	 when	 these	 fantasies	 are	 disappointed
and	when	projection	takes	place	implies	that	the
patient	 is	 unlovable	 and	 that	 something	 is
fundamentally	 wrong	 with	 the	 patient.	 Such
interpretations,	
according	
to	
Ornstein	
and
Ornstein,	 just	 retraumatize	 the	 patient.	 The	 rage
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
260
must	 be	 accepted	 as	 appropriate	 to	 the	 patient’s
experienced	
reality,	
as	
a	
response	
to	
an
experienced	 injury	 due	 to	 the	 disappointed	 wish
for	unconditional	success,	acceptance,	power,	and
skills.	For	self	psychologists,	empathic	acceptance,
followed	
by	
understanding,	
followed	
by
interpretation	 remains	 crucial	 in	 analytic	 cure
(Kohut	1984).

DASEIN
Heidegger	 (1962)	 introduced	 this	 term	 to
represent	what	is	characteristic	about	the	being	of
humans,	 “being-there,”	 This	 differentiates	 his
notion	of	human	being	from	previous	theories	that
postulated	some	sort	of	fixed	essence	or	substance
or	 “human	 nature”	 to	 members	 of	 our	 species.
Sartre	(1973)	popularized	this	by	maintaining,	in
his	 famous	 saying,	 that	 “existence	 precedes
essence.”	
Heidegger	
insisted	
what	
was
characteristic	of	humans	was	that	they	presented
a	“clearing”	in	which	Being	might	present	itself;	it
is	 Dasein	 that	 asks	 the	 question,	 Why	 is	 there
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
262
something	 rather	 than	 nothing	 at	 all?	 At	 other
times	 Heidegger	 (1977)	 speaks	 of	 Dasein	 as	 the
“shepherd	 of	 Being,”	 and	 his	 conceptions	 of	 it
become	increasingly	mystical	and	poetic.
But	 Heidegger	 did	 not	 consider	 himself	 an
existentialist.	He	was	preoccupied	with	the	nature
of	 Being,	 and	 his	 investigation	 of	 human	 being
(Dasein)	was	primarily	for	the	purpose	of	attaining
some	understanding	of	Being.	He	later	gave	up	this
approach	 because	 he	 felt	 that	 any	 active
investigation	 would	 defeat	 itself	 and	 that	 an
attitude	of	passive	openness	is	required	for	Being
to	 manifest	 itself,	 a	 form	 of	 meditative—as
opposed	to	calculative—	thinking.	He	claimed	that
certain	 poets,	 such	 as	 Holderlin,	 gathered	 in	 the
manifestations	of	Being	and	proclaimed	“the	Holy”
(Richardson	1974).	Existentialists	ignored	all	this
and	concentrated	on	Dasein	and	human	freedom,
emphasizing	 that	 humans	 could	 make	 their	 own
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
263
essence	and	were	not	born	with	some	sort	of	fixed
nature.	Psychotherapists	have	not	given	sufficient
thought	 to	 how	 their	 assumptions	 on	 this	 issue
affect	their	approach	to	patients	(Chessick	1992).

DEATH	INSTINCT
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
264
The	first	draft	of	Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle
was	 completed	 in	 May	 1919	 by	 the	 63-year-old
Freud	during	a	period	of	famine	and	deprivation.
Although	Austria	was	impoverished	and	ruined	by
World	 War	 I	 and	 its	 aftermath,	 Freud	 seemed	 to
experience	 a	 resurgence	 of	 his	 creative	 powers.
From	the	clinical	manifestations	of	the	repetition
compulsion	he	evolved	a	biological	metatheory	of
the	life	and	death	instincts.	The	death	instinct	was
a	 silent	 force,	 and	 biological	 phenomena	 of	 the
most	
diverse	
sort	
were	
all	
explained	
as
manifestations	 of	 its	 striving	 to	 restore	 the
inorganic	state	from	which	life	had	emerged.	Life
was	maintained	against	this	force	by	the	opposing
power	 of	 Eros.	 The	 death	 instinct	 was	 seldom
invoked	in	a	clinical	context	except	to	account	for
unusual	 states	 of	 instinctual	 “defusion,”	 when
destructive	 energies	 could	 be	 observed	 in	 “pure
culture”	 (Freud	 1923).	 In	 Beyond	 the	 Pleasure
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org

Principle,	 Freud	 (1920)	 delineates	 a	 certain
symmetry	between	Eros	and	the	death	instinct	but
leaves	 the	 impression	 that	 the	 death	 instinct	 is
more	powerful.
Freud	 elaborated	 on	 the	 death	 instinct	 in
subsequent	writings	(1927,	1930,	1933a,b,	1940),
postulating	 the	 drive	 source	 of	 aggression	 to	 be
the	death	instinct	turned	outwards.	In	Civilization
and	Its	Discontents,	he	(1930)	added	the	important
clinical	point	that	when	the	death	instinct	emerges
without	any	sexual	purpose	“in	the	blindest	fury	of
destructiveness,	 we	 cannot	 fail	 to	 recognize	 that
the	satisfaction	of	the	instinct	is	accompanied	by
an	 extraordinarily	 high	 degree	 of	 narcissistic
enjoyment,	owing	to	its	presenting	the	ego	with	a
fulfillment	
of	
the	
latter’s	
old	
wishes	
for
omnipotence”	(p.	121).	In	the	same	publication	he
switches	 to	 a	 different	 language,	 poetically
envisioning	the	evolution	of	civilization	as	a	result
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
266
of	the	“battle	of	the	giants”	(p.	122),	a	struggle	for
the	life	of	the	human	species	between	Eros	and	the
death	instinct.
Three	years	later,	Freud	(1933b)	wrote,	“The
theory	of	the	instincts	is	so	to	say	our	mythology.
Instincts	are	mythical	entities,	magnificent	in	their
indefiniteness.	 In	 our	 work	 we	 cannot	 for	 a
moment	 disregard	 them,	 yet	 we	 are	 never	 sure
that	we	are	seeing	them	clearly”	(p.	95).	But	here,
using	 the	 language	 of	 metapsychology,	 Freud
specifically	 characterizes	 the	 death	 instinct	 as
primary	masochism	and	points	out	that	it	seems	to
be	necessary	for	us	to	destroy	some	other	thing	or
person	in	order	not	to	destroy	ourselves,	so	as	to
guard	 against	 our	 primary	 impulse	 to	 self-
destruction.	In	that	same	year	Freud	(1933a),	now
77	 years	 old,	 wrote	 to	 Einstein	 depicting	 this
impulse	as	striving	to	bring	every	living	creature
to	ruin	and	to	reduce	life	to	its	original	condition
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
267
of	inanimate	matter.	In	his	(1940)	final	writing	on
the	 death	 instinct	 he	 proposes	 an	 additional
dualism,	 contrasting	 individual	 death,	 which
occurs	through	some	portion	of	the	death	instinct
remaining	 permanently	 within	 until	 at	 length	 it
succeeds	in	doing	the	individual	to	death,	with	the
death	of	the	species,	which	dies	of	an	unsuccessful
struggle	against	the	world	because	it	cannot	adapt
to	external	changes.
The	 ambiguity	 of	 Freud’s	 concept	 appears	 in
the	 shifting	 emphasis	 on	 different	 aspects	 of	 it.
Primary	
masochism	
implies	
a	
fundamental
aggressive	
drive	
component,	
with	
the
destructiveness	 originally	 turned	 inward	 and
actively	directed	against	the	organism	itself.	More
mysteriously,	a	conservative	force	that	wishes	to
bring	 the	 organism	 to	 die	 in	 its	 own	 fashion
implies	a	less	directly	destructive	aspect;	it	tones
down	 the	 aggressive	 component	 and	 envisions	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
268
sort	 of	 magnetic	 force,	 pulling	 the	 organism	 to	 a
natural	 disintegration	 and	 death	 in	 a	 quieter
manner,	although	this	may	be	a	very	powerful	pull
indeed.	 But	 usually	 it	 is	 the	 primary	 masochism
aspect	that	is	emphasized	as	the	source	of	human
aggression	and	destructiveness.
One	 difficulty	 in	 accepting	 the	 death	 instinct
may	 be	 traced	 to	 Freud’s	 (1915)	 contention	 that
“our	 unconscious	 …	 does	 not	 believe	 in	 its	 own
death”	 (p.	 296),	 because	 we	 cling	 in	 our
unconscious	to	archaic	beliefs	in	immortality	and
omnipotence.	 Recently,	 however,	 Litman	 (Brooks
1988)	disagreed	with	Freud’s	contention,	claiming
it	 is	 contradicted	 by	 the	 dreams	 of	 suicidal
patients;	furthermore,	none	of	the	presenters	at	a
psychoanalytic	
meeting	
on	
this	
topic
“conceptualized	 masochism	 as	 resulting	 from	 a
purely	 instinctual	 need	 of	 the	 masochist	 or	 as	 a
particular	 vicissitude	 of	 the	 aggressive	 drive”	 (p.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
269
20).
In	Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle,	Freud	(1920)
defines	an	instinct	as	“an	urge	inherent	in	organic
life	 to	 restore	 an	 earlier	 state	 of	 things”	 (p.	 36).
After	 reflecting	 rhetorically	 on	 “the	 mysterious
masochistic	 trends	 of	 the	 ego”	 (p.	 14),	 he	 later
concludes,	“It	is	as	though	the	life	of	the	organism
moved	 with	 a	 vacillating	 rhythm.	 One	 group	 of
instincts	 rushes	 forward	 so	 as	 to	 reach	 the	 final
aim	 of	 life	 as	 swiftly	 as	 possible;	 but	 when	 a
particular	stage	in	the	advance	has	been	reached,
the	 other	 group	 jerks	 back	 to	 a	 certain	 point	 to
make	a	fresh	start	and	so	prolong	the	journey”	(pp.
40-41).
A	more	definitive	statement	occurs	in	Section	4
of	 Freud’s	 (1923)	 The	 Ego	 and	 the	 Id.	 Here	 he
sometimes	refers	to	the	death	instinct	as	a	“class
of	 instincts”	 (p.	 40)	 that	 he	 calls	 “the	 death
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
270
instincts”	 (p.	 46),	 and	 he	 declares	 that	 sadism	 is
the	 representative	 of	 the	 death	 instincts.	 He
explains	 that	 the	 “death	 instincts	 are	 by	 their
nature	 mute”	 (p.	 46)	 and	 discusses	 the	 various
clinical	phenomena	that	appear	as	the	two	classes
of	 instincts	 fuse	 with	 each	 other	 or	 regressively
defuse.	 In	 melancholia,	 however,	 “What	 is	 now
holding	sway	in	the	superego	is	...	a	pure	culture	of
the	death	instinct”	(p.	53).	Finally,	in	An	Outline	of
Psychoanalysis,	 Freud	 (1940),	 now	 84	 years	 old,
alternately	 uses	 the	 term	 “destructive	 instinct”
and	“death	instinct”	to	refer	to	the	same	group	of
basic	 instincts	 in	 contrast	 to	 the	 Eros	 group.	 He
adds,
So	 long	 as	 that	 instinct	 operates	 internally,
as	a	death	instinct,	it	remains	silent;	it	only
conies	 to	 our	 notice	 when	 it	 is	 diverted
outwards	 as	 an	 instinct	 of	 destruction.	 It
seems	to	be	essential	for	the	preservation	of
the	 individual	 that	 this	 diversion	 should
occur;	 the	 muscular	 apparatus	 serves	 this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
271
purpose.	 When	 the	 superego	 is	 established,
considerable	 amounts	 of	 the	 aggressive
instinct	are	fixated	in	the	interior	of	the	ego
and	operate	there	self-destructively.	[p.	150]
Here	Freud’s	thinking	seems	clear;	he	is	thinking
of	 the	 death	 instinct	 as	 a	 destructive,	 aggressive,
sadistic	 assault	 on	 the	 organism	 that	 may	 be
diverted	 outward	 or	 stored	 in	 the	 superego.	 The
silent	
pull	
toward	
the	
inorganic	
state	
is
deemphasized.
Yet	Freud	in	this	work	also	writes,
The	core	of	our	being,	then,	is	formed	by	the
obscure	
id,	
which	
has	
no	
direct
communication	with	the	external	world	and
is	 accessible	 even	 to	 our	 own	 knowledge
only	through	the	medium	of	another	agency.
Within	 this	 id	 the	 organic	 instincts	 operate,
which	 are	 themselves	 compounded	 of
fusions	 of	 two	 primal	 forces	 (Eros	 and
destructiveness)	 in	 varying	 proportions,	 [p.
197]
Here	two	mysterious	primal	forces	again	appear,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
272
which,	when	fused	in	various	degrees,	make	up	the
biological	
instincts.	
Similarly,	
in	
Analysis
Terminable	 and	 Interminable,	
Freud	
(1937)
denotes	 the	 “instinct	 of	 aggression	 or	 of
destruction	 according	 to	 its	 aims,	 and	 which	 we
trace	 back	 to	 the	 original	 death	 instinct	 of	 living
matter”	(p.	243).	In	this	paper	he	cites	the	Greek
philosopher	 Empedocles	 and	 refers	 to	 Eros	 and
the	death	instinct	as	“primal	instincts,”	leaving	it
ambiguous	 as	 to	 whether	 and	 how	 the	 primal
instincts	or	forces	generate	secondary	instincts	or
derivatives,	and	implying	some	sort	of	hierarchy	of
instincts	or	forces.
This	 ambiguity	 pervades	 Freud’s	 thinking,	 as
evidenced	 in	 his	 (1933a)	 letter	 to	 Einstein	 in
which	he	writes,	“The	death	instinct	turns	into	the
destructive	instinct	when,	with	the	help	of	special
organs,	 it	 is	 directed	 outwards,	 onto	 objects”	 (p.
211).	In	this	letter,	Freud	says	the	death	instinct
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
273
strives	 to	 reduce	 life	 to	 its	 original	 condition	 of
inanimate	 matter;	 furthermore,	 some	 portion	 of
the	death	instinct,	even	when	part	of	it	is	turned
outward	 and	 made	 into	 the	 destructive	 instinct,
“remains	operative	within	the	organism”	(Freud’s
emphasis).	 Freud	 again	 refers	 to	 his	 theory	 of
primal	instincts	as	“a	kind	of	mythology”	(p.	211).
As	 Jones	 (1957)	 points	 out,	 “These	 principles	 or
instincts	 were	 by	 now	 assuming	 something	 of	 a
transcendental	 significance”	 (p.	 275)	 for	 Freud.
Indeed,	 Freud’s	 (1937)	 contrast	 between	 the
“cosmic	 phantasy”	 of	 Empedocles	 and	 his	 own
theory	 claiming	 “biological	 validity”	 mentioned
above	seems	to	collapse.
This	became	an	important	source	of	error.	The
concept	of	primal	instincts	can	only	be	adduced	in
a	theoretical	context	since	it	is	a	metaphysical	or
transcendental	 concept;	 when	 concretized	 it
becomes,	 unfortunately,	 akin	 to	 “vitalism”	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
274
biology	(Gedo	1986).	No	evidence	of	a	clinical	or
empirical	 nature	 could	 serve	 to	 either	 decisively
establish	or	disprove	the	existence	of	such	primal
instincts,	which	are	of	a	different	epistemological
order.	Some	writers	have	even	suggested	that	the
sudden	 death	 of	 one	 of	 Freud’s	 daughters,	 the
onset	of	his	cancer,	and	the	death	of	his	favorite
grandson	were	sources	for	Freud’s	preoccupation
with	the	death	instinct,	but	it	has	been	established
that	Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle	was	drafted	in
1919,	 several	 months	 before	 the	 first	 of	 these
events	 and	 four	 years	 before	 the	 other	 two	 (Gay
1988,	Jones	1957).	Still,	as	Gay	(p.	395)	points	out,
the	term	“death	drive”	entered	his	correspondence
a	 week	 after	 the	 death	 of	 his	 daughter.	 Surely
these	 events	 influenced	 Freud’s	 elevation	 of	 the
death	instinct	to	a	primal	force	and	his	coming	to
regard	it	as	a	“fact.”
It	 is	 often	 overlooked	 that	 the	 theory	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
275
primal	 instincts,	 as	 Bibring	 (1941)	 explains,	 was
founded	 on	 an	 essentially	 changed	 concept	 of
instinct:
According	to	it,	instinct	was	not	a	tension	of
energy	 which	 impinged	 upon	 the	 mental
sphere,	which	arose	from	an	organic	source
and	 which	 aimed	 at	 removing	 a	 state	 of
excitation	 in	 the	 organ	 from	 which	 it
originated.	 It	 was	 a	 directive	 or	 directed
“something”	which	guided	the	life	processes
in	 a	 certain	 direction.	 The	 accent	 was	 no
longer	 upon	 the	 production	 of	 energy	 but
only	 upon	 the	 function	 of	 determining	 a
direction,	[p.	128]
What	results	is	an	ambiguous	and	vague	concept
of	 “the	 death	 instincts	 which	 seek	 to	 cancel	 out
tensions,	 the	 instincts	 of	 destruction	 at	 work
within,	 aggressiveness	 directed	 outwards,	 the
trend	toward	a	state	of	rest	(the	Nirvana	principle)
and	 the	 inclination	 to	 suffer”	 (pp.	 129-130)	 all
forming	 a	 related	 group,	 in	 contrast	 to	 the	 life
instincts.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
276
As	 I	 have	 discussed	 in	 detail	 elsewhere	 (see
Chessick	 1992),	 by	 the	 death	 instinct	 concept
Freud	was	trying	to	link	the	tendency	toward	the
reduction	 of	 tension	 within	 the	 organism,
masochistic	 and	 sadistic	 clinical	 phenomena,	 the
repetition	 compulsion,	 the	 conservative	 trend
toward	 a	 state	 of	 rest,	 sleep,	 and	 death,	 the
amazing	 inclination	 for	 suffering	 and	 self-
destruction	 seen	 in	 severe	 melancholias,	 and
perhaps	his	own	personal	agonies	(cancer	and	the
loss	of	his	loved	ones).	It	was	conceived	during	the
European	self-destructive	horror	of	World	War	1
and	its	aftermath	that	brought	nineteenth-century
optimism	to	an	end,	as	Nietzsche	had	predicted.	In
fact,	 there	 is	 a	 distinct	 echo	 of	 Nietzsche	 to	 be
found	in	Freud’s	(1919)	paper	on	“The	‘Uncanny,’	”
published	 in	 the	 year	 he	 drafted	 Beyond	 the
Pleasure	 Principle,	 in	 which	 he	 refers	 to	 “the
constant	 recurrence	 of	 the	 same	 thing”	 (p.	 234)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
277
and	 the	 “daemonic	 character”	 (p.	 238)	 of	 certain
aspects	of	the	mind.

DEFENSE,
DEFENSE	MECHANISMS
(see	EGO)
DEFUSION
In	classical	psychoanalytic	metapsychology	the
energy	of	the	aggressive	instinct	is	fused	with	that
of	 the	 sexual	 instinct	 to	 provide	 neutralized
energy	 the	 ego	 uses	 for	 its	 purposes,	 such	 as
operating	 the	 mechanisms	 of	 defense.	 When	 an
individual	 regresses,	 this	 unification,	 fusion,	 and
organization	 crumble.	 The	 result	 is	 a	 freedom	 of
the	destructive	and	sexual	instincts	in	their	raw	or
archaic	 form,	 which	 often	 leads	 the	 patient	 into
trouble.	 According	 to	 the	 structural	 theory,
defused	or	“neutralized”	energy	is	also	used	by	the
superego.	 The	 notion	 of	 fusion	 and	 defusion	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
280
instincts	has	a	wide	variety	of	clinical	applications
in	 traditional	 psychoanalytic	 metapsychological
theory.	Details	may	be	found	in	Nagera	(1970).

DENIAL,
DISAVOWAL,
NEGATION
“Denial”	 is	 a	 defense	 mechanism	 used	 by	 the
ego	to	vitiate	a	painful	experience	or	aspect	of	the
self.	 In	 Kleinian	 theory	 it	 is	 often	 followed	 by
splitting	 and	 projection,	 which	 reinforce	 the
denial.	 A	 denial	 of	 psychic	 reality	 may	 also	 be
found	 in	 the	 classical	 Kleinian	 notion	 of	 a	 manic
defense	 against	 depressive	 feelings.	 Denial	 is
different	 from	 negation	 in	 that	 in	 the	 latter	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
281
perception	 is	 still	 present	 and	 experienced	 but
accompanied	by	an	assertion	of	its	negative.
Denial	 operates	 unconsciously	 to	 resolve
emotional	 conflict	 and	 remove	 the	 anxiety	 signal
by	 a	 mechanism	 of	 disavowing	 those	 thoughts,
feelings,	 wishes,	 needs,	 or	 reality	 factors	 that
would	 otherwise	 be	 intolerable	 to	 the	 conscious
mind	 of	 the	 individual.	 Disavowal	 and	 denial	 are
often	used	interchangeably	and	as	translations	of
the	 term	 Verleugnung.	The	 use	 of	 disavowal	 was
emphasized	 first	 in	 Freud’s	 concept	 of	 the	 little
boy’s	“denial,”	even	after	he	sees	a	naked	girl,	that
there	are	any	people	who	have	no	penis.	Later	he
(1927)	 used	 disavowal	 especially	 to	 understand
the	 case	 of	 fetishism.	 In	 a	 very	 late	 paper,	 he
(1940a)	introduced	the	notion	of	a	splitting	of	the
ego	in	order	to	cast	a	clearer	light	on	the	concept
of	disavowal.	This	is	also	mentioned	in	his	(1940b)
final	unfinished	work.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
282
Nicholson-Smith	(1973),	in	a	translator’s	note,
points	out	that	although	Verleugnung	is	still	widely
translated	 as	 “denial,”	 he	 has	 followed	 the
recommendations	 of	 the	 editors	 of	 the	 Standard
Edition	 and	 has	 used	 “disavowal”	 to	 resolve	 an
ambiguity	in	these	words	(p.	120).	Regardless	of
the	 semantic	 details,	 the	 importance	 of	 denial	 or
disavowal	 in	 clinical	 work	 is	 paramount.	 I	 am
inclined	 to	 use	 denial	 as	 an	 unconscious
mechanism,	 while	 disavowal	 has	 more	 of	 a
preconscious	 quality	 in	 my	 clinical	 thinking	 and
can	 be	 more	 easily	 brought	 to	 the	 patient’s
consciousness.	 This	 is	 consistent	 with	 Kohut’s
(1971)	 notion	 of	 a	 “vertical	 split”	 (see	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY),	 which	 I	 believe	 is	 also	 a	 form	 of
disavowal.	 Negation,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 is	 a
conscious	statement	of	a	perception	accompanied
by	 a	 negative	 term.	 Thus,	 for	 example,	 a	 patient
claims,	“I	absolutely	never	had	any	wish	to	see	my
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
283
sister	naked.”

DEPRESSION
It	is	interesting	that	the	psychological	sense	of
this	 word	 is	 not	 given	 in	 Samuel	 Johnson’s
dictionary.	In	psychiatry	depression	can	be	either
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
284
an	 emotional	 state	 or	 a	 diagnosis;	 the	 current
usage,	characteristics,	and	classifications	are	listed
in	DSM-III-R.	The	classical	psychoanalytic	attempt
to	 understand	 depression	 was	 made	 by	 Freud
(1917)	 in	 “Mourning	 and	 Melancholia.”	 It	 should
be	kept	in	mind	that	in	that	paper	Freud	explained
he	 was	 attempting	 to	 understand	 only	 a	 limited
subgroup	 of	 patients	 with	 manifestations	 of
depression.	 He	 left	 room	 for	 other	 varieties,	 as
well	 as	 for	 the	 possibility	 of	 depressions	 on	 an
organic	or	biochemical	basis.
Any	psychotherapist	confronted	by	significant
depression	today	has	the	obligation	to	assess	the
patient	 for	 antidepressant	 medication.	 This	 is	 a
malpractice	issue,	but	the	psychotherapist	should
not	feel	that	the	use	of	antidepressant	medication
is	mandatory.	Judicious	use	of	medication	in	this
situation	is	required,	as	in	any	medical	condition.
Psychotherapists	
who	
are	
not	
thoroughly
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
285
conversant	
with	
the	
large	
variety	
of
antidepressant	medications	on	the	market,	or	who
have	no	medical	training	that	would	enable	them
to	deal	with	the	side	effects	of	these	medications,
should	not	take	the	responsibility	of	administering
them.	 In	 my	 clinical	 experience	 there	 is	 a
substantial	qualitative	and	quantitative	difference
between	 the	 kind	 of	 depression	 one	 sees	 in
neurotic	 outpatients	 and	 the	 deep	 melancholias
that	are	treated	in	hospitals.
Freud’s	 viewpoint	 was	 that	 depression	 arises
when	 an	 ambivalently	 loved	 object	 is	 lost.	 The
loved	 part	 of	 the	 object	 is	 introjected	 into	 the
superego	 and	 the	 hated	 part	 into	 the	 ego;	 the
superego	then	chastises	the	ego	and	the	individual
feels	 the	 emotional	 experience	 of	 melancholia.
Moore	and	Fine	(1990)	view	the	breakdown	of	the
regulation	 of	 self-esteem	 as	 perhaps	 a	 universal
feature	in	depression.	This	may	result	from	“loss
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
286
of	
an	
object	
by	
death,	
hurt,	
neglect,	
or
disappointment.	
Other	
causes	
include
disillusionment	over	an	idealized	cause,	failure	to
live	up	to	ego	ideals,	or	a	sense	of	helplessness	and
powerlessness	in	the	face	of	insurmountable	odds”
(p.	 53).	 One	 sees	 from	 this	 current	 official
psychoanalytic	 definition	 the	 considerable	 shift
from	and	enlargement	of	the	early	formulations	of
depression	 and	 the	 emphasis	 on	 preexisting
narcissism	or	narcissistic	disorders.
There	 is	 a	 vast	 literature	 on	 depression.	 For
example,	 Jacobson	 (1971)	 claims	 that	 aggression
is	 a	 crucial	 result	 of	 the	 infant’s	 experience	 of
helplessness.	 She	 views	 ambivalence	 as	 arising
from	 this	 and	 sees	 it	 as	 central	 to	 the
predisposition	 to	 depression.	 The	 lack	 of	 the
mother’s	empathy,	she	explains,	lowers	the	child’s
self-esteem	 and	 produces	 aggressive	 conflicts.
Frustration	 leads	 to	 rage,	 which	 leads	 to

image,	 with	 the	 resultant	 loss	 of	 self-esteem,	 a
conflict	 between	 the	 wishful	 self	 and	 the	 failing,
depleted	self.	This	leads	to	the	mood	expressed	in
depression,	 an	 intersystemic	 conflict	 whose
severity	depends	on	the	intensity	of	the	hostility
and	the	severity	and	duration	of	disappointment.
Milrod	 (1988)	 views	 the	 simplest	 depression
as	arising	from	a	narcissistic	injury	in	which	there
is	a	gap	between	the	view	of	the	self	and	the	image
of	what	one	wishes	to	be.	The	self	representation
falls	 to	 critical	 levels	 below	 the	 wished-for	 self-
image.	 Narcissistic	 supplies	 from	 the	 ego	 are	 cut
off,	and	libidinal	cathexis	of	the	self	representation
is	replaced	by	a	hostile	cathexis,	instigated	by	the
self-critical	function	of	the	ego:	“1	am	a	failure.”	In
a	 second	 type	 of	 depression,	 as	 described	 by
Milrod,	the	self	representation	falls	short	of	ethical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
288
values.	Here	there	is	guilt,	and	the	superego	cuts
off	libidinal	cathexis	and	replaces	it	with	a	hostile
cathexis	 of	 the	 self	 representation.	 Depression
results	if	it	becomes	a	mood	state:	“I	am	bad	and
deserve	to	be	punished.”	This	is	intersystemic,	in
contrast	to	the	former	type	of	depression	Milrod
describes,	which	is	intrasystemic.
In	 formulating	 a	 third	 type	 of	 depression,
Milrod	says	that	the	ambivalently	loved	object	is	a
source	of	narcissistic	supply	and	is	essential	to	the
individual.	 Loss	 of	 this	 object	 or	 its	 love
precipitates	the	depression.	Milrod	argues	that	so-
called	morality	in	depression	is	restitutive	and	not
fundamental	and	disagrees	with	Brenner’s	(1982)
view	of	depression	as	a	basic	affect.	For	Brenner,
depression	 is	 a	 signal,	 whereas	 for	 Milrod,	 it
emerges	out	of	conflict	and	is	not	a	signal.	Instead,
the	diminished	sense	of	self-worth	is	fundamental.
Depression	follows	a	narcissistic	blow,	which,	if	it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
289
evolves	to	a	mood	state,	can	be	a	clinical	problem.
If	 it	 does	 not	 evolve,	 it	 is	 felt	 as	 self-criticism,
which	can	be	constructive.	Aggression	lies	beneath
all	depressive	states.	Such	depressive	states	can	be
defended	 against	 by	 self-hate,	 denial,	 projection,
elation,	 obsessional	 activity	 to	 bind	 the	 hostility,
obsessional	 character	 formation,	 self-pity,	 and	 a
veering	of	aggression	off	to	the	world,	giving	the
patient	a	paranoid	flavor.
Davis	(1976)	wisely	refers	to	Bibring’s	(1953)
concept	of	the	state	of	helplessness	as	the	starting
point	in	depression.	This	helplessness	is	from	the
ego’s	 sense	 of	 powerlessness	 and	 failure	 against
superior	 powers	 and	 of	 being	 doomed	 to	 the
“inescapable	 fate	 of	 being	 lonely,	 isolated,	 or
unloved”	 (p.	 23).	 There	 is	 an	 affect	 of	 emptiness
like	hunger,	due	to	a	narcissistic	wound.	An	inner
pressure	 to	 work	 and	 fight	 on	 prevails,	 although
the	patient	would	rather	rest	passively;	the	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
290
must	 live	 up	 to	 the	 demands	 of	 strongly	 held
narcissistic	 aspirations.	 Davis	 deemphasizes	 the
role	of	anger	and	focuses	on	a	rapid	and	sudden
narcissistic	 wounding	 as	 most	 causative	 in
depression.
Stone	 (1986)	 emphasizes	 the	 preeminent
importance	 of	 an	 archaic	 characterologic	 core	 in
depression	 manifesting	 pathological	 narcissism,
ambivalent	 morality,	 and	 a	 sadistic	 superego.
Depression	 is	 frequently	 precipitated	 by	 a
narcissistic	 wound	 in	 a	 patient	 who	 has	 a	 rigid
ego-ideal	 and	 cannot	 modify	 his	 or	 her	 goals	 or
give	them	up.	The	patient	cannot	adapt	to	failure
without	disastrous	loss	of	self-esteem.	There	is	a
rigid	maladaptive	pursuit	of	certain	goals	due	not
only	to	the	ego-ideal	but	to	narcissistic	aggressive
components	 in	 the	 original	 ambitious	 thrust,
which	 adds	 an	 obstinate	 and	 uncompromising
quality	to	the	patient’s	activities.	All	these	factors
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
291
operate	 synergistically	 along	 with	 an	
oral
aggressive	 impatience,	 a	 narcissistic	 grandiose
self,	a	sensitivity	to	criticism,	an	undue	readiness
for	 severe	 disappointment,	 and	 an	 unbridgeable
gulf	between	the	acceptance	of	defeat	and	reality.

DEPRESSIVE	POSITION
This	 term	 is	 included	 here	 to	 differentiate	 it
from	“depression,”	with	which	it	is	often	confused.
A	 thorough	 treatment	 of	 it	 may	 be	 found	 in
Hinshelwood	(1989).	Briefly,	according	to	Melanie
Klein	(1975),	this	position	is	reached	around	the
fourth	month	of	life	and	is	gradually	overcome	in
the	course	of	the	first	year,	although	it	may	recur
at	any	time	when	losses	occur.	It	is	ushered	in	by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
293
the	 development	 of	 the	 cognitive	 capacity	 of	 the
infant	 to	 perceive	 the	 mother	 as	 a	 whole	 object,
making	it	harder	to	split	and	project	parts	of	the
mother	 or	 to	 incorporate	 projected	 parts	 once
more,	 as	 is	 characteristic	 of	 the	 earlier	 or
“paranoid”	position.	Libidinal	and	hostile	instincts
are	 now	 focused	 on	 the	 same	 object,	 leading	 to
depressive	anxiety	caused	by	the	possibility	of	the
infant	annihilating	and	destroying	the	mother	as	a
result	 of	 sadistic	 impulses	 toward	 her.	 Various
defenses	 are	 constructed	 against	 this	 anxiety,
according	 to	 Klein,	 either	 manic	 defenses	 or	 the
deflection	or	inhibition	of	the	sadism.
Later	 in	 life,	 when	 there	 are	 inevitable	 object
losses,	 this	 depressive	 anxiety	 is	 reactivated	 and
the	 depressive	 position	 is	 worked	 through	 once
more.	According	to	Klein,	this	may	lead	to	either	a
failure	in	working	through	and	a	regression	back
to	 the	 paranoid	 position	 (see	 KLEIN)	 or	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
294
successful	 reworking	 with	 even	 maturation	 and
improvement	 in	 the	 individual’s	 functioning.	 The
classic	paper	in	which	Melanie	Klein	outlined	the
depressive	 position	 may	 be	 found	 in	 her	 (1975)

DESIRE
In	contrast	to	the	simple	definition	by	Samuel
Johnson	 (1773)	 of	 	 “desire”	 as	 an	 “eagerness	 to
obtain	or	enjoy,”	this	term	in	the	hands	of	Hegel
and	 subsequently	 Lacan	 attained	 considerable
importance.	Johnson	quotes	John	Locke	as	saying,
“Desire	 is	 the	 uneasiness	 a	 man	 finds	 in	 himself
upon	 the	 absence	 of	 any	 thing,	 whose	 present
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
296
enjoyment	 carries	 the	 idea	 of	 delight	 with	 it”	 (p.
520).
It	 is	 in	 Hegel’s	 (1807)	 original	 conception	 of
the	evolution	of	self-consciousness	that	we	come
across	the	more	modern	technical	concept	of	the
desiring	 mind.	 In	 Hegel’s	 view,	 “To	 desire
something	is	to	wish	to	possess	it—and	thus	not	to
destroy	it	altogether—but	also	to	transform	it	into
something	that	is	yours,	and	thus	to	strip	it	of	its
foreignness”	(Singer	1983,	p.	57).	For	Hegel,	self-
consciousness	cannot	exist	in	isolation	and	needs
an	object	from	which	to	differentiate	itself.	Desire
arises	
because	
self-consciousness	
needs	
an
external	 object;	 thus	 desire	 is	 an	 unsatisfactory
state	for	self-consciousness.	Self-consciousness	is
doomed	 to	 be	 permanently	 unsatisfied	 and	 its
object,	 according	 to	 Hegel,	 must	 be	 another	 self-
consciousness.	 In	 language	 that	 is	 not	 technical,
this	is	a	way	of	saying	that	in	order	to	see	oneself,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
297
one	needs	a	mirror.	Furthermore,	Hegel	contends
that	 self-consciousness	 requires	 the	 context	 of
social	 interaction	 and	 could	 never	 develop	 in	 a
child	 growing	 up	 in	 total	 isolation.	 Whether	 this
explication	is	what	Hegel	had	in	mind	in	his	murky
prose	remains	controversial	in	the	literature;	what
is	 significant	 is	 that	 the	 intimate	 relationship
between	 one’s	 self-consciousness	 and	 that	 self-
consciousness	of	the	other	is	at	the	center	of	the
definition	of	the	desire	that	was	adopted	by	Lacan
(1977).	 Even	 Ricoeur	 (1940)	 relabeled	 Freud’s
psychoanalysis	as	the	“semantics	of	desire.”
Lacanians	 (see	 LACAN)	 think	 of	 desire	 as
arising	from	the	primordial	“demand	of	the	brute,”
when	the	separation	from	the	mother	occurs	and
human	
self-consciousness	
develops.	
For
Lacanians,	desire	is	to	be	the	desired	of	the	other,
a	rough	approximation	of	what	Hegel	had	in	mind
in	 his	 discussion	 of	 the	 evolution	 of	 self-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
298
consciousness.	 Since	 initially	 the	 infant	 subject
wishes	 to	 be	 the	 object	 of	 the	 mother’s	 desire,
Lacan	uses	the	phallus	as	the	signifier	of	that	basic
desire	that	arises	out	of	the	primary	split	between
mother	and	infant:	“In	order	to	insure	himself	of
his	mother’s	presence	and	her	complete	affective
support,	the	child	unconsciously	seeks	to	be	that
which	 can	 best	 gratify	 her.	 He	 seeks	 to	 make
himself	exclusively	indispensable”	(Lemaire	1977,
p.	87).

DIALOGUE,
DIALOGISM
(BAKHTIN)
Holquist	 (1990)	 claims	 that	 Bakhtin	 (1895-
1975)	 never	 used	 the	 term	 “dialogism,”	 but	 this
master	 thinker,	 who	 led	 a	 harsh	 life	 under	 the
Soviet	system,	continued	in	spite	of	it	all	to	think
and	rethink	the	nature	of	dialogue.	For	him	the	self
and	the	other	exist	not	as	separate	entities	but	in	a
dialogic	 relationship	 at	 a	 particular	 moment	 in
space	 and	 time,	 a	 sort	 of	 relativistic	 self-
psychology.	 As	 illustrated	 best	 in	 Dostoevsky’s
novels,	he	believed,	the	self	is	a	triad:	a	center,	a
not-center,	 and	 the	 relation	 between	 them.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
300
Similarly,	a	dialogue	is	composed	of	an	utterance,
a	 reply,	 and	 the	 relation	 between	 the	 two.	 The
latter	is	the	most	important,	because	without	it	the
utterance	 and	 the	 reply	 would	 have	 no	 meaning.
This	 makes	 the	 self	 of	 the	 analyst	 of	 coequal
importance	in	determining	the	meaning	and	shape
of	 the	 dialogue	 with	 the	 patient,	 and	 even	 in
determining	 the	 “self’	 of	 the	 patient	 as	 it	 is
experienced	by	the	analyst,	and	vice	versa.
An	important	issue	is	presented	by	the	noted
Bakhtin	scholar	Todorov	(1992):	whether	human
existence	is	or	is	not	originally	social	and	whether
or	not	it	can	be	reduced	to	its	biological	dimension
without	being	deprived	of	the	characteristics	that
make	it	human.	Bakhtin	(1989),	in	his	“dialogism”
theory	takes	an	extreme	view	in	which	he	sees	the
human	 personality	 as	 entirely	 produced	 by	 the
social	 whole.	 When	 Todorov	 says	 that	 Bakhtin
(contrary	to	Freud)	conceives	of	the	unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
301
as	not	preceding	language,	he	is	stating	the	same
thesis	as	that	held	by	Lacan.
Another	 crucial	 issue	 in	 Todorov’s	 review	 of
Bakhtin’s	theories	is	whether	the	“utterances”	(as
Bakhtin	calls	them,	to	emphasize	the	social	nature
of	 discourse)	 that	 constitute	 the	 transference	 in
the	 psychoanalytic	 dialogue	 are	 a	 product	 of	 the
present	 and	 current	 situation	 between	 therapist
and	patient	or	whether	the	transference,	as	Arlow
(1985)	in	the	extreme	opposite	view	would	say,	is
the	attempt	on	the	part	of	the	patient	to	impose	a
reenactment	of	an	infantile	fantasy	on	the	patient-
analyst	 relationship.	 My	 position	 is	 that	 it	 is
probably	a	varying	combination	of	both	depending
on	 the	 patient,	 the	 analyst,	 and	 the	 phase	 of
analysis	they	are	in,	and	that	would	separate	my
view	from	the	view	of	Bakhtin.
Todorov	 says	 that	 according	 to	 Bakhtin,	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
302
psychological	 approaches	 of	 Dostoevsky	 and
Freud	 are	 incompatible.	 I	 do	 not	 know	 whether
Bakhtin	 actually	 believed	 this	 or	 not,	 but	 Freud
(1929)	 recognized	 Dostoevsky	 to	 be	 the	 great
psychologist	he	certainly	was,	and	in	rereading	his
two	major	novels	(1990,	1992)	one	certainly	can
become	 even	 more	 directly	 aware,	 especially	 in
the	 wonderful,	 newly	 available	 translations,	 of
Dostoevsky’s	capacity	to	plumb	the	psychological
depths	 of	 his	 characters.	 Freud	 did	 not	 like
Dostoevsky	personally	(he	said	he	had	enough	of
neurotics	in	his	consulting	room)	and	he	disagreed
with	 Dostoevsky’s	 moral	 solutions,	 but	 he
recognized	Dostoevsky’s	creative	genius	and	deep
intuitive	 insight	 into	 neurotics	 and	 character
disorders.
If	Bakhtin	says,	as	Todorov	(1992)	insists,	“At
the	 bottom	 of	 man	 we	 find	 not	 the	 Id	 but	 the
other,”	 (p.	 33),	 many	 psychoanalysts	 would
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
303
respond	that	we	cannot	separate	the	Id	from	the
other,	thus	holding	a	kind	of	intermediate	position
not	so	far	from	Klein.	Klein	pointed	out	over	and
over	again	that	the	infant’s	aggressive	drives	were
projected	 and	 then	 reintrojected,	 so	 that	 there
occurs	 quickly	 in	 life	 a	 continual	 intrapsychic
confusion	 between	 what	 constitutes	 the	 original
aggressive	 drives	 and	 what	 constitutes	 the
projected	
and	
reintrojected	
object
representations.	 This	 poses	 a	 problem	 that	 one
encounters	 clinically	 all	 the	 time	 and	 that	 I	 find
quite	baffling,	to	the	point	where	I	have	ceased	to
attempt	 to	 separate	 out	 the	 archaic	 persecutory
object	 representations	 from	 the	 archaic	 drives.
Indeed,	Freud’s	“drive	theory”	has	few	adherents
today.
It	 is	 certainly	 true	 as	 Todorov	 (pp.	 41-43)
quotes	Bakhtin	that	utterances	are	different	than
propositions	because	utterances	are	in	the	context
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
304
always	 of	 an	 interpersonal	 relationship.	 There	 is
nothing	really	new	in	this,	but	here	again	Bakhtin’s
naiveté	is	showing	because	he	says	in	this	quote
that,	 “Discourse	 is	 oriented	 toward	 the	 person
addressed,	oriented	toward	what	that	person	is.”
Discourse	is	certainly	oriented	toward	the	person
addressed,	 but	 perhaps	 it	 is	 better	 to	 say	 it	 is
oriented	toward	what	one	has	as	a	representation
of	 the	 person	 addressed,	 and	 this	 representation
comes	 from	 the	 life	 history	 and	 compromise
formations	of	the	individual	who	is	producing	the
utterance	or	discourse.	Understanding	this	would
give	 depth	 to	 Bakhtin’s	 increasingly	 popular	 but
ambiguous	 theories.	 The	 crucial	 premise	 of	 his
“dialogism”	 theory,	 that	 every	 utterance	 is	 also
related	
to	
previous	
utterances,	
creating
intertextual	 or	 dialogical	 relations,	 is	 very
important.	 But	 how	 is	 this	 much	 different	 than
Lacan’s	 concept	 of	 language	 he	 borrowed	 from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
305
Saussure?
Bakhtin’s	 later	 work	 seems	 to	 become
increasingly	vague	and	metaphysical	(see	Holquist
1990	 for	 details).	 It	 is	 certainly	 astute,	 and
perhaps	 Bakhtin	 gets	 the	 credit	 for	 having	 first
articulated	it,	to	say	that	the	intonation,	affective
tonality,	and	values	of	the	parents	give	rise	to	the
words	and	forms	that	constitute	the	first	images	in
the	mind	of	the	child.	But	it	is	another	thing	to	say
that,	“life	by	its	very	nature	is	dialogic”	(Bakhtin
1989,	p.	293).	Booth	points	out	in	his	introduction
(p.	 xxi)	 to	 Bakhtin’s	 (1989)	 book	 that	 there	 is
disagreement	about	the	extent	to	which	Bakhtin’s
unsystematic	system	is	religious	or	metaphysical.
His	 tendency	 to	 think	 away	 from	 the	 concept	 of
private	 or	 autonomous	 individuality	 to	 the
extreme	 of	 an	 essentially	 irreducible	 multi-
centeredness	 or	 “polyphony”	 of	 human	 life	 is
valuable,	 but	 it	 leaves	 the	 question	 of	 whether
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
306
there	is	anything	else	that	 constitutes	 the	 human
beside	 the	 cultural	 forces.	 The	 fact	 that	 humans
are	 not	 isolated	 countable	 units	 does	 not
necessarily	 imply	 that	 they	 are	 nothing	 but
products	of	the	collective,	a	concept	that	Marxist-
Leninists	held,	but	which	was	not	even	held	by	the
early	 Marx	 (1963),	 who	 believed	 that	 although
man	 was	 a	 species-being	 as	 Feuerbach	 claimed,
there	 were	 certain	 aspects	 that	 were	 universally
and	essentially	human	besides	what	is	formed	by
the	culture.
I	do	not	agree	with	the	extreme	postmodernist
or	 even	 deconstructionist	 positions,	 but	 hold	 a
more	moderate	view	in	between	the	Cartesian	and
the	 Bakhtin	 view	 of	 the	 subject.	 At	 least	 this	 is
what	 I	 gather	 about	 Bakhtin’s	 view	 after	 wading
through	what	the	translator	(Bakhtin	1989)	of	his
work	 calls	 “the	 repetitiousness,	 disorganization,
and	 reliance	 on	 neologisms”	 (p.	 xxvi).	 But	 it	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
307
valuable	 also	 to	 emphasize	 the	 translator’s
comment,	“Two	speakers	must	not,	and	never	do,
completely	 understand	 each	 other;	 they	 must
remain	 only	 partially	 satisfied	 with	 each	 other’s
replies,	because	the	continuation	of	dialogue	is	in
large	 part	 dependent	 on	 neither	 party	 knowing
exactly	 what	 the	 other	 means”	 (p.	 xxxii).	 This
certainly	 has	 application	 to	 our	 work.	 Schafer
(1992)	has	emphasized	Bakhtin’s	dialogism	in	his
approach	to	psychoanalytic	theory.
I	 will	 not	 discuss	 Bakhtin’s	 actual	 analysis	 of
Dostoevsky	 except	 to	 disagree	 with	 him	 on	 two
major	points.	First,	I	do	not	think	Dostoevsky	has
generated	a	whole	new	form	of	the	novel,	which
according	to	Bakhtin,	was	equaled	only	by	Dante.
Bakhtin’s	 description	 of	 Dostoevsky’s	 work	 as
polyphonic	 (allowing	 the	 characters	 to	 stand
independently	 against	 the	 author),	 and	 his
emphasis	 on	 the	 constant	 appearance	 of	 doubles
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
308
and	interior	dialogue	in	which	characters	examine
each	 other	 and	 in	 a	 sense	 have	 an	 equal
representation	with	that	of	the	author	is	accurate,
but	is	that	new	in	literature?	Can	we	not	find,	for
example,	 the	 same	 genius	 in	 Shakespeare?	 What
about	the	famous	soliloquies?	Some	scholars	even
present	
arguments	
that	
Homer’s	
Odyssey
represents	 a	 tale	 of	 self-exploration	 and	 self-
development.	The	difference,	of	course,	as	Bakhtin
says,	is	that	in	real	life	there	is	no	resolution	at	the
end	 and	 the	 truth	 about	 an	 individual	 remains
polyphonic	and	unintegrated.	Is	this	not	similar	to
Lacan?	How	would	one	apply	this	to	the	work	of
psychoanalysis?	Could	an	argument	be	made	that
the	 reason	 no	 resolution	 takes	 place	 in	 many	 of
Dostoevsky’s	
most	
important

because	they	remain	neurotic	to	the	very	end?	In
this	 sense	 Dostoevsky	 is	 being	 true	 to	 reality	 in
portraying	a	whole	variety	of	neurotics	as	he	does

309
in	 his	 incomparable	 fashion,	 but	 is	 it	 wise	 to
extrapolate	this	to	all	humans?
My	 second	 disagreement	 is	 with	 Bakhtin’s
(1989)	 insistence	 that	 “there	 is	 no	 causality	 in
Dostoevsky’s	 novels,	 no	 genesis,	 no	 explanations
based	 on	 the	 past,	 on	 the	 influences	 of	 the
environment	or	of	upbringing,	and	so	forth.	Every
act	a	character	commits	is	in	the	present,	and	in
this	sense	is	not	predetermined;	it	is	conceived	of
and	 represented	 by	 the	 author	 as	 free”	 (p.	 29).
This	 is	 wrong.	 In	 the	 new	 translations	 there	 are
innumerable	 passages	 in	 which	 Dostoevsky
discusses	
causality	
and	
the	
role	
of	
the
environment,	 as	 well	 as	 temperament	 or	 what
today	 would	 be	 called	 the	 organic	 or	 biological
genetic	 background	 of	 the	 individual.	 The	 whole
centerpiece	 of	 The	 Brothers	 Karamazov	 rests	 on
the	famous	Karamazov	extremes	of	passion	which

“Karamazov

portraying	the	internal	struggle	that	the	ego	must
constantly	endure	among	its	three	harsh	masters
as	 vividly	 described	 later	 in	 metapsychological
terms	 by	 Freud	 (1929).	 Each	 person	 solves	 this
struggle	 continuously	 and	 in	 their	 own	 unique

Rosen	(1953)	borrowed	this	term	from	Federn
(1952)	to	describe	his	remarkable	but	now	largely
forgotten	technique	of	intensive	psychotherapy	of
schizophrenic	 patients.	 He	 contended	 that	 many
times	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 such	 patients	 his
unconscious	 knew	 more	 than	 he	 did	 as	 the
therapist,	 so	 he	 simply	 let	 it	 lead	 him	 wherever
necessary.	His	crucial	technique	of	treatment	was
to	 view	 the	 therapist	 as	 a	 loving,	 omnipotent
protector	 and	 provider	 for	 the	 patient,	 since	 the
patient	 is	 under	 heavy	 psychic	 threat	 and,
according	to	Rosen,	has	for	the	most	part	become
an	 infant.	 Rosen	 believed	 that	 this	 catastrophic
collapse	 was	 due	 to	 unconsciously	 malevolent
mothering	 received	 by	 the	 patient;	 the	 antidote
was	 thus	 benevolent	 mothering.	 He	 postulated
that	the	unconscious	of	the	infant	is	cognizant	of
whether	 or	 not	 the	 mother	 has	 an	 unconscious
that	 makes	 it	 possible	 for	 her	 to	 be	 benevolent.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
313
This	 theory	 is	 very	 important	 and	 has	 many
ramifications	 for	 psychotherapy.	 For	 example,
Nacht	 (1988)	 stated,	 “What	 matters	 is	 what	 the
analyst	is	rather	than	what	he	says”	(p.	106).	(See
Nacht	[1962]	for	a	further	discussion).
In	 Rosen’s	 technique	 the	 therapist	 begins	 by
trying	 to	 convince	 the	 patient	 that	 he	 or	 she	 is
trying	to	help	and	understand,	and	actually	wishes
to	 give	 the	 patient	 what	 the	 patient	 cannot	 get
alone—benevolent	mothering.	The	therapist	must
have	 the	 deepest	 possible	 knowledge	 of	 the
unconscious	
and	
must	
be	
thoroughly
psychoanalyzed.	Rosen	himself	put	in	ten	hours	a
day	for	two	months	and	another	four	hours	a	day
for	seven	months	with	one	schizophrenic	patient.
He	 argued	 that	 the	 definition	 of	 recovery	 is	 not
simply	living	outside	an	institution	but	achieving
enough	 emotional	 maturity	 to	 withstand	 the
ordinary	 blows	 of	 life.	 Rosen	 used	 a	 variety	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
314
shocking	 behaviors	 with	 the	 patient,	 as	 well	 as
shocking	statements,	in	an	effort	to	“shake	things
up,”	 that	 is,	 to	 draw	 attention	 from	 the	 patient’s
interior	preoccupations.	In	cases	that	had	reached
a	 standstill	 he	 even	 tried	 to	 initiate	 important
therapeutic	 movement	 forward	 or	 backward	 by
finding	some	sort	of	wedge	into	the	psychosis	by
taking	control	of	the	patient	literally,	including	at
times	wrestling	the	patient	to	the	ground.
Rosen’s	 treatment	 procedures	 were	 observed
by	a	number	of	first-rate	psychiatrists	who	were
quite	 impressed	 by	 them.	 Later	 it	 became
apparent	
that	
the	
improvement	
Rosen
dramatically	obtained	did	not	prove	to	be	lasting;
however,	what	Rosen	did	demonstrate	is	that	even
the	
most	
regressed	
and	
deteriorated
schizophrenic	 patients	 may	 be	 reached	 and	 may
respond	to	intensive	psychotherapeutic	treatment
administered	 by	 a	 thoroughly	 psychoanalyzed

DREAMS
Although	 Freud	 considered	 dreams	 to	 be	 the
“royal	 road	 to	 the	 unconscious,”	 there	 is
considerable	 debate	 and	 discussion	 about	 the
meaning	 of	 dreams,	 and	 differing	 opinions	 over
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
316
the	 use	 of	 dream	 analysis	 in	 psychotherapy	 and
psychoanalysis	 even	 today.	 We	 know	 that
dreaming	is	a	normal	universal	phenomenon,	and
considerable	 research	 indicates	 that	 rapid	 eye
movements	 (REMs)	 in	 certain	 stages	 of	 sleep
accompany	 dreaming.	 This	 research	 tells	 us	 that
about	50	percent	of	the	night	sleep	of	an	infant	is
occupied	 by	 REM	 sleep	 and	 dreaming,	 but	 this
percentage	 diminishes	 in	 adulthood	 to	 about	 20
minutes	out	of	every	90	spent	sleeping.
The	great	classic	that	opened	the	door	to	the
introduction	of	dreams	into	psychiatric	treatment
was	 of	 course	 by	 Freud	 (1900),	 with	 some
emendations	in	later	papers	(Freud	1901,	1917).
Freud	divided	the	dream	into	the	manifest	content
as	 it	 was	 related	 by	 the	 patient	 and	 the	 latent
content,	 which	 consisted	 of	 the	 urge	 to	 fulfill	 a
wish	 and	 its	 mental	 representation.	 A	 dream
therefore	needed	to	be	interpreted	in	depth	from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
317
the	manifest	content	down	to	an	articulation	of	the
wish	that	was	fulfilled	in	the	dream	in	a	disguised
or	 distorted	 fashion.	 This	 disguise	 Freud	 labeled
the	 dream	 work,	 characterized	 by	 displacement,
condensation,	 substitution	 with	 the	 use	 of
symbols,	and	a	secondary	elaboration	in	which	the
dream	was	linked	together	in	some	sort	of	story	or
action.	
Displacement	
and	
condensation	
are
generally	 considered	 the	 most	 important	 aspects
of	the	dream	work.	Freud	labeled	the	precipitating
stimulus	to	the	dream	as	the	day	residue,	elements
from	 daily	 life	 that	 stirred	 up	 through	 derivative
connections	
certain	
unconscious	
wishes	
or
thoughts	 in	 the	 dreamer	 that	 press	 up	 for
expression.	 These	 erotic	 and	 aggressive	 infantile
drives	 are	 expressed	 in	 a	 disguised	 way	 and
discharged	through	that	expression,	thus	enabling
the	dreamer	to	continue	to	sleep.	As	Freud	pointed
out,	the	function	of	the	dream	is	to	permit	sleep	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
318
continue.
Freud’s	
(1900)	
original	
work	
on	
the
interpretation	
of	
dreams	
was	
preoccupied
primarily	with	demonstrations	and	illustrations	of
how	 the	 manifest	 content	 of	 the	 dream	 through
free	 association	 can	 be	 decoded	 to	 reveal	 the
latent	 content,	 the	 unconscious	 infantile	 dream
wishes	
that	
are	
expressed	
(see	
FREE
ASSOCIATION).	 The	 dreams	 that	 Freud	 used	 as
examples	 are	 mostly	 his	 own,	 which	 carried	 the
problem	 that	 Freud	 did	 not	 always	 properly
interpret	his	own	dreams,	and	in	some	instances
refused	to	carry	the	interpretation	past	a	certain
limit	 because	 of	 personal	 reticence.	 There	 has
been	a	vast	literature	(Grinstein	1980)	on	Freud’s
dreams	 as	 they	 are	 revealed	 in	 his	 master	 work.
Psychoanalysts	 eagerly	 picked	 up	 Freud’s	 dream
interpretation	technique	and	in	the	early	days	of
the	discipline	spent	a	great	deal	of	time	analyzing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
319
their	 patients’	 dreams	 and	 the	 dreams	 of	 each
other.	 This	 mutual	 dream	 analyzing	 among
pioneer	
psychoanalysts	
led	
to	
considerable
hostility	at	times.
Sharpe	 (1951)	 wrote	 a	 classic	 monograph	 in
1937	 illustrating	 the	 standard	 use	 of	 dreams	 in
psychoanalytic	practice	in	the	first	quarter	of	the
twentieth	 century.	 It	 is	 a	 thorough	 review,
although	 it	 contributes	 little	 that	 is	 new.	 French
and	 Fromm	 (1964)	 presented	 quite	 a	 radical
approach	 to	 dream	 interpretation,	 in	 which	 they
concentrated	 on	 the	 reactive	 motive	 to	 the
infantile	 wish.	 They	 believed	 that	 the	 thought
processes	 behind	 dreams	 are	 rational	 and	 were
more	 interested	 in	 why	 the	 infantile	 wish	 was
disturbing	to	the	dreamer	than	in	the	wish	itself.
Their	 work	 represented	 a	 transition,	 focusing
more	 on	 ego	 functions	 as	 they	 are	 revealed	 in
dream	analysis	than	on	the	nature	of	the	id	wishes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
320
themselves.	 These	 authors	 recognized	 that	 every
dream	has	many	meanings,	but,	they	pointed	out,
each	 dream	 rests	 on	 a	 focal	 conflict	 along	 with
other	“subfocal”	conflicts.	The	focal	conflict	is	the
most	 cathected	 meaning.	 These	 conflicts	 are
interpersonal	 and	 involve	 adaptation,	 but	 the
current	 conflicts	 over	 interpersonal	 adaptations
are	 derivatives	 of	 the	 past.	 Using	 a	 theory	 of
thought	processes	that	has	not	been	accepted,	the
authors	 concluded	 with	 a	 focus	 on	 the	 patient’s
ego.
Altman	(1969)	gives	an	excellent	review	of	the
use	
of	
dream	
interpretation	
in	
classical
psychoanalysis	
with	
many	
examples	
and
comments	 about	 technique.	 His	 book,	 he	 says,	 is
for	 trained	 analysts,	 but	 it	 illustrates	 the
extraordinary	 selectivity	 that	 is	 used	 in	 the
interpretation	of	dreams,	even	in	psychoanalysis.
Rothstein	(1987)	presents	a	current	collection	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
321
arguments	about	dream	interpretation.	One	of	the
issues	that	is	unresolved	deals	with	the	so-called
self-state	dream	of	Kohut	in	self	psychology.	All	of
the	 authors	 in	 Rothstein’s	 work	 disagree	 with
Kohut	 on	 self-state	 dreams,	 which	 I	 will	 now
discuss.
Kohut’s	 (1977)	 self	 psychology	 emphasizes
“disintegration	anxiety,”	which	typically	occurs	as
a	result	of	the	failure	of	a	selfobject	to	live	up	to
demands,	 severe	 narcissistic	 wounding,	 or	 the
danger	 of	 uncontrolled	 regression	 in	 intensive
psychotherapy	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY).	 It	 is
clinically	
different	
in	
both	
dreams	
and
experienced	phenomena	from	the	classical	signal
anxiety	 in	 Freud’s	 structural	 theory,	 which	 is
based	on	castration	fear	or	fear	of	separation.	It	is
not	related	to	the	fear	of	the	loss	of	love,	but	rather
to	 the	 fear	 of	 disintegration	 of	 the	 sense	 of	 self
(see	FRAGMENTATION),	which	would	essentially
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
322
result	in	a	psychosis	in	consequence	of	the	loss	of
an	
intense	
archaic	
enmeshment	
with	
the
selfobject.	It	is	vague,	cannot	be	pinned	down	by
clinical	questioning,	cannot	be	expressed	in	detail,
and	is	not	attached	to	any	one	situation.
In	 self-state	 dreams	 (Kohut	 1977),	 which
announce	such	anxiety,	associations	lead	nowhere.
The	 analyst	 should	 not	 challenge	 the	 patient’s
explanations	of	this	anxiety	(a	different	approach
from	that	taken	with	classical	castration	anxiety)
as	 these	 provide	 a	 tension-reducing	 intellectual
structure.	 Instead	 of	 faultfinding	 or	 arguing	 with
the	patient’s	explanations,	it	is	best	to	concentrate
on	finding	the	narcissistic	wound	that	touched	off
the	 anxiety	 and	 then	 explaining	 the	 sequence	 to
the	patient.
The	 self-state	 dream	 has	 been	 the	 target	 of
strong	 disapproval	 by	 some	 critics	 of	 self
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
323
psychology.	Kohut	(Lichtenberg	and	Kaplan	1983)
attempts	 to	 directly	 address	 this	 problem,	 which
arose	out	of	a	misunderstanding	of	a	short	passage
from	The	Restoration	of	the	Self	(Kohut	1977,	pp.
109-110).	 It	 is	 not	 true	 that	 such	 dreams	 are
interpreted	 only	 from	 the	 manifest	 contents.
Associations	are	not	ignored.	Kohut	points	out	that
the	clue	to	the	self-state	dream	is	that	associations
lead	 nowhere:	 “At	 best	 they	 provide	 us	 with
further	imagery	that	remains	on	the	same	level	as
the	 manifest	 content	 of	 the	 dream”	 (Lichtenberg
and	 Kaplan	 1983,	 p.	 402).	 It	 is	 most	 critical	 that
the	 analyst’s	 understanding	 of	 the	 state	 of	 the
patient’s	 self,	 as	 depicted	 in	 the	 imagery	 of	 self-
state	dreams,	be	accurate	because	“only	when	an
analysand	feels	that	the	state	of	his	self	has	been
accurately	 understood	 by	 the	 selfobject	 analyst
will	 he	 feel	 sufficiently	 secure	 to	 go	 further”	 (p.
406).	Pressing	the	patient	for	further	associations
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
324
in	order	to	emerge	with	dynamic-genetic	conflict-
based	 interpretations	 will	 be	 experienced	 by	 the
patient	 as	 an	 empathic	 failure	 and	 will	 generate
rage	 and	 “resistances.”	 Kohut	 does	 admit	 that
most	dreams	are	not	self-state	(p.	404)	and	must
be	pursued	in	the	traditional	way.
It	 should	 be	 noted	 that	 some	 biological
psychiatrists	 currently	 dispute	 Freud’s	 entire
theory	of	the	function	of	dreams	and	substitute	for
it	 various	 versions	 of	 a	 neurophysiological
discharge	theory.	This	view	began	with	Aristotle.
In	my	clinical	experience	the	best	approach	to
dreams	 in	 psychotherapy	 is	 a	 function	 of	 the
amount	of	time	that	is	available	in	the	treatment
and	the	length	of	the	dream.	In	a	psychoanalysis,	a
short	 dream	 lends	 itself	 to	 the	 flow	 of	 free
associations	 and	 a	 rather	 thorough	 analysis	 of
wherever	 they	 lead;	 in	 an	 intermittent,	 once-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
325
weekly	 psychotherapy,	 a	 long	 dream	 may	 not	 be
able	 to	 be	 studied,	 except	 in	 a	 most	 superficial
manner.	 The	 psychotherapist	 should	 always	 be
aware	that	the	presentation	of	a	long	dream	that
takes	 up	 much	 of	 a	 session	 can	 be	 a	 defensive
maneuver	by	the	patient’s	unconscious	to	preempt
the	 time	 and	 make	 discussion	 of	 serious	 current
issues	impossible.
In	general,	it	is	wise	to	follow	the	lead	of	the
patient’s	associations	after	telling	a	dream	and	to
fit	 the	 dream	 material	 with	 whatever	 is	 the
current	transference	situation	in	the	treatment.	It
is	 especially	 prudent	 to	 avoid	 interpretations
based	on	the	use	of	symbols,	which	often	sounds
to	the	patient	like	a	form	of	quackery	or	popular
psychology.	 Most	 interpretations	 offered	 by
patients	 of	 their	 own	 dreams	 should	 be	 viewed
with	 suspicion,	 but	 it	 is	 important	 to	 take	 them
seriously	 and	 not	 humiliate	 the	 patients	 by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
326
ignoring	them.	Certainly	some	dreams	do	seem	to
be	 representative	 of	 the	 patient’s	 state	 of
impending	 disintegration,	 and	 as	 such	 are	 a
warning	and	a	cry	for	help.
The	art	of	dream	interpretation	and	its	proper
use	in	intensive	psychotherapy	or	psychoanalysis
is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 important	 crafts	 that	 the
psychotherapist	 has	 to	 learn;	 it	 requires	 a
thorough	capacity	on	the	part	of	the	therapist	to
analyze	his	or	her	own	dreams	as	a	consequence
of	a	successful	psychoanalysis.	An	excellent	review
of	 the	 classical	 psychoanalytic	 theory	 of	 dreams
may	be	found	in	Nagera	(1969).

DRIVE
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
328
(see	also	DEATH	INSTINCT)
This	 term	 was	 sometimes	 used	 in	 place	 of
“instinct”	
in	
psychoanalytic	
theory	
because
“instinct”	in	biology	implies	a	genetic	sequence	of
behavior	 that	 is	 triggered	 by	 certain	 stimuli.	 It
stands	 on	 the	 border	 of	 the	 somatic	 and	 the
psychic;	 the	 biological	 needs	 of	 the	 organism
generate	certain	tensions	for	discharge,	which	are
reflected	 on	 the	 psychological	 level	 by	 mental
representations	in	the	unconscious.	Freud’s	term
Trieb	was	translated	by	Strachey	in	the	Standard
Edition	 of	 Freud’s	 work,	 however,	 as	 “instinct,”
and	 no	 useful	 purpose	 is	 served	 to	 try	 to
distinguish	
between	
instinct	
and	
drive	
in
psychoanalytic	theory	as	Freud	presented	it.	The
preface	 to	 the	 Standard	 Edition	 gives	 Strachey’s
(1966)	reasons	for	the	use	of	the	term	“instinct”;
“There	seems	little	doubt	that,	from	the	standpoint
of	modern	biology,	Freud	used	the	word	‘Trieb’	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
329
cover	a	variety	of	different	concepts”	(p.	xxv).	For
that	 reason,	 Strachey	 sees	 no	 advantage	 in
translating	Trieb	into	a	word	that	is	not	an	English
word,	since	“drive,”	he	says,	could	not	be	found	in
the	Oxford	English	Dictionary.
Controversy	 continues	 about	 whether	 the
concept	of	drives	or	instincts	has	to	be	retained	at
all;	a	number	of	alternative	metapsychologies	have
been	 developed	 without	 it,	 whereas	 traditional
psychoanalysts	
still	
use	
it	
in	
their
metapsychological	 thinking.	 I	 contend	 that	 one’s
keeping	or	replacing	drive	theory	has	a	lot	to	do
with	 one’s	 basic	 beliefs	 about	 the	 nature	 of
humans.	For	example,	modern	research	raises	the
question	of	whether	infants	are	primarily	a	bundle
of	 drives	 or	 are	 born	 with	 the	 capacity	 and	 the
need	
for	
object	
relationships.	
Many
psychoanalysts	 today	 have	 embraced	 object
relations	theories	of	one	form	or	another	in	place
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
330
of	
drive	
theory	
(see	
OBJECT	
RELATIONS
THEORY),	citing	both	their	clinical	experience	and
results	 from	 infant	 research.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,
the	historically	proven	primacy	of	human	lust	and
aggression	 makes	 Freud’s	 theory	 seem	 quite
plausible.	The	matter	remains	unresolved.

EATING	DISORDERS
(see	BULIMIA)
EGO,
EGO-IDEAL,
SUPEREGO
(see	also	ID	and	SUPEREGO)
Many	 aspects	 of	 Freud’s	 (1923)	 The	 Ego	 and
the	 Id	 are	 important	 in	 the	 practice	 of	 intensive
psychotherapy.	 This	 work	 is	 Freud’s	 basic
presentation	of	the	structural	theory	of	the	mind,	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
332
radical	revision	of	his	earlier	“topographic”	theory.
Of	 special	 interest	 is	 Freud’s	 description	 of	 the
relation	of	the	ego	to	the	id	as	analogous	to	a	rider
on	horseback.	The	rider	has	to	hold	in	check	the
superior	 strength	 of	 the	 horse	 “with	 this
difference,	 that	 the	 rider	 tries	 to	 do	 so	 with	 his
own	strength	while	the	ego	uses	borrowed	forces,”
and	often	a	rider,	“if	he	is	not	to	be	parted	from	his
horse,	is	forced	to	guide	it	where	it	wants	to	go”	(p.
25)—so	 sometimes	 the	 ego	 must	 transform	 the
id’s	 will	 into	 action	 as	 if	 it	 were	 the	 ego’s	 own
wish.
The	 traditional	 goal	 of	 psychotherapy	 is	 to
uncover	 the	 unconscious	 and	 help	 the	 ego	 to
sublimate	 and	 control	 the	 power	 of	 the	 id	 while
dealing	with	the	superego	and	reality.	There	is	a
limit	to	how	much	one	can	accomplish	that	in	turn
depends	 on	 how	 much	 one	 can	 help	 the	 ego	 to
sublimate,	 utilize,	 and	 control	 id	 energy.	 This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
333
activity	of	the	ego	has	a	drive-channeling	function.
The	 ego	 also	 has	 a	 drive-curbing	 function—	 this
represents	 the	 ego,	 or	 rider	 off	 the	 horse.	 In	 an
atmosphere	of	appropriate	soothing,	structures	in
the	 preoedipal	 ego	 acquire	 form.	 For	 self
psychologists,	
this	
is	
a	
consequence	
of
transmuting	microinternalizations	and	the	gradual
integration	of	the	archaic,	grandiose	self	(see	SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).
In	 the	 early	 phases	 of	 development,	 Freud
(1923)	 explains,	 “the	 character	 of	 the	 ego	 is	 a
precipitate	 of	 abandoned	 object-cathexes	 and	 …
contains	 the	 history	 of	 those	 object-choices”	 (p.
29).	The	condition	of	identification	is	a	major	one
under	 which	 the	 id	 can	 give	 up	 its	 object,
according	to	Freud,	and	in	the	early	years	of	life
the	
separation	
from	
objects	
requires	
a
precipitation	 of	 identifications	 with	 the	 lost
objects	 in	 the	 ego.	 In	 an	 extremely	 important
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
334
clinical	passage	Freud	reminds	us	that	if	there	are
too	 many	 object	 identifications	 in	 the	 ego,	 “too
numerous,	 unduly	 powerful	 and	 incompatible
with	one	another”	(p.	30),	a	pathological	outcome
will	 not	 be	 far	 off.	 As	 a	 consequence	 of	 the
different	identifications	becoming	cut	off	from	one
another	 by	 resistances,	 a	 disruption	 of	 the	 ego
may	occur;	at	least,	conflicts	between	the	various
identifications	 can	 take	 place.	 Furthermore,	 as
Freud	 points	 out,	 the	 effects	 of	 the	 first
identifications	made	in	earliest	childhood	will	be
most	 general	 and	 lasting.	 It	 follows	 that	 any
psychotherapy	 aiming	 to	 produce	 major	 changes
in	 the	 ego	 must	 struggle	 with	 these	 earliest
identifications.
In	Freud’s	theory	the	ego	is	that	part	of	the	id
that	has	been	modified	by	the	direct	influence	of
the	external	world—it	is	first	and	foremost	a	body
ego,	 an	 extension	 of	 the	 surface	 differentiation
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
335
between	the	body	and	the	rest	of	the	world.	It	is
ultimately	
derived	
from	
body	
sensations,
especially	those	springing	from	the	surface	of	the
body;	 Freud	 liked	 to	 regard	 it	 as	 a	 mental
projection	of	the	surface	of	the	body,	akin	to	the
famous	
cortical	
homunculus	
of	
the
neuroanatomists	 in	 describing	 the	 projection	 of
the	pyramidal	tract	fibers	on	the	cerebral	cortex.
The	 ego	 comes	 into	 being	 by	 the	 rhythmical
and	phase-appropriate	appearance	of	the	mother
administering	to	the	infant’s	needs.	This	produces
the	beginning	perception	that	a	source	outside	the
infant	 has	 the	 capacity	 to	 protect	 it	 from
overstimulation	and	unpleasure;	consequently,	the
initial	anxiety	of	being	overwhelmed	from	within
by	 painful	 stimuli	 becomes	 replaced	 by	 anxiety
regarding	the	appearance	or	disappearance	of	the
mother	 (see	 STIMULUS	 BARRIER).	 A	 phase-
appropriate	 appearance	 and	 disappearance	 can
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
336
enable	the	ego	to	set	up	an	identification	with	the
mother;	drive-channeling	mechanisms	develop	so
that	gradually	a	delay	in	the	mother’s	appearance
can	 be	 tolerated	 and	 eventually	 the	 process	 of
separation-individuation	 can	 occur.	 However,
until	 the	 time	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex,	 the	 ego
remains	quite	primitive	and	limited	in	the	variety
of	 mechanisms	 at	 its	 disposal	 (see	 OEDIPUS
COMPLEX).
The	
most	
important	
psychotherapeutic
consequence	of	the	structural	theory	that	emerged
out	of	the	genius	of	Freud’s	old	age	was	to	place
the	 ego	 in	 the	 limelight	 of	 psychotherapy,
especially	as	the	site	of	anxiety.	In	the	structural
theory,	 the	 main	 concern	 of	 psychotherapy	 is	 to
relieve	the	ego’s	suffering	under	the	pressures	of
three	harsh	masters—the	id,	the	superego,	and	the
external	reality—by	reducing	these	pressures	and
helping	 the	 ego	 to	 acquire	 strength.	 Ellenberger
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
337
(1970)	explains:
As	a	consequence	of	these	new	theories,	the
focus	 of	 Freudian	 therapy	 shifted	 from	 the
analysis	 of	 the	 instinctual	 forces	 to	 that	 of
the	
ego,	
from	
the	
repressed	
to	
the
repressing.	 Analysis	 of	 defenses	 would
necessarily	uncover	anxiety,	and	the	task	of
the	analyst	was	now	to	dispel	the	excess	of
anxiety	and	to	strengthen	the	ego,	so	that	it
could	face	reality	and	control	the	pressure	of
drives	and	the	superego,	[p.	517]
The	 fact	 that	 the	 mechanisms	 of	 defense
operating	 within	 the	 ego	 and	 the	 need	 for
punishment	
are	
often	
not	
accessible	
to
consciousness	 forced	 the	 revision	 in	 Freud’s
thinking	 from	 the	 topographic	 to	 the	 structural
theory	 of	 the	 mind.	 The	 cruel,	 relentless,	 even
destructive	 attitude	 of	 the	 superego	 toward	 the
individual	is,	in	many	cases,	very	striking	and	may
be	entirely	unconscious	in	the	patient.	Aggressive
energy	 is	 borrowed	 from	 the	 id	 by	 the	 superego
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
338
and	 channeled	 into	 the	 superego’s	 cruelty	 and
destructiveness,	all	of	which	may	go	on	outside	the
consciousness.	In	certain	cases,	the	superego	may
gain	 the	 position	 of	 a	 tyrannical	 power	 over	 the
rest	of	the	personality	and	proceed	in	the	slow	or
even	 dramatic	 process	 of	 subjugating	 and
destroying	the	individual.
According	to	Freud’s	theory,	the	precursors	of
the	superego	are	not	very	relevant;	the	superego	is
seen	predominantly	as	the	heir	of	the	resolution	of
the	Oedipus	complex,	and	the	firm	consolidation	of
the	mind	into	ego,	id,	and	superego	occurs	at	the
point	 of	 the	 resolution	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex,
followed	 by	 latency	 identifications	 and	 the
consolidation	process	of	puberty.	The	exact	details
of	this	consolidation	remain	somewhat	in	dispute,
but	the	important	clinical	point	is	that	before	the
age	of	4	to	6,	when	the	Oedipus	complex	becomes
central,	one	cannot	speak	of	a	significant	superego
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
339
or	 of	 an	 internalized	 behavior-regulating	 system
unless,	like	the	Kleinians,	one	introduces	a	major
modification	of	Freud’s	thought.
To	 review	 briefly	 Freud’s	 conceptions	 of	 the
superego	 and	 ego-ideal,	 we	 might	 begin	 with	 his
(1914)	paper	“On	Narcissism,”	written	before	the
structural	 theory	 was	 presented.	 Here	 Freud
proposed	 two	 psychic	 agencies	 that	 function	 to
preserve	 for	 the	 ego	 a	 sense	 of	 self-esteem.	 The
first	 agent,	 or	 ego-ideal,	 represents	 the	 series	 of
achievements	that,	if	they	can	be	reached,	lead	to	a
state	
of	
imagined	
infantile	
perfection	
and
narcissistic	 bliss.	 Freud	 differentiated	 this	 agent
from	
the	
agent	
that	
observed	
the	
real
achievements	and	compared	them	with	the	ideal
standards.	
In	
Introductory	
Lectures	
on
Psychoanalysis,	Freud	(1916)	considered	this	self-
criticizing	 faculty	 to	 be	 the	 same	 as	 the	 dream
censor	 and	 as	 belonging	 to	 the	 ego,	 not	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
340
superego.
In	Group	Psychology	and	the	Analysis	of	the	Ego
(1921),	the	separateness,	of	the	“conscience”	and
ego-ideal	from	the	ego	begins	to	appear	in	Freud’s
thinking;	here	he	conceives	of	the	possibility	of	the
ego-ideal-conscience	as	coming	into	conflict	with
the	 rest	 of	 the	 ego,	 even	 raging	 with	 a	 critical
cruelty	against	the	ego.	The	extent	of	this	cruelty,
which	 can	 function	 unconsciously,	 was	 a	 major
motivation	 for	 the	 development	 of	 the	 structural
theory.
Freud	 always	 considered	 the	 development	 of
the	superego	primarily	to	be	a	consequence	of	the
resolution	of	the	Oedipus	complex.	He	increasingly
emphasized	the	punitive	and	cruel	aspects	of	the
superego	rather	than	its	benign,	loving	aspect.	In
Inhibitions,	 Symptoms	 and	 Anxiety,	 he	 (1926)
portrayed	 the	 threat	 from	 the	 superego	 as	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
341
extension	of	the	castration	threat.	Finally,	in	New
Introductory	Lectures	on	Psychoanalysis,	he	(1933)
viewed	 the	 superego	 as	 an	 internalized	 parental
authority	dominating	the	ego	through	punishment
and	 threats	 of	 withdrawal	 of	 love.	 The	 apparent
paradox	 of	 the	 clinically	 observed	 contrast
between	the	harshness	of	the	superego	imitation
of	the	parents	and	the	gentleness	of	the	parents	in
real	life	was	explained	through	the	borrowing	by
the	 superego	 of	 the	 child’s	 own	 hostility	 to	 the
prohibiting	 parent.	 Thus	 the	 superego	 is	 always
thought	of	as	having	a	direct	connection	to	the	id
and	 as	 able	 to	 drain	 aggression	 from	 the	 id	 by
turning	it	upon	the	ego.
The	classic	work	on	the	mechanisms	of	defense
employed	by	the	ego	is	by	Anna	Freud	(1946)	(see
FREUD,	 ANNA).	 The	 signal	 of	 anxiety	 sets	 these
mechanisms	of	defense	in	action	(Freud	1926).	As
Anna	 Freud	 elaborates,	 this	 is	 sometimes	 felt	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
342
superego	anxiety,	“objective”	anxiety	(such	as	that
of	 infantile	 fantasies	 and	 bodily	 fears,	 e.g.,	 of
castration),	dread	of	the	strength	of	the	instincts,
or	disruption	of	the	ego’s	need	for	synthesis	and
harmony	 in	 adult	 life.	 According	 to	 Anna	 Freud,
the	purpose	of	analysis	is	to	make	the	mechanisms
of	defense	conscious	so	that	the	original	impulses
may	come	through	and	the	patient	can	deal	with
them	in	a	more	adult	way.	A	preliminary	stage	of
defense	would	involve	denial	in	fantasy,	word,	or
act,	or	simply	restriction	and	withdrawal	from	the
field	 of	 activities	 and	 experiences.	 Anna	 Freud
mentions	 the	 more	 sophisticated	 defenses	 of
identification	 with	 the	 aggressor	 and	 a	 form	 of
altruism	 or	 “altruistic	 surrender”	 of	 one’s	 own
instinctual	impulses	in	favor	of	other	people,	such
as	 that	 illustrated	 in	 Rostand’s	 famous	 play,
Cyrano	 de	 Bergerac.	 There	 are	 also	 defenses
motivated	 by	 the	 fear	 of	 the	 strength	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
343
instincts	as	manifested	in	the	typical	phenomena
of	
puberty.	
These	
characteristic	
adolescent
defense	mechanisms	are	asceticism,	intellectuality,
and	 new	 object	 “loves”	 taking	 place	 through
identification.
The	 ego	 defense	 mechanism	 of	 introjection
represents	a	totalistic	phenomenon	in	which	one
takes	 in	 the	 ambivalently	 loved	 object	 (see
INTROJECTION).	 It	 then	 functions	 inside	 as	 an
introject.	 This	 is	 a	 more	 basic	 process	 than
identification,	in	which	only	a	certain	aspect	of	the
personality	 of	 the	 object	 is	 taken	 in	 (see
IDENTIFICATION).	 Healthy	 adolescents	 identify
but	 rarely	 introject.	 The	 ego	 is	 victorious,	 says
Anna	Freud,	when	its	defense	mechanisms	effect
their	purpose,	to	avoid	anxiety	and	transform	the
instincts	 so	 even	 in	 difficult	 circumstances	 some
gratification	is	secured.	It	is	the	task	of	the	ego	to
establish	 a	 harmonious	 relation	 between	 the	 id,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
344
the	superego,	and	the	outer	world.	This	allows	us
to	 speak	 roughly	 of	 “ego	 strength”	 depending	 on
how	well	the	task	has	been	accomplished.
Freud	 never	 differentiated	 clearly	 between
“ego”	 and	 “self.”	 It	 was	 Hartmann	 (1950)	 who
distinguished	 the	 libidinal	 cathexis	 to	 the	 ego,
which	 represents	 a	 narcissistic	 ego	 cathexis;	 the
libidinal	
cathexis	
to	
the	
self	
(or	
self
representation),	which	represents	narcissism;	and
the	libidinal	cathexis	to	the	soma,	or	body,	which
is	clinically	manifest	as	hypochondriasis.	The	focus
in	 psychoanalytic	 theory	 shifted	 from	 the	 id
(1897-1923),	
in	
which	
authoritative	
id
interpretations	 were	 made	 to	 the	 patient,	 to	 the
ego	(1923	and	thereafter),	in	which	the	emphasis
was	 on	 the	 interpretation	 of	 the	 ego	 as	 it	 often
unconsciously	
functioned	
in	
defenses	
and
resistances.	A	vast	and	detailed	“ego	psychology”
literature	 arose	 on	 these	 topics,	 especially	 in	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
345
United	States.
In	Hartmann’s	(1950,	1958)	work,	the	ego	was
thought	 to	 also	 contain	 primary	 and	 secondary
autonomous	functions,	as	well	as	intrapsychic	self
and	 object	 representations	 and	 identifications.	 A
secondary	 autonomous	 function	 is	 one	 that	 has
become	separated	from	its	instinctual	origins	and
over	which	the	ego	now	has	a	certain	dominance
and	can	use	it	in	the	service	of	adaptation.	The	ego
is	the	executive	organ	of	the	reality	principle	and
is	ruled	by	secondary	process	thought.	In	Freud’s
thinking,	 it	 developed	 from	 the	 id,	 but	 in
Hartmann’s	 conceptions	 the	 ego	 developed	 from
separate	ego	anlage.
Hartmann	(1958)	introduced	the	notion	of	the
conflict-free	 ego	 sphere.	 This	 is	 based	 on	 inborn
ego	 apparatuses	 and	 represents	 ego	 processes
outside	the	realm	of	conflicts.	A	change	of	function
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
346
of	 the	 mechanisms	 of	 defense	 enables	 them	 to
shift	into	the	conflict-free	sphere	in	the	service	of
adaptation.	 Thus	 for	 Hartmann	 we	 have	 primary
autonomous	 ego	 functions,	 which	 have	 been	 so
from	 the	 beginning	 and	 develop	 from	 inborn
apparatuses,	 and	 ego	 functions	 that	 have	 gained
secondary	 autonomy	 after	 being	 used	 in	 the
service	 of	 dealing	 with	 intrapsychic	 conflict.
Hartmann	believes	there	to	be	a	rank	order	of	ego
functions	that	decisively	affect	a	person’s	stability
and	effectiveness.
The	most	accurate	current	thinking	about	the
ego	 conceives	 of	 it	 as	 the	 sum	 of	 certain	 mental
functions,	including	perception,	memory,	and	the
mechanisms	of	defense.	The	critical	task	of	the	ego
is	to	mediate	between	the	three	harsh	masters	and
form	compromises	in	order	to	resolve	intrapsychic
conflict	
as	
efficiently	
as	
possible.	
These
compromises,	beginning	early	in	life,	determine	all
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
347
of	
an	
individual’s	
significant	
choices	
and
personality	 traits.	 Whatever	 emotions,	 thoughts,
or	 behaviors	 that	 are	 experienced	 by	 the	 ego	 as
unacceptable	and	foreign	to	the	self	are	known	as
“ego-dystonic”	 or	 “ego-alien.”	 An	 example	 of	 this
would	be	various	neurotic	symptoms	that	trouble
individuals	 and	 bring	 them	 into	 treatment.
Thoughts,	behaviors,	or	affects	that	are	acceptable
are	 known	 as	 “ego-syntonic.”	 An	 example	 of	 this
would	
be	
an	
individual’s	
personality
characteristics	 that	 he	 or	 she	 accepts	 or	 is	 even
unaware	of.	In	work	with	character	disorders	we
often	
have	
to	
make	
certain	
personality
characteristics	 that	 were	 ego-syntonic,	 ego-
dystonic.	
This	
often	
involves	
undoing	
the
disavowal	
of	
the	
consequences	
of	
certain
previously	ego-syntonic	behavior	patterns.	These
behavior	patterns,	like	all	choices	and	symptoms,
are	compromises	formed	by	the	ego	early	in	life.

EGO	CONSCIOUSNESS,
EGO	EXPERIENCE,
EGO	FEELING
Federn	 (1952)	 pointed	 out	 that	 the	 ego	 was
more	 than	 simply	 the	 sum	 total	 of	 the	 usual	 ego
functions	that	psychoanalysts	talk	about:	“The	ego,
however,	 is	 more	 inclusive;	 more	 especially	 it
includes	the	subjective	psychic	experience	of	these
functions	with	a	characteristic	sensation”	(p.	61).
He	 labeled	 this	 subjective	 experience	 the	 ego
experience	 (Icherlebnis),	 the	 ego’s	 experience	 of
itself.
This	phenomenon	cannot	be	clearly	explained.
As	 long	 as	 the	 ego	 functions	 normally,	 one	 may
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
350
ignore	 or	 be	 unaware	 of	 its	 functioning.	 To	 use
Federn’s	 metaphor,	 normally	 there	 is	 no	 more
awareness	 of	 the	 ego	 than	 the	 air	 one	 breathes;
only	when	respiration	becomes	burdensome	is	the
lack	 of	 air	 recognized.	 The	 subjective	 ego
experience	 includes	 “the	 feeling	 of	 unity,	 in
continuity,	 contiguity,	 and	 causality,	 in	 the
experiences	of	the	individual”	(Federn	1952,	p.	6).
In	 waking	 life	 the	 sensation	 of	 one’s	 own	 ego	 is
omnipresent,	but	it	undergoes	continuous	changes
in	quality	and	intensity.
Federn	 attempted	 to	 distinguish	 within	 the
subjective	 ego	 experience	 between	 ego	 feeling
(Ichgefühl)	
and	
ego	
consciousness
(Ichbewusstsein).	Ego	consciousness	represents	an
enduring	 consciousness	 and	 knowledge	 that	 our
ego	
is	
continuous	
and	
persistent,	
despite
interruptions	
by	
sleep	
or	
unconsciousness,
because	 we	 “know”	 intuitively	 that	 processes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
351
within	us,	even	though	they	may	be	interrupted	by
forgetting	 or	 unconsciousness,	 have	 a	 persistent
origin	 within	 us,	 and	 that	 our	 body	 and	 psyche
belong	permanently	to	our	ego.	Ego	consciousness
involves	 our	 conviction	 of	 the	 continuity	 of	 our
person	in	respect	to	time,	space,	and	causality.	Our
sense	of	ego	consciousness	plays	a	central	role	in
the	 argument	 of	 Kant’s	 Critique	 of	 Pure	 Reason.
Ego	consciousness	in	the	pure	state	remains	only
when	there	is	a	deficiency	in	ego	feeling.	Thus	the
mere	 empty	 knowledge	 of	 oneself	 is	 already	 a
pathological	 state	 known	 as	 estrangement	 or
depersonalization.
In	contrast,	ego	feeling
is	 the	 totality	 of	 feeling	 which	 one	 has	 of
one’s	 own	 living	 person.	 It	 is	 the	 residual
experience	
which	
persists	
after	
the
subtraction	 of	 all	 ideational	 contents—a
state	 which,	 in	 practice,	 occurs	 only	 for	 a
very	 brief	 time.	 …	 Ego	 feeling,	 therefore,	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
352
the	
simplest	
and	
yet	
the	
most
comprehensive	 psychic	 state	 which	 is
produced	in	the	personality	by	the	fact	of	its
own	 existence,	 even	 in	 the	 absence	 of
external	 or	 internal	 stimuli.	 [Federn	 1952,
pp.	62-63]
Ego	feeling	is	the	constantly	present	sensation	of
one’s	 own	 person,	 the	 ego’s	 own	 perception	 of
itself.
Federn	 maintained	 that	 ego	 feeling	 is	 quite
different	from	mere	knowledge	of	one’s	self	or	of
consciousness	of	the	ego	at	work;	it	is	primarily	a
feeling	 or	 sensation,	 normally	 taken	 for	 granted.
Remarkably,	Federn	pointed	out,	and	he	certainly
had	 not	 read	 Heidegger’s	 (1962)	 comment	 that
German	 and	 Greek	 were	 the	 only	 languages	 for
philosophy,	 that	 the	 classical	 Greek	 language,	 in
contrast	to	English,	is	necessary	to	get	an	intuitive
verbal	 concept	 of	 ego	 feeling.	 This	 is	 because	 in
the	 classical	 Greek	 language	 there	 is	 a	 middle
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
353
voice,	a	neutral	objectless	form.	The	middle	voice
implies	action	involving	one’s	self	and	not	passing
over	to	other	objects.	In	English	the	middle	voice
is	 expressed	 by	 certain	 intransitive	 phrases	 such
as	 I	 grow,	 I	 drive,	 I	 live,	 I	 prosper,	 I	 develop,	 I
perish,	I	age,	I	die.
Our	
intuitive	
conviction	
or	
grasp	
or
foreknowledge	of	the	Being	of	humans	comes	from
our	inner	ego	feeling.	Our	inner	sense	of	existence,
of	 being	 alive,	 our	 capacity	 to	 develop	 a	 state	 of
relatedness	 to	 both	 the	 human	 and	 nonhuman
environment	 (Searles	 1960)	 and	 of	 life	 having
some	 sense	 of	 meaningfulness,	 require	 a	 healthy
development	of	ego	feeling.	This	in	turn	requires
what	 Winnicott	 has	 described	 as	 good-enough
mothering.	 (See	 also	 Chessick	 1991	 for	 a
discussion	of	the	origin	of	our	sense	of	Being.)
To	 avoid	 confusion,	 note	 that	 Freud	 (1917)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
354
used	 the	 same	 term	 “ego	 feeling”	 (Ichgefühl),	 in
Mourning	and	Melancholia,	but	he	used	it	to	mean
something	 akin	 to	 self-esteem,	 which	 is	 quite
different.	 There	 is	 an	 overlap	 between	 Federn’s
concept	of	ego	feeling	and	Kohut’s	(1971)	“sense
of	 self,”	 although	 they	 are	 not	 employed	 in
compatible	theoretical	systems.

EMPATHY
Does	 empathy	 have	 a	 healing	 power,	 or	 is	 it
simply	 a	 mode	 of	 observation?	 If	 a	 person	 feels
understood	empathically	by	another	person,	does
this	 exert	 a	 healing	 effect?	 If	 so,	 how	 are	 we	 to
describe	this	healing	effect	metapsychologically?
When	we	take	the	position	of	another	person,
our	 imagination	 moves	 from	 ourselves	 into	 the
other	person.	We	may	experience	certain	changes
in	 our	 own	 muscles	 and	 actual	 physical	 posture
(Chessick	1965).	To	empathize	does	not	mean	that
the	
individual	
must	
experience	
physical
sensations;	empathy	can	be	physical,	imaginative,
or	 both.	 Fenichel	 (1945)	 quotes	 Reik,	 who
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
356
maintained	that	empathy	consists	of	two	acts,	“(a)
an	identification	with	the	other	person,	and	(b)	an
awareness	 of	 one’s	 own	 feelings	 after	 the
identification,	and	in	this	way	an	awareness	of	the
object’s	feelings”	(p.	511).
Katz	(1963)	along	with	Reik	(1949)	presented
some	metapsychologically	imprecise	and	intuitive
definitions	 and	 discussions	 of	 empathy.	 Katz
discusses	the	fielding	of	signals	through	a	“kind	of
inner	 radar”	 that	 works	 from	 cues	 in	 the
conversation	 or	 impressions	 we	 received.	 Reik
(1949)	explains	that	“in	order	to	comprehend	the
unconscious	of	another	person,	we	must,	at	least
for	a	moment,	change	ourselves	into	and	become
that	person.	We	only	comprehend	the	spirit	whom
we	resemble”	(p.	361).
Perhaps	 no	 other	 author	 before	 Kohut
emphasized	 the	 importance	 of	 empathy	 as	 much
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
357
as	 Harry	 Stack	 Sullivan.	 He	 never	 really	 defined
the	 term	 but	 spoke	 of	 empathy	 developing
through	 “induction”	 and	 postulated	 that	 the
tension	 of	 anxiety	 present	 in	 the	 mothering	 one
“induces”	 anxiety	 in	 the	 infant.	 The	 process	 by
which	this	induction	takes	place	is	referred	to	as	a
manifestation	 of	 an	 interpersonal	 process,	 which
Sullivan	
called	
empathy.	
He	
(1953)	
also
introduced	the	term	“empathic	linkage,”	meaning
a	situation	in	which	two	people	are	linked	in	such
a	way	that	one	induces	a	feeling	in	the	other.
Fromm-Reichmann	(1950)	offered	a	dramatic
clinical	 example	 of	 the	 empathic	 process.	 She
explained	how	“some	empathic	notion	for	which	I
cannot	 give	 any	 account”	 made	 her	 turn	 back
toward	 a	 patient,	 with	 consequences	 that	 later
marked	the	beginning	of	successful	therapy	of	that
patient.	 This	 example,	 like	 Sullivan’s	 definition,
leaves	 empathy	 as	 a	 rather	 mysterious	 intuitive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
358
process	 and	 demonstrates	 empathy	 by	 the
presence	of	a	response	in	the	therapist	that	can	be
observed	 by	 the	 patient	 or	 by	 an	 observer.
Fromm-Reichmann	 (1950)	 insisted	 that	 empathy
between	 the	 patient	 and	 therapist	 is	 crucial	 to
psychotherapy:	
“The	
success	
or	
failure	
of
psychoanalytic	 psychotherapy	 is,	 in	 addition,
greatly	 dependent	 upon	 the	 question	 of	 whether
or	 not	 there	 is	 actually	 an	 empathic	 quality
between	the	psychiatrist	and	the	patient”	(p.	62).
All	 seem	 to	 agree	 that	 the	 use	 of	 empathy	 in
psychotherapy	 calls	 for	 a	 pendulumlike	 action
alternating	 between	 subjective	 involvement	 and
objective	detachment.	Traditional	analysts	refer	to
this	as	a	regression	in	the	service	of	the	ego	when
it	 is	 used	 toward	 specific	 goals.	 When	 the	 good
empathizer	regresses	in	the	service	of	the	ego,	that
person	 engages	 in	 a	 playful	 kind	 of	 activity,
inwardly	imitating	events	in	the	life	of	the	patient.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
359
The	activity	is	regressive	only	in	the	sense	that	it
calls	 for	 a	 relaxed	 and	 unstructured	 experience
associated	 with	 the	 fantasy	 of	 the	 child	 or	 the
poetic	license	of	the	artist.	The	therapist	must	then
be	able	to	swing	back	to	an	objective	and	detached
relationship	 in	 order	 to	 make	 clinical	 use	 of	 the
information	gained	through	the	empathic	process.
Long	 before	 Kohut,	 Fliess	 (1942)	 explained
that	 the	 skill	 of	 the	 therapist	 depends	 on	 the
ability	 “to	 step	 into	 [the	 patient’s]	 shoes,	 and	 to
obtain	 in	 this	 way	 an	 inside	 knowledge	 that	 is
almost	 first-hand.	 The	 common	 name	 for	 such	 a
procedure	 is	 empathy”	 (pp.	 212-213).	 Levine
(1961)	claimed	that	empathy,	if	handled	correctly,
leads	to	a	type	of	immediate	comprehension	of	the
patient’s	 problems,	 a	 comprehension	 superior	 to
the	intellectual	variety	of	understanding.
French	
and	
Fromm	
(1964)	
discussed
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
360
“empathic	 thinking”	 in	 dream	 interpretation,
stressing	 “empathic	 understanding”	 as	 a	 direct
intuitive	communication	between	the	unconscious
of	the	patient	and	that	of	the	therapist.	The	patient
evokes	in	the	therapist	“an	empathic	sense	of	what
is	 going	 on”	 in	 the	 unconscious	 of	 the	 patient.
French	 and	 Fromm	 pointed	 out	 that	 there	 must
then	 occur	 a	 translation	 from	 this	 empathic
understanding	 into	 a	 language	 suitable	 for
scientific	 analysis.	 This	 translation	 is	 called
“conceptual	 analysis”	 by	 these	 authors,	 and	 thus
we	have	again	the	pendulumlike	action	described
above.
Kohut	 (1984)	 posits	 three	 functions	 for
empathy:	 (1)	 it	 is	 the	 indispensable	 tool	 of
psychoanalytic	fact	finding;	(2)	it	expands	the	self
to	 include	 the	 other,	 constituting	 a	 powerful
psychological	 bond	 between	 individuals	 in	 order
to	 counteract	 man’s	 destructiveness	 against	 his
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
361
fellows;	 and	 (3)	 it	 arises	 out	 of	 the	 selfobject
matrix,	 becoming	 the	 accepting,	 confirming,	 and
understanding	human	echo	evoked	by	and	needed
by	 the	 self	 as	 a	 psychological	 nutriment	 without
which	 human	 life	 could	 not	 be	 sustained.	 In	 this
shift	from	his	primary	definition	of	empathy	as	a
mode	 of	 observation	 or	 psychoanalytic	 fact-
finding	 to	 the	 other	 functions	 of	 empathy,	 Kohut
caused	the	greatest	controversy.
Kohut	(1971)	distinguishes	between	empathy
and	intuition.	He	defines	intuitions	as	simply	the
same	 as	 any	 other	 reactions	 and	 judgments	 of	 a
rational	 sort	 except	 that	 they	 occur	 much	 faster.
What	 appears	 to	 be	 an	 intuitive	 grasp	 of	 a
situation	is	really	a	speeded-up	series	of	rational
decisions,	such	as	those	one	may	observe	when	a
master	 chess	 player	 glances	 at	 the	 board	 and
quickly	 sees	 the	 right	 move.	 This	 process
fundamentally	differs	from	vicarious	introspection
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
362
as	a	mode	of	observation.
A	 brief	 discussion	 of	 the	 current	 scientific
status	 of	 empathy	 is	 presented	 by	 Goldberg
(1983).	He	points	out	that	there	is	a	division	in	the
psychoanalytic	literature	on	the	role	of	empathy	in
psychoanalysis.	One	view,	although	agreeing	that
empathy	may	be	desirable,	sees	it	as	a	relatively
rare	and	unreliable	phenomenon,	fraught	with	the
dangers	of	error	due	to	countertransference.	The
other	sharply	contrasting	view	sees	empathy	as	a
common	 and	 universal	 mode	 of	 communication
between	people.	Hartmann	(1927)	at	an	early	date
objected	 strongly	 to	 this	 latter	 approach	 in
psychoanalytic	 work	 and	 claimed	 that	 it	 was
unscientific	
and	
unreliable.	
But	
Goldberg
concludes	 that	 “empathy	 seems	 to	 have	 a
therapeutic	 effect	 when	 it	 is	 sustained”	 (p.	 168),
and	he	concurs	with	Kohut’s	placing	of	empathy	in
a	central	position	in	psychoanalysis.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
363
The	 entire	 subject	 of	 the	 role	 of	 empathy
within	 the	 psychoanalytic	 situation	 as	 conceived
by	various	authors	is	reviewed	by	Levy	(1985).	He
complains	
of	
the	
“multiple	
and	
different
meanings”	 (p.	 369)	 Kohut	 gave	 to	 empathy.	 He
warns	 of	 the	 transference	 gratifications	 involved
in	 Kohut’s	 positing	 a	 therapeutic	 factor	 of	 major
import	 besides	 the	 analyst’s	 interpretations.
Shapiro	(1974,	1981;	Leider	1984)	claims	that	he
does	not	even	know	what	empathy	is	and	views	it
as	 a	 form	 of	 animism	 that	 would	 destroy
psychoanalysis	as	a	science.
The	German	word	Einfühlung	was	used	in	the
late	 nineteenth	 century	 to	 describe	 aesthetic
perception	 and	 was	 translated	 into	 English	 as
“empathy.”	It	was	defined	as	“a	tendency	to	merge
the	 activities	 of	 the	 perceiving	 subject	 with	 the
qualities	of	the	perceived	object,”	as	quoted	from
Paget	 in	 1913	 by	 Reed	 (Lichtenberg,	 Bornstein,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
364
and	 Silver	 1984a,	 p.	 7).	 Reed	 gives	 seven
definitions	of	empathy	(pp.	12-13)	on	the	basis	of
carefully	cited	quotations.	Empathy	is:
1.	Both	knowledge	and	communication.
2.	Simultaneously	a	capacity,	a	process,	and	an
expression.
3.	An	ability	to	sample	others’	affects	and	to	be
able	to	respond	in	resonance	to	them.
4.	A	method	of	data	gathering.
5.	 An	 inner	 experience	 of	 sharing	 in	 and
comprehending	the	psychological	state	of
another	person.
6.	A	special	method	of	perceiving.
7.	A	means	of	communication	and	of	nonrational
understanding.
Pao	(1983)	offers	still	another	definition	from
the	Sullivanian	viewpoint:
To	 make	 use	 of	 one’s	 empathic	 capacity	 to
understand	 another	 person’s	 needs	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
365
wants	is	not	a	solo	activity.	It	is	a	process	in
which	 the	 two	 participants—the	 one	 who
desires	 to	 understand	 and	 the	 one	 who
desires	
to	
be	
understood—must	
both
participate	 actively.	 Together,	 these	 two
participants	will	gradually	set	up	a	more	and
more	 intricate	 “network”	 of	 connected
communication.	[pp.	152-153]
Basch	 (1983)	 views	 empathic	 understanding
as	 a	 complex	 process.	 He	 emphasizes	 vicarious
introspection	but	argues	that	it	is	not	a	subjective
or	untestable	phenomenon.	Basch	disagrees	with
Kohut’s	idea	that	empathy	is	curative	in	itself	and
insists,	more	traditionally,	that	cure	is	the	function
of	interpretation.	Lichtenberg	et	al.	(1984a,b)	have
devoted	 two	 volumes	 to	 various	 studies	 of
empathy,	the	reader	is	referred	to	these	for	details
of	 the	 controversy	 on	 the	 topic,	 which	 remains
quite	current.	For	example,	Levy	(1985)	argues	at
length	that	the	concept	of	empathy	does	not	have	a
specific	 technical	 meaning,	 involves	 unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
366
material,	and	is	a	much	more	tricky	phenomenon
than	Kohut	(1977)	thought	it	was.	In	his	judgment,
this	 makes	 it	 too	 diffuse	 a	 concept	 on	 which	 to
build	a	theory.

ENVY
(see	also	PENIS	ENVY)
Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 envy	 as	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
369
hatred	 of	 another	 for	 that	 person’s	 excellence,
happiness,	or	success;	grieving	at	any	qualities	of
excellence	in	another;	maliciously	withholding.	It
involves	 a	 negative	 self-assessment	 accompanied
by	 anger.	 Freud	 brought	 this	 term	 into	 the
psychiatric	 and	 popular	 psychology	 vocabulary
through	 his	 concept	 of	 penis	 envy,	 which	 he
considered	 to	 be	 central	 in	 understanding	 the
psychological	 development	 of	 women.	 Freud
(1925)	claims	that	the	girl’s	discovery	that	she	has
no	penis	is	a	wound	to	her	narcissism,	which	leads
to	a	certain	sense	of	inferiority,	jealousy,	and	the
loosening	 of	 her	 relationship	 to	 the	 mother	 as	 a
love-object.	 Consequently,	 “whereas	 in	 boys	 the
Oedipus	 complex	 is	 destroyed	 by	 the	 castration
complex,	in	girls	it	is	made	possible	and	led	up	to
by	 the	 castration	 complex”	 (p.	 256).	 Instead,	 the
little	girl	turns	to	the	father	for	a	baby.	This	leads
Freud	 to	 the	 logical	 conclusion	 that	 the	 Oedipus
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
370
complex	in	girls	escapes	the	fate	it	meets	with	in
boys—in	girls	it	may	be	slowly	abandoned	or	dealt
with	by	repression.	Freud	offers	some	disparaging
remarks	about	women	in	this	and	other	papers	on
the	topic.
The	 psychotherapist	 should	 not	 be	 misled	 by
Freud’s	 disparaging	 remarks	 about	 women	 into
ignoring	his	basic	description	of	female	sexuality.
The	 little	 girl	 is	 disappointed	 by	 the	 narcissistic
blow	that	she	has	no	penis;	she	turns	out	of	this
disappointment	 to	 her	 father	 to	 obtain	 a	 baby
from	him,	which	in	a	way	substitutes	for	the	lost
penis.	As	Freud	explains,	a	wave	of	repression	of
this	 narcissistic	 wound	 and	 the	 corresponding
wish	for	a	penis	occurs	at	puberty,	an	event	that
has	 the	 function	 of	 doing	 away	 with	 a	 large
amount	 of	 the	 girl’s	 masculine	 sexuality	 to	 make
room	for	the	development	of	her	femininity.	Along
with	 the	 blossoming	 of	 the	 feminine	 orientation,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
371
he	says,	there	is	a	shift	in	the	narcissistic	focus	on
the	 genitals	 from	 the	 clitoris	 to	 the	 vagina.	 The
existence	of	this	transfer	has	not	been	refuted	by
experimental	work	on	the	physiology	of	the	female
orgasm,	 since	 the	 transfer	 is	 primarily	 a	 normal
shift	in	narcissistic	emphasis	as	a	function	of	the
development	 of	 femininity.	 All	 of	 this	 is	 a	 highly
controversial	view	of	female	sexual	development
under	 intensive	 review	 today	 (see	 FEMALE
PSYCHOLOGY).
As	 if	 this	 controversy	 were	 not	 sufficient,
Melanie	Klein	(1957)	also	introduced	a	concept	of
envy	into	her	theories	(see	KLEIN).	In	a	paper	that
caused	 a	 sensation	 when	 it	 was	 introduced
entitled	 “Envy	 and	 Gratitude,”	 she	 declares	 that
envy	is	primary	and	constitutional.	She	writes,
For	 many	 years	 the	 envy	 of	 the	 feeding
breast	as	a	factor	which	adds	intensity	to	the
attacks	on	the	primal	object	has	been	part	of
my	 analyses.	 It	 is,	 however,	 only	 more
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
372
recently	that	I	have	laid	particular	emphasis
on	 the	 spoiling	 and	 destructive	 quality	 of
envy	 in	 so	 far	 as	 it	 interferes	 with	 the
building	up	of	a	secure	relation	to	the	good
external	and	internal	object,	undermines	the
sense	 of	 gratitude,	 and	 in	 many	 ways	 blurs
the	 distinction	 between	 good	 and	 bad.	 [p.
230]
Opponents	 of	 Melanie	 Klein	 claimed	 that	 her
postulation	 of	 constitutional	 envy	 attributed	 ego
capacities	and	cognitive	abilities	to	an	infant	that
were	 impossible	 to	 verify	 or	 even	 to	 accept.	 The
argument	over	the	existence	of	constitutional	envy
is	 one	 of	 the	 basic	 disagreements	 between
Kleinian	and	Freudian	psychoanalysts.

EROTOGENIC	ZONE,

Freud	(1905)	in	his	early	work	postulated	that
from	 certain	 areas	 of	 the	 body	 erotic	 sensations
arose	physiologically.	He	called	these	“erotogenic
zones”	and	specified	the	genitals	and	the	mucous

EVENLY	SUSPENDED	ATTENTION
Freud’s	 (1912)	 technique	 of	 listening	 with
“evenly	suspended	attention”	(p.	111)	constitutes
an	 effort	 to	 avoid	 prescinding	 from	 the	 patient’s
material	 in	 order	 to	 prevent	 the	 therapist	 from
making	 any	 selection	 out	 of	 preconceived
expectations.	He	wishes	to	avoid	the	danger	of	the
therapist’s	never	discovering	anything	that	he	or
she	does	not	already	know,	and	of	distorting	what
is	 perceived	 to	 fit	 experience-distant	 theoretical
preconceptions.
The	 question	 of	 whether	 the	 therapist	 really
can	 give	 such	 equal	 notice	 to	 everything
communicated	 by	 the	 patient	 has	 often	 been
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
375
raised,	 but	 only	 recently	 has	 it	 been	 answered
increasingly	
in	
the	
negative.	
Experienced
therapists	have	learned	that	everyone	approaches
the	
data	
provided	
by	
the	
patient’s	
free
associations	and	behavior	during	sessions	with	a
certain	 mental	 set,	 one	 that	 is	 based	 on	 either
conscious	 or	 preconscious	 personal,	 theoretical,
and	 philosophical	 conceptions.	 This	 mental	 set
determines	what	is	perceived	and	what	is	selected,
regardless	 of	 the	 therapist’s	 effort	 to	 listen	 with
evenly	suspended	attention	(Goldberg	1987)	or	to
be	 “neutral.”	 What	 we	 learn	 from	 the	 stance	 of
evenly	suspended	attention	is	enhanced	greatly	if
therapists	are	aware	of	how	their	preconceptions
influence	 all	 aspects	 of	 their	 perception	 of	 the
patient.

schisms

EXISTENTIAL	ANGUISH
It	 is	 important	 to	 distinguish	
between
“anxiety”	
as	
it	
is	
used	
in	
the	
clinical
psychotherapeutic	 sense	 and	 the	 “anxiety”	 or
“dread”	 of	 Kierkegaard	 (1946).	 Kierkegaard’s

existential	anguish	and	Freud’s	signal	anxiety	are
really	 rather	 different,	 and	 it	 confuses	 matters
considerably	 to	 include	 both	 under	 the	 term
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
377
“anxiety.”	 Kierkegaard	 (May	 1950),	 similar	 to
Freud’s	 discussion	 of	 anxiety,	 views	 existential
anguish	 developmentally,	 beginning	 with	 the
original	state	of	the	child.	But	unlike	Freud	he	does
not,	in	my	opinion,	really	pin	down	the	source	of
existential	anguish	developmentally,	believing	it	to
be	 a	 universal	 condition	 related	 to	 the	 freedom
and	 the	 possibilities	 of	 human	 decisions	 and
choices.
Kierkegaard	 and	 many	 philosophers	 who
followed	
him	
have	
overemphasized	
the
importance	of	existential	anguish	in	the	life	of	the
ordinary,	 relatively	 normal	 human	 being.	 But
existential	 anguish	 does	 often	 constitute	 an
extremely	important	complaint	from	people	who
suffer	with	emotional	difficulties.	It	is	a	conscious
derivative	of	disturbance	of	holding	and	handling
in	 the	 early	 stages	 of	 infancy,	 a	 disturbance	 that
leaves	 the	 individual,	 as	 Winnicott	 (1958)	 says,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
378
with	 a	 defective	 sense	 of	 Being,	 a	 preoccupation
with	the	meaning	of	life,	confusion	over	his	or	her
own	identity,	and	lack	of	a	place	in	the	panorama
of	human	events.
Existential	anguish,	if	prolonged,	can	lead	to	an
increasing	
sense	
of	
the	
hopelessness	
and
meaninglessness	of	life.	Kierkegaard	(Jones	1975)
gives	 an	 excellent	 description	 of	 this	 sense	 of
“melancholy”:
I	feel	so	dull	and	completely	without	joy,	my
soul	is	so	empty	and	void	that	I	cannot	even
conceive	what	could	satisfy	it—oh,	not	even
the	blessedness	of	heaven.
It	is	terrible	when	I	think,	even	for	a	single
moment,	 over	 the	 dark	 background	 which,
from	the	very	earliest	time,	was	part	of	my
life.	 The	 dread	 with	 which	 my	 father	 filled
my	soul,	his	own	frightful	melancholy,	and	all
the	things	in	this	connection	which	I	do	not
even	note	down.
From	 a	 child	 I	 was	 under	 the	 sway	 of	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
379
prodigious	 melancholy,	 the	 depth	 of	 which
finds	 its	 only	 adequate	 measure	 in	 the
equally	 prodigious	 dexterity	 I	 possessed	 of
hiding	it	under	an	apparent	gayety	and	joie
de	vivre.	[p.	211]

EXIT	LINE
Gabbard	(1982)	reminds	us	that	the	exit	line	of
the	patient	is	designed	to	leave	the	analyst	with	a
certain	 affect	 state.	 It	 may	 defend	 against
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
380
narcissistic	 injury	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 patient,	 for
example,	 in	 being	 told	 the	 time	 of	 the	 session	 is
over,	 and	 can	 be	 motivated	 by	 the	 hope	 for	 a
hostile	 triumph	 to	 torment	 the	 analyst	 after	 the
patient	 is	 gone.	 Other	 examples	 are	 the	 “curtain
call”	exit	line,	in	which	the	patient	shows	his	or	her
true	self	at	the	end;	the	“last-second	question,”	in
which	the	patient	attempts	to	catch	the	analyst	off
guard	 and	 get	 personal	 information;	 and	 the
“stereotyped	 exit,”	 a	 character	 defense	 against
being	affected	by	the	analysis.	There	are	also	the
obvious	comments,	“I’m	glad	the	session	is	over,”
or	 “I’ll	 collapse	 out	 there,”	 or	 a	 reparation
comment	 such	 as,	 “I’m	 sorry	 I	 gave	 you	 a	 hard
time.”
An	 astute	 psychotherapist	 should	 also	 watch
his	or	her	own	exit	line,	which	often	slips	out	as
the	
patient	
leaves	
and	
expresses
countertransference.

EXTERNALIZATION
Credit	for	coining	the	term	is	usually	given	to
Anna	Freud	(1965),	who	described	externalization
as	
a	
subspecies	
of	
transference	
(see
TRANSFERENCE).	 She	 viewed	 externalization	 in
child	analysis	as	a	process	in	which	the	person	of
the	analyst	is	used	to	represent	one	or	the	other
part	of	the	patient’s	personality	structure.
The	 concept	 of	 externalization	 was	 expanded
by	Brodey	(1965).	In	his	experience	while	working
with	 family	 units,	 externalization	 appeared	 as	 a
mechanism	 of	 defense	 defined	 by	 the	 following
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
382
characteristics:
1.	Projection	is	combined	with	the	manipulation
of	 reality	 selected	 for	 the	 purpose	 of
verifying	the	projection.
2.	The	reality	that	cannot	be	used	to	verify	the
projection	is	not	perceived.
3.	 Information	 known	 by	 the	 externalizing
person	is	not	transmitted	to	others	except
as	it	is	useful	to	train	or	manipulate	them
into	validating	what	will	then	become	the
realization	of	the	projection.
The	 psychotherapist	 feels	 the	 intensity	 of	 the
patient’s	 effort	 to	 manipulate	 him	 or	 her	 into
validating	 projections.	 He	 or	 she	 feels	 conflict	 in
the	 struggle	 against	 this	 manipulation,	 but
behavior	that	will	be	used	as	validation	seems	the
only	 way	 to	 gain	 a	 relationship	 with	 the	 patient.
The	 manipulation	 of	 the	 therapist	 into	 behavior
that	 is	 symmetrical	 to	 the	 projection	 is	 different
from	the	simple	transfer	of	feelings	to	a	therapist.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
383
It	 implies	 an	 interpersonal	 process.	 Even	 the
therapist’s	
active	
denial	
of	
the	
patient’s
presumption	is	used	by	the	patient	in	the	service
of	 proving	 to	 the	 patient	 that	 the	 therapist	 is
actually	 congruent	 with	 his	 or	 her	 projective
image.
Brodey	points	out	that	the	therapist	of	the	ego-
disturbed	
patient	
must	
become	
skilled	
at
managing	his	or	her	congruence	with	the	patient’s
projected	 image.	 This	 management	 is	 often
intuitive	and	usually	very	demanding	emotionally,
since	 the	 temptation	 to	 yield	 is	 strong:	 “Being	 a
distorted	 object	 is	 much	 easier	 than	 being
nonexistent”	(p.	169).
Externalization	is	a	combination	of	projection
followed	by	selective	perception	and	manipulation
of	 other	 people	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 verifying	 the
initial	 projection.	 Other	 people	 are	 experienced
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
384
wholly	 in	 terms	 of	 their	 value	 in	 verifying	 the
initial	projection,	and	only	those	aspects	of	other
people	which	have	this	value	are	perceived	at	all.
For	 example,	 even	 the	 most	 benign	 therapist
approaching	 the	 borderline	 patient	 may	 find
himself	 or	 herself	 transformed	 into	 a	 horrible
monster	 very	 quickly	 by	 the	 patient’s	 selective
perception	
(see	
BORDERLINE).	
Unless	
the
therapist	is	aware	of	this	danger,	he	or	she	will	be
inclined	either	to	retaliate	or	to	quarrel	with	the
patient’s	 extremely	 unflattering	 image	 of	 the
therapist,	which	usually	contains	a	kernel	of	truth
and	a	direct	assault	on	the	therapist’s	narcissistic
conception	 of	 himself	 or	 herself	 as	 a	 benevolent
physician	(Chessick	1972).
Giovacchini	 (1967)	 emphasizes	 paradoxical
self-defeating	 behavior	 with	 a	 defensive	 purpose
that	 is	 usually	 the	 result	 of	 externalization.	 This
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
self-defeating
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
385
behavior	 resulting	 from	 a	 breakdown	 of	 the
personality.	A	patient	of	this	type	cannot	cope	with
a	 warm	 and	 nonthreatening	 environment.	 He	 or
she	expects	and	brings	about	failure,	and	adapts	to
life	 by	 feeling	 beaten	 in	 an	 unpredictable	 and
ungiving	 world.	 Giovacchini	 distinguishes	 this
from	a	masochistic	adjustment	and	points	out	the
relationship	 of	 externalization	 to	 the	 repetition
compulsion,	
on	
which	
it	
is	
based	
(see
COMPULSION	
TO	
REPEAT).	
Externalization
contains	a	mode	of	adaptation	or	adjustment	that
makes	 any	 interaction	 between	 the	 ego	 and	 the
outer	 world	 possible,	 and	 characterizes	 that
interaction	as	doomed	to	disappointment.

FAIRBAIRN
(see	QUASI-INDEPENDENCE)
FALSE	SELF
(see	also	WINNICOTT)
For	R.	D.	Laing	(1969),	patients	with	what	he
calls	
“ontological	
insecurity”	
substitute
dependency	 on	 the	 other	 for	 genuine	 mutuality.
The	 schizoid	 patient	 oscillates	 between	 merger
and	 isolation,	 not,	 as	 in	 the	 normal	 person,
between	
relatedness	
and	
separation	
(sec

SCHIZOID).	The	patient	splits	into	a	secret	true	self
and	a	body	associated	with	a	false	self.	This	false
self	 system	 was	 borrowed	 from	 Kierkegaard’s
(1946)	
concept	
of	
“shut-up-ness.”	
For
Kierkegaard,	the	“shut-up”	is	the	mute;	he	or	she
does	not	wish	to	communicate	and	feels	dread	if
required	to	do	so.
This	 definitive	 split	 becomes	 a	 basic	 and
irreversible	schizoid	style.	The	patient	tries	to	do
everything	for	himself	or	herself	in	isolation.	The
advantage	 of	 this	 is	 that	 it	 protects	 the	 patient
from	 ontological	 insecurity	 and	 the	 anxieties
associated	 with	 it.	 The	 disadvantage	 is	 that	 it	 is
impossible,	 since	 we	 all	 need	 other	 people;
isolation	of	one’s	self	leads	to	despair	and	a	sense
of	emptiness	and	alienation	from	the	world.	Laing
(1969)	writes,	“The	more	the	self	is	defended	this
way,	the	more	it	is	cut	off	and	destroyed”	(pp.	80-
81).

To	 get	 a	 better	 understanding	 of	 Laing’s
concept,	 it	 is	 worth	 comparing	 three	 different
types	 of	 false	 self	 systems.	 In	 the	 normal
individual,	 some	 behavior	 is	 mechanical,	 but	 the
person	 is	 not	 compelled	 to	 it	 and	 there	 is	 no
encroachment	 on	 spontaneity	 and	 no	 feeling	 of
being	 lived	 in	 contrast	 to	 living.	 In	 the	 neurotic
individual,	such	as	the	hysteric,	there	is	bad	faith,
as	Sartre	(1973)	calls	it.	This	is	a	way	of	life	aimed
at	taboo	gratification.	The	individual	“pretends”	to
himself	 or	 herself	 and	 to	 others.	 The	 schizoid’s
false	 self	 system,	 however,	 is	 aimed	 not	 at
gratification	but	at	preservation.	It	involves	hiding
fear	 and	 hatred,	 being	 compulsively	 compliant,
being	 good,	 and	 not	 making	 trouble.	 This
compliance	 poses	 one	 of	 the	 most	 difficult
defensive	systems	encountered	in	psychoanalytic
treatment	 and	 is	 often	 the	 source	 of	 therapeutic
stalemate	when	it	is	overlooked	by	the	therapist.

FANTASY
(see	also	PHANTASY)
The	 current	 controversies	 about	 the	 exact
nature	 and	 metapsychological	 status	 of	 early
fantasy	formations	have	been	covered	recently	in
a	 series	 of	 papers	 (Abend	 1990,	 Dowling	 1990,
Inderbitziw	 and	 Levy	 1990,	 Shane	 and	 Shane
1990,	Shapiro	1990,	Trosman	1990).	Suffice	it	to
say	 here	 that	 behind	 the	 fixed	 and	 organized
repressed	unconscious	fantasies	is	what	Dowling
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
391
(1990)	
calls	
“the	
blurred,	
undifferentiated
preconceptual	 thought	 of	 early	 oedipal	 and
preoedipal	
life,”	
that	
perhaps	
includes
“sensorimotor	 or	 behavioral	 memories,	 which
arise	 primarily	 from	 preverbal	 experience	 and
remain	influential	throughout	childhood	and	adult
life”	(p.	109).	Indeed,	sometimes	the	first	clue	to
such	 fantasies	 appears	 in	 the	 patient’s	 behavior
rather	than	in	his	or	her	verbalization	during	the
analytic	process.	These	fantasies	differ	from	other
unconscious	content	in	“their	enduring	quality	and
their	 organized,	 story-like	 quality	 reflecting	 the
distortions	 typical	 of	 the	 primary	 process”	 and
form	 “dynamically	 unconscious	 templates	 from
the	childhood	past”	that	“are	relatively	impervious
to	new	experience”	(Inderbitziw	and	Levy	1990,	p.
113).
Arlow	(1985)	stresses	that	after	the	age	of	6	or
7	everyone	has	a	unique	typical	repetitive	fantasy
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
392
activity,	 of	 which	 their	 adult	 fantasy	 life	 reflects
derivatives.	Even	our	perception	is	determined	by
this	 crucial	 unconscious	 fantasy	 activity,	 which
forms	 “the	 mental	 set	 against	 which	 the	 data	 of
perception	are	perceived,	registered,	interpreted,
remembered,	 and	 responded	 to”	 (p.	 526).	 These
fantasies	
go	
through	
convolutions	
as	
the
individual	develops,	and	some	later	editions	may
even	 provide	 defensive	 distortions	 of	 earlier
fantasies.	Arlow	writes:
In	the	course	of	treatment	one	can	observe
how	 the	 symptoms	 of	 the	 patient’s	 illness,
how	his	life	history	and	his	love	relations,	his
character	structure	and	his	artistic	creations
may	
all	
represent	
in	
different	
ways
derivative	 manifestations	 of	 the	 persistent
unconscious	
fantasy	
activity,	
of	
the
“fantasied	
reality”	
that	
governs	
the
individual’s	life.	[p.	534]
Arlow	 views	 the	 analyst’s	 behavior	 as	 a
stimulus,	 as	 a	 day	 residue,	 but	 it	 is	 through	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
393
stimulation	 of	 the	 patient’s	 unconscious	 fantasy
life	that	the	reaction	we	call	transference	occurs.
Even	 in	 the	 transference,	 at	 least	 at	 first,	 we	 see
only	 derivatives	 of	 the	 persistent	 unconscious
fantasy	 activity	 of	 childhood	 that	 governs	 the
individual’s	life.
I	(Chessick,	in	press)	agree	with	this	out	of	my
own	 clinical	 experience.	 At	 the	 core	 of	 every
patient	 there	 resides	 a	 crucial	 fantasy	 activity
process	
interwoven	
with	
early	
infantile
experiences	 to	 a	 greater	 or	 lesser	 degree,
depending	 on	 how	 traumatic	 these	 experiences
have	 been.	 But,	 as	 Arlow	 (1985)	 explains,	 “What
constitutes	 trauma	 is	 not	 inherent	 in	 the	 actual,
real	event,	but	rather	the	individual’s	response	to
the	 disorganizing,	 disruptive	 combination	 of
impulses	 and	 fears	 integrated	 into	 a	 set	 of
unconscious	 fantasies”	 (p.	 533).	 Certain	 object
relations	 and	 self	 psychology	 theories	 tend	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
394
minimize	the	role	of	this	unconscious	activity	and
emphasize	the	pathogenic	effect	of	real	events	and
interactions.	 But	 the	 individual’s	 experience,
explains	 Arlow	 (1980),	 “is	 usually	 organized	 in
terms	 of	 a	 few	 leading	 unconscious	 fantasies
which	dominate	an	individual’s	perception	of	the
world	and	create	the	mental	set	by	which	she	or
he	 perceives	 and	 interprets	 her/his	 experience”
(p.	 131).	 Transference	 is	 not	 a	 repetition	 of	 the
patient’s	 early	 interactions	 with	 present	 objects,
but	
expresses	
derivatives	
of	
the	
patient’s
persistent	 unconscious	 childhood	 fantasies,	 the
“psychic	reality”	of	these	early	interactions	for	the
patient.

FEE
The	subject	of	the	setting	and	collection	of	fees
in	 psychotherapy	 and	 psychoanalysis	 has	 not
received	the	attention	it	deserves.	Eissler	(1974)
has	written	the	best	paper	on	the	topic	to	date.	He
recommends	 that	 analysts	 set	 an	 initial	 optimal
fee	 and	 points	 out	 that	 the	 analyst’s	 behavior	 in
setting	 the	 fee	 and	 collecting	 it	 is	 an	 important
indicator	 to	 the	 patient	 of	 the	 professional’s
attitude	toward	money.	This	attitude	can	be	either
a	function	of	the	analyst’s	consideration	for	what
is	 best	 for	 the	 patient	 or	 a	 function	 of	 an
unresolved	 narcissistic	 problem	 of	 the	 analyst.
Eissler	 mentions	 that	 younger	 analysts	 are
especially	vulnerable	to	the	latter	because	they	are
upwardly	 mobile	 and	 wish	 to	 be	 financially
comfortable	as	soon	as	possible.
Eissler	 recommends	 scrupulous	 honesty	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
397
objects	 to	 increasing	 the	 fee	 as	 indexed	 to
inflation.	 His	 paper	 was	 written	 before	 the	 more
serious	 inflationary	 changes	 in	 today’s	 economy,
so	 some	 therapists	 may	 legitimately	 choose	 to
warn	 the	 patient	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 treatment
that	there	will	be	an	increase	in	fee	from	time	to
time	 based	 on	 inflation.	 For	 example,	 if	 there	 is
substantial	 inflation	 in	 a	 year	 (over	 5	 percent),	 I
will	increase	the	fee	of	a	once-a-week	patient	on
an	annual	basis.	But	a	patient	coming	three	or	four
times	 a	 week	 should	 not	 have	 the	 fee	 increased
more	than	once	every	three	or	four	years,	and	this
should	be	done	carefully,	if	at	all.	The	handling	of
the	 fee	 increase	 is	 a	 matter	 of	 the	 personal
characteristics	of	the	analyst,	but	it	is	an	important
signal	to	the	patient	of	whether	the	analyst	really
is	or	is	not	considering	the	patient’s	needs	above
his	or	her	own.
It	is	possible	for	the	analyst	to	err	in	the	other
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
398
direction,	 by	 setting	 too	 low	 a	 fee.	 This	 can	 be	 a
serious	 problem	 because,	 if	 the	 patient	 is	 aware
that	he	or	she	is	paying	a	very	low	fee	as	compared
to	 others	 in	 treatment,	 the	 patient	 may	 feel
obligated	 not	 to	 get	 angry	 at	 this	 kindly,
benevolent	parent	figure	who	is	doing	this	favor.	I
have	had	several	patients	in	reanalysis	who	were
unable	 to	 express	 their	 rage	 at	 their	 previous
analysts	 because	 the	 fee	 was	 set	 low	 and	 the
analysts	announced	this	fact	to	the	patients	at	the
beginning	of	the	sessions.	The	patients	took	this	as
a	 declaration	 of	 benevolence	 and	 kindliness	 and
felt	throughout	the	treatment	that	they	could	not
directly	lose	their	temper;	as	a	result,	the	analysis
floundered.	However,	if	one	must	err,	it	is	better	to
set	too	low	rather	than	a	crushingly	high	fee,	and
better	to	lose	by	the	inflation	than	to	raise	the	fee
to	hardship	levels	for	the	patient.
I	believe	that	in	all	cases	the	therapist	must	be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
399
prepared	 to	 substantially	 lower	 the	 fee	 if	 the
patient	 becomes	 disabled	 or	 suffers	 financial
reverses	 or	 burdens	 that	 are	 not	 the	 result	 of
acting	out	or	manipulation	or	provocation	but	are
genuinely	beyond	the	patient’s	control.	This	is	part
of	 the	 physicianly	 vocation	 (see	 PHYSICIANLY
VOCATION).

FEMALE	PSYCHOLOGY
In	the	area	of	classical	psychoanalytic	theory,
no	 set	 of	 concepts	 has	 come	 under	 as	 much
criticism	
from	
clinical	
and	
observational
experience	 as	 Freud’s	 psychoanalytic	 view	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
400
feminine	psychology.	It	is	very	important	for	the
modern	 practicing	 psychotherapist	 to	 have	 a
thorough	 understanding	 of	 the	 issues	 that	 are
involved.
Although	
Freud	
assumed	
in	
his	
early
formulations	that	sexual	development	in	boys	and
girls	 was	 similar	 (see	 Table	 1),	 in	 his	 later
formulations	 he	 maintained	 that	 the	 Oedipus
complex	in	the	girl	was	a	much	more	complicated
process.	 According	 to	 classical	 Freudian	 theory,
the	
divergence	
between	
the	
psychosexual
development	of	the	boy	and	the	girl	appears	early
in	 the	 phallic	 phase.	 Before	 then,	 the	 girl	 shares
with	the	boy	the	passive	position	in	relation	to	her
mother.	 With	 the	 development	 of	 motility	 and
locomotion	 both	 enter	 an	 increasingly	 active
phase,	 with	 the	 emphasis	 on	 autonomy	 and
mastery	of	the	object	world.	At	this	point,	a	basic
developmental	divergence	takes	place.

Table	 1.	 Freud’s	 Changing	 Views	 on	 Female
Sexuality
1. Unfathomable,	But…
a. 1905:	Three	Essays	on	Sexuality—“impenetrable
obscurity”	of	erotic	life	of	women	(S.E.	7,	p.	151),	but
sexuality	of	little	girls	is	wholly	masculine,	they	undergo	a
more	complex	and	difficult	development;	clitoral-vaginal
transfer	theory	introduced	(S.E.	7,	pp.	219-221).
b. 1923:	The	Infantile	Genital	Organization—is	phallic	in	both
sexes	(S.E.	19,	p.	143),	and	the	processes	of	the	phallic
phase	unknown	in	women.	But	at	preoedipal	level	the
polarities	are	male	genital	vs.	castrated	(disavowal
introduced	p.	143),	and	only	on	completion	of	puberty
does	it	become	male,	active	vs.	female,	passive.
c. 1926:	The	Problem	of	Lay	Analysis—“the	sexual	life	of
adult	women	is	a	'dark	continent'	for	psychology”	(S.E.	20.
p.	212).
2. Penis	Envy
a. 1908:	The	Sexual	Theories	of	Children	(S.E.	9,	pp.	217-218).
b. 1918:	The	Taboo	of	Virginity	(S.E.	11).	Bondage	and
hostility	to	men.
c. 1916:	Some	Character	Types—stresses	injury	to
narcissism	and	rage	at	mother	(S.E.	14,	p.	315).
3. Less	Ego	Development	(Possibly)
a. 1920:	Psychogenesis	of	a	case	of	homosexuality	in	a
woman—women	are	less	objective,	less	lucid,	less	astute,
“but	these	distinctions	are	conventional	rather	than
scientific"	(S.E.	18,	p.	154).
4. Outcome	of	Oedipus	Complex,	Including	Superego,	Is	Exactly
the	Same	as	Boys
a. 1900:	Interpretation	of	Dreams	(S.E.	4.	p.	257).
b. 1916-1917:	Introductory	Lectures	on	Psychoanalysis	(S.E.
16,	Lect.	21)
c. 1923:	The	Ego	and	the	Id—“a	precise	analogy”	in	character
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
402
development	of	males	and	females	as	a	function	of	the
dissolution	of	the	Oedipus	complex	(S.E.	19,	p.	32).
5. The	Outcome	Is	Different	in	Women
a. 1919:	A	Child	Is	Being	Beaten—not	satisfied	with	the
“precise	analogy”:	“the	expectation	of	there	being	a
complete	parallel	was	mistaken”	(S.E.	17,	p.	196).
b. 1924:	The	Dissolution	of	the	Oedipus	Complex—women
have	less	sadism	and	are	more	affectionate,	connected
with	“stunted	growth	of	her	penis”	(S.E.	19,	p.	179).	“It
must	be	admitted,	however,	that	in	general	our	insight
into	these	developmental	processes	in	girls	is
unsatisfactory,	incomplete,	and	vague”	(ibid).
6. Findings	Are	Tentative—Final	Views
a. 1931:	On	Female	Sexuality	(S.E.	21)—stresses	importance
of	preoedipal	attachment	to	the	mother	and	opens
investigation	of	preoedipal	period	as	setting	scene	for	the
oedipal.
b. 1933:	New	Series	of	Lectures—“Femininity"	(S.E.	22,	Lect.
33)—very	depreciating	view	of	women.
7. Women	Are	Different	and	Inferior—Victorian	Prejudice
a. 1925:	Some	Psychic	Consequences	of	Anatomical
Differences—complete	reassessment	of	views,	elaborating
on	1924	paper.	Women	have	more	jealousy	(S.E.	19,	p.
254)	and	are	ethically	inferior	(pp.	257-258).
b. 1937:	Analysis	Terminable	and	Interminable—penis	envy
“bedrock”	(S.E.	23).
c. 1940:	Outline	of	Psychoanalysis—patriarchal	and
condescending	views,	his	final	statement	(S.E.	23,	Ch.	7,
e.g.,	p.	194).
The	 girl	 has	 to	 change	 not	 only	 her	 sexual
object	from	the	woman	or	mother	to	the	man	or
father,	but	her	leading	genital	zone	as	well—from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
403
the	 clitoris	 to	 the	 vagina.	 This	 stands	 in	 sharp
contrast	 to	 the	 boy,	 whose	 sexual	 development
remains	 simpler	 in	 that	 his	 leading	 genital	 zone
remains	the	phallus	and	the	sexual	object	remains
a	woman.	For	many	years	Freudians	assumed	that
the	vagina	was	virtually	nonexistent	and	possibly
did	 not	 produce	 sensations	 until	 puberty.	 The
sexual	 life	 of	 women	 was	 divided,	 according	 to
classical	psychoanalytic	theory,	into	two	phases,	of
which	the	first	has	a	masculine	character	and	only
the	 second	 is	 specifically	 feminine.	 In	 female
development	there	is	a	process	of	transition	from
one	phase	to	the	other,	to	which	there	is	nothing
analogous	 in	 the	 male.	 The	 matter	 is	 further
complicated	 because	 the	 clitoris	 continues	 to
function	in	later	female	sexual	life	in	a	manner	that
is	quite	variable	and	not	satisfactorily	understood.
Along	 with	 this	 great	 difference	 in	 genital
zones	 there	 is	 another	 concerning	 the	 finding	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
404
the	object.	The	girl	has	her	mother	as	first	object,
just	 like	 the	 boy;	 but	 at	 the	 end	 of	 her
development,	the	father,	a	man,	becomes	the	new
love	object.	According	to	Freud	(1925),	“	Whereas
in	 boys	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 is	 destroyed	 by	 the
castration	complex,	in	girls	it	is	made	possible	and
led	up	to	by	the	castration	complex”	(p.	256).	Thus
the	 castration	 complex	 inhibits	 and	 limits
masculinity	 and	 encourages	 femininity	 (sec
CASTRATION	ANXIETY	and	OEDIPUS	COMPLEX).
This	 is	 further	 elaborated	 in	 classical	 theory,
where	it	is	postulated	that	the	narcissistic	wound
in	the	girl	from	her	discovery	of	the	lack	of	a	penis
tends	 to	 bring	 about	 the	 giving	 up	 of	 clitoral
sexuality	for	the	development	of	“femininity.”	The
girl’s	libido	slips	into	a	new	position;	at	this	point
the	Oedipus	complex	begins	to	play	its	part.	The
basic	 equation	 is	 that	 penis	 equals	 child,	 and	 for
the	purpose	of	getting	a	child,	she	now	takes	her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
405
father	as	love	object	and	the	mother	becomes	the
object	of	her	jealousy.	She	turns	to	her	father,	but
this	attraction	to	him	is	secondary	to	her	wish	to
obtain	 a	 baby	 from	 him.	 Whereas	 in	 boys	 the
Oedipus	 complex	 is	 destroyed,	 in	 girls	 it	 escapes
this	fate	because	the	girl	is	already	castrated.	The
Oedipus	 complex	 may	 be	 slowly	 abandoned	 or
dealt	with	by	repression,	or	its	effects	may	persist
far	into	a	woman’s	normal	mental	life.
Thus	 the	 girl	 has	 an	 early	 identification	 with
the	 active	 mother	 that	 is	 an	 initial	 active
(negative)	 oedipal	 position.	 Then	 the	 girl	 turns
with	the	passive	aim	to	the	oedipal	love	object,	the
father,	which	forms	the	passive	(positive)	oedipal
position;	 this	 occurs	 relatively	 late	 compared	 to
the	 boy’s	 active	 (positive)	 oedipal	 position.	 In
turning	from	the	mother	to	the	father,	according	to
this	 theory,	 the	 girl	 turns	 from	 an	 active	 to	 a
passive	 sexual	 position.	 Passivity	 then	 becomes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
406
the	 normal	 sexual	 orientation	 for	 the	 girl.
Furthermore,	 the	 very	 recognition	 of	 castration,
which	in	the	boy	brings	on	the	destruction	of	the
Oedipus	 complex,	 in	 the	 girl	 brings	 the	 Oedipus
complex	
into	
existence,	
and	
no	
force	
or
circumstance	 similar	 to	 the	 one	 that	 makes	 the
boy	 renounce	 his	 oedipal	 wishes	 exists	 in	 the
situation	of	the	girl.
Blos	(1962)	explains	that	as	the	limitations	of
physical	immaturity,	incestuous	guilt	feelings,	and
the	 persistent	 narcissistic	 injury	 experienced	 in
masturbatory	activity	eventually	combine	to	bring
about	a	decline	of	the	girl’s	oedipal	fantasies	and
facilitate	her	entrance	into	the	latency	period,	so
the	 resolution	 of	 the	 girl’s	 Oedipus	 complex	 may
not	come	about	until	her	adolescence	or	perhaps
even	 later	 with	 the	 birth	 of	 a	 child,	 or	 perhaps
never	at	all	in	any	complete	fashion.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
407
This	theory	led	with	superficial	logic	to	some
of	 Freud’s	 depreciating	 remarks	 about	 the
superego	 in	 women.	 Muslin	 (1971)	 carefully
reviews	 the	 entire	 matter,	 pointing	 out	 that	 it	 is
not	necessary	to	reach	any	conclusions	about	any
kind	of	inferiority	of	superego	function	in	women
from	 basic	 psychoanalytic	 theory.	 Although	 the
superego	of	a	woman	may	be	unique	as	compared
to	the	superego	of	a	man,	superego	functioning	is
normally	similar	and	effective	in	both	sexes.
Conclusions	 from	 Freud’s	 basic	 postulates
about	 female	 sexuality	 involve	 the	 three	 final
pathways	that	feminine	sexuality	may	take:	(a)	a
general	revulsion	from	sexuality,	(b)	a	defiant	self-
assertiveness	 in	 which	 the	 girl	 clings	 to	 her
threatened	 masculinity	 in	 the	 hope	 of	 getting	 a
penis	and	to	the	fantasy	of	being	a	man	(the	so-
called	 phallic	 woman),	 and	 (c)	 a	 circuitous
development	in	which	the	girl	takes	her	father	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
408
her	object	and	finds	her	way	to	the	feminine	form
of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex.	 Only	 the	 third	 path,
according	 to	 Freud,	 leads	 to	 the	 final	 normal
female	attitude.
Certain	additions	were	made	to	Freud’s	basic
postulates,	some	of	them	even	in	Freud’s	lifetime
and	 with	 his	 approval.	 For	 example,	 Ruth	 Mack-
Brunswick	 (Fliess	 1948),	 one	 of	 the	 early	 female
classical	psychoanalysts,	stressed	the	anger	at	the
mother	 that	 the	 oedipal	 girl	 feels	 when	 she
discovers	that	she	does	not	have	a	penis.	The	girl
abandons	the	mother	as	love	object	with	far	more
embitterment	and	finality	than	does	the	boy;	this
tremendous	anger	at	the	mother,	Mack-Brunswick
said,	 is	 also	 expressed	 in	 feminine	 masochism.
Masochism	is	seen	as	a	normal	part	of	femininity
and	 a	 consequence	 of	 the	 defense	 against	 the
anger	of	the	mother.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
409
A	
complete	
exposition	
of	
the	
classical
psychoanalytic	position	on	feminine	sexuality	is	to
be	found	in	the	various	works	of	Helene	Deutsch.
Several	 of	 her	 papers	 are	 reprinted	 in	 Fliess’s
(1948)	Psychoanalytic	Reader;	her	expanded	views
are	 in	 her	 two-volume	 Psychology	 of	 Women
(1944).	Deutsch	(1973)	played	an	interesting	role
in	 the	 history	 of	 the	 psychoanalytic	 movement.
She	 explains	 in	 her	 autobiography	 that	 “three	 of
Freud’s	women	pupils	achieved	a	certain	degree	of
prominence	 as	 ‘pioneers	 in	 feminine	 psychology’
(that	was	the	phrase	Freud	used	in	his	writings).
These	were	Ruth	Mack-Brunswick,	Jeanne	Lampl-
de	Groot,	and	myself’	(pp.	137-138).
Deutsch	maintains	that	parturition	constitutes
for	women	the	termination	of	a	sexual	act	that	was
only	
inaugurated	
by	
coitus.	
The	
ultimate
gratification	of	the	erotic	instinct	in	women	takes
place	 at	 the	 point	 of	 giving	 birth.	 Femininity	 for
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
410
Deutsch	 means	 the	 feminine,	 placid,	 masochistic
disposition	in	the	mental	life	of	women.	The	basic
feminine	fantasy,	according	to	Deutsch,	is,	“I	want
to	be	castrated	and	raped	by	my	father	and	to	have
a	 child	 by	 him,”	 a	 threefold	 wish	 of	 plainly
masochistic	 character.	 Castration,	 rape,	 and
parturition	are	mixed	together	as	basic	elements
in	feminine	psychology.	The	masochistic	fantasies
and	 wish	 for	 a	 child	 are	 permeated	 by	 pleasure
tendencies	
of	
a	
masochistic	
nature.	
This
masochism	 is	 a	 defensive	 consequence	 of	 the
bitterness	 toward	 the	 mother	 generated	 by	 the
girl’s	discovery	that	she	has	no	penis.	This	wish	for
castration,	 rape,	 and	 parturition	 is	 termed	 by
some	authors	the	masochistic	triad	in	the	female.
A	whole	series	of	clinical	objections	has	been
made	to	these	basic	theoretical	conceptions	about
feminine	psychology.	Gardiner	(1955)	discusses	in
detail	 the	 subject	 of	 feminine	 masochism	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
411
passivity.	 Is	 this	 a	 need	 or	 a	 culturally	 enforced
tendency	
in	
women	
to	
repress	
their
aggressiveness	 more	 than	 men?	 Is	 it	 really	 true
that	 femininity	 and	 masochism	 are	 inextricably
connected,	as	Deutsch	says	they	are?	When	the	girl
begins	 to	 accept	 the	 fact	 that	 her	 clitoris	 is	 an
inferior	
organ	
and	
incapable	
of	
actively
penetrating,	 the	 wish	 may	 develop	 passively	 to
receive	 caresses	 and	 stimulation	 from	 the	 love
object	and	eventually,	by	way	of	the	father’s	penis,
a	child	instead	of	the	penis,	which	has	been	taken
away	from	her	or	denied	her.	But	this	is	hardly	a
wish	for	pain	or	suffering.	Gardiner	points	out	that
it	seems	rather	a	wish	for	libidinal	pleasure	that
can	 be	 achieved	 passively,	 and	 indeed	 the	 child
experiences	 receiving	 pleasure	 passively	 in	 the
mother’s	 physical	 care	 and	 caresses	 during	 the
preoedipal	phase.	An	instinctual	wish	for	a	child	is
then	reinforced	by	the	equation	penis	equals	child
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
412
or	child	equals	penis.
Gardiner	 also	 questions	 Deutsch’s	 (Fliess
1948)	 concept	 that	 parturition	 is	 for	 the	 woman
an	orgy	of	masochistic	pleasure.	When	pain	occurs
in	pregnancy	or	giving	birth,	this	is	a	reality	and
must	be	suffered	for	the	sake	of	the	result,	but	it	is
normally	not	enjoyed	for	itself.	Also,	the	pleasure
in	 the	 sexual	 act	 is	 direct	 and	 immediate	 and
except	perhaps	at	defloration	and	for	a	short	time
thereafter,	 intercourse	 for	 the	 normal	 woman	 is
without	pain.	Here	the	pleasure	principle	pure	and
simple	 is	 at	 work.	 When	 a	 normal	 Oedipus
complex	develops	and	there	is	no	regression	to	the
anal-sadistic	 or	 oral	 stage,	 Gardiner	 feels	 we
should	 not	 expect	 to	 find	 more	 than	 a	 trace	 of
masochism	or	sadism.
Ash	 (1971)	 argues	 that	 Freud’s	 concept,
femininity	implies	passivity,	was	simply	a	cultural
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
413
prejudice	 and	 nothing	 more.	 In	 the	 New
Introductory	 Lectures	 on	 Psychoanalysis,	 Freud
(1933)	 himself	 expressed	 reservations	 about
equating	 femininity	 with	 passivity.	 In	 that	 work
his	struggle	with	inner	contradictions	in	his	theory
becomes	 especially	 evident,	 as	 he	 describes	 how
the	suppression	of	women’s	aggressiveness,	which
is	 prescribed	 for	 them	 constitutionally	 and
imposed	on	them	socially,	favors	the	development
of	powerful	masochistic	impulses.
These	two	major	objections	to	Freud’s	theory
—femininity	does	not	have	to	imply	masochism	or
the	wish	for	masochistic	orgy	and	femininity	does
not	necessarily	have	to	imply	passivity—are	based
on	 clinical	 and	 social	 observations	 but	 do	 not
threaten	 the	 basic	 theory	 itself;	 they	 merely
require	modifications.	Over	the	past	twenty	years,
however,	 objections	 have	 occurred	 that	 threaten
Freud’s	whole	theory	of	feminine	psychology.	For
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
414
example,	Sherfey	(1973)	makes	an	extreme	attack
on	the	psychoanalytic	concept	of	female	sexuality.
Her	position	consists	of	three	major	theses:	(a)	the
early	embryo	of	all	human	beings	is	female;	(b)	by
the	nature	of	their	physiological	structure,	women
are	sexually	insatiable;	and	(c)	civilization	arose	as
a	means	of	suppressing	the	inordinate	demands	of
female	 sexuality	 that	 result	 from	 an	 inherent
insatiability.	 The	 first	 thesis	 challenges	 the
Freudian	 belief	 in	 an	 embryo	 that	 is	 sexually
undifferentiated	and	therefore	bisexual.	This	is,	of
course,	 vital	 in	 analytic	 theory,	 because	 Freud
assumed	 that	 the	 clitoris	 served	 as	 a	 residual
organ	 of	 the	 masculine	 element	 in	 women.	 The
second	and	third	theses	are	based	on	the	work	of
Masters	 and	 Johnson	 (1966).	 Sherfey	 takes	 their
work	to	mean	that,	from	the	standpoint	of	normal
physiologic	 functioning,	 the	 more	 orgasms	 a
woman	 has,	 the	 more	 she	 will	 continue	 to	 have,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
415
unless	inhibited	by	fatigue	or	external	repression.
Leaning	 on	 Masters	 and	 Johnson’s	 observations,
she	throws	out	the	whole	concept	that	the	transfer
from	 clitoris	 to	 vagina	 takes	 place	 in	 a	 normal
female	sexual	development	and	contends	that	the
forceful	suppression	of	women’s	inordinate	sexual
demands	
has	
led	
to	
the	
development	
of
civilization.
Fisher	 (1973)	 could	 discover	 no	 correlation
between	 the	 consistency	 with	 which	 women
achieved	orgasm	and	their	degree	of	psychological
maladjustment;	the	extent	to	which	their	mother
and	father	may	or	may	not	have	been	permissive
in	sexual	matters;	their	sexual	information	prior	to
marriage;	 their	 femininity	 as	 conventionally
defined;	
or	
their	
aggressiveness,	
passivity,
religiosity,	 or	 even	 preference	 for	 clitoral	 versus
vaginal	 stimulation.	 Furthermore,	 the	 length	 of
foreplay,	the	duration	of	coitus,	and	so	on,	have	no
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
416
consistent	 correlation	 with	 a	 woman’s	 ability	 to
achieve	 orgasms	 regularly.	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,
Fisher	attacks	the	Freudians	for	thinking	that	the
woman	 who	 prefers	 vaginal	 stimulation	 is	 more
normal	 or	 more	 mature	 than	 others,	 and	 he
emphasizes	the	importance	of	male	dependability
as	a	determining	factor	in	the	woman’s	orgasmic
responses.
Stoller	 (1973)	 reviews	 the	 whole	 area	 of	 sex
research	and	the	methodological	problems	that	it
involves,	and	these	are	many.	The	concept	of	the
primacy	of	the	penis	has	come	into	doubt.	There	is
no	question	that	male	chauvinism	is	connected	to
Freud’s	enthusiasm	for	the	position	that	men	are
emotionally,	intellectually,	and	morally	superior	to
women	 and	 fitted	 anatomically	 with	 something
superior.	But	Stoller	does	not	feel	that	the	clitoris-
vagina	 transfer	 theory	 is	 refuted	 by	 Masters	 and
Johnson.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
417
The	women’s	liberation	movement	has	served
a	useful	function	in	challenging	some	of	the	basic
early	psychoanalytic	tenets	about	feminine	sexual
development.	 Even	 less	 extreme	 advocates	 have
brought	 under	 serious	 question	 certain	 basic
postulations	 that	 were	 more	 or	 less	 taken	 for
granted	 until	 the	 1960s,	 after	 which,	 under
pressure	 from	 feminists,	 there	 has	 been	 an
increasing	 reassessment	 of	 the	 entire	 subject.
Whether	 or	 not	 motherhood	 is	 at	 the	 center	 of
female	psychology	is	a	clinical	question.	If	it	is	not,
then	the	whole	psychoanalytic	theory	of	feminine
development	 and	 feminine	 psychology	 must	 be
wrong.
Whether	 or	 not	 penis	 envy	 is	 nothing	 but	 a
reassurance	 created	 by	 frightened	 males	 and	 is
only	 symbolic	 of	 realistic	 justified	 envy	 of	 man’s
dominant	social	advantages	is	a	question	that	also
can	be	resolved	clinically.	It	is	possible	to	fudge	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
418
this	issue,	for	example,	by	arguing	that	penis	envy
is	only	one	of	several	constituent	forces	at	work	on
the	girl	that	cause	her	to	turn	to	the	father.	Penis
envy	 is	 probably	 closely	 related	 to	 recent
formulations	on	the	vicissitudes	of	narcissism	(see
ENVY).
If	 it	 is	 true	 that	 anatomical	 and	 biological
differences	 do	 not	 make	 important	 contributions
to	 gender	 personality	 traits,	 then	 the	 whole
analytic	 approach	 to	 female	 psychology	 must	 be
wrong.	 Again,	 this	 is	 a	 sociological	 and	 clinical
issue;	 but	 feminists	 recite	 over	 and	 over	 again
Freud’s	 various	 snide	 and	 demeaning	 comments
about	 women,	 implying	 that	 since	 Freud	 had	 a
prejudice	or	blind	spot	against	women,	the	entire
psychoanalytic	theory	of	the	psychology	of	women
is	 wrong.	 This	 is	 an	 ad	 hominem	 rather	 than	 a
clinical	argument.	Salzman	(1967)	points	out	that
a	 tremendous	 variety	 of	 factors	 goes	 into	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
419
formation	 of	 character,	 and	 the	 concept	 that
anatomy	 is	 destiny	 is	 probably	 too	 simplistic	 a
view	of	character	formation.	There	is	an	absolutely
unsatisfactory	ambience	about	Freud’s	theory,	in
that	 the	 woman	 is	 viewed	 as	 an	 embittered,
castrated	male	rather	than	a	healthy	female	in	her
own	right	(see	also	Schafer	1974).
The	complex	problem	of	gender	role	has	been
studied	 in	 a	 number	 of	 physiologic,	 biochemical,
and	chromosomal	ways	in	recent	years.	Although
the	 whole	 matter	 requires	 review	 and	 restudy,
(Chessick	 1983,	 1984,	 1988)	 there	 is	 no
agreement	 at	 this	 time	 that	 Freud’s	 basic
psychoanalytic	 tenets	 of	 female	 psychology	 have
been	 disproven	 by	 any	 form	 of	 evidence.	 The
entire	
debate	
over	
feminine	
psychology
unfortunately	 has	 been	 very	 muddled	 and
confused	 by	 the	 issue	 of	 who	 is	 for	 or	 against
psychoanalysis	 as	 a	 whole,	 and	 by	 such	 political
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
420
issues	as	women’s	liberation	and	radicalism.
These	arguments	have	a	long	history,	starting
with	the	debate	between	Deutsch,	Lampl-de	Groot,
and	Freud,	on	the	one	side,	and	Horney	and	Jones,
on	the	other	(Fliegel	1973).	Freud’s	later	writing
on	 the	 subject	 began	 with	 his	 paper	 “The
Dissolution	of	the	Oedipus	Complex”	(1924),	and
was	answered	in	a	1924	paper	“On	the	Genesis	of
the	 Castration	 Complex	 in	 Women”	 by	 Horney
(1967).	The	latter’s	basic	contention	was	that	the
girl’s	 oedipal	 attachment	 develops	 out	 of	 her
intrinsic	
femininity	
undergoing	
its	
own
maturational	 process,	 not	 out	 of	 penis	 envy.	 The
notion	 of	 the	 maturation	 of	 intrinsic,	 innate,
internal	femininity	was	not	accepted	by	Freud,	and
in	his	next	paper,	“Some	Psychical	Consequences
of	the	Anatomical	Distinction	between	the	Sexes”
(1925),	 he	 stuck	 to	 his	 original	 concept	 of	 the
importance	of	penis	envy	in	setting	the	little	girl
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
421
off	on	the	pathway	of	the	Oedipus	complex.
Fliegel	(1973)	suggests	that	Horney’s	thesis	of
an	 intrinsic,	 pleasure-oriented	 feminine	 sexuality
that	
undergoes	
its	
own	
vicissitudes	
of
development	 is	 practically	 a	 mirror	 image	 of
Freud’s	(1925)	paper.	Freud’s	paper	also	contains
some	 criticism	 of	 Horney,	 which	 she	 did	 not
accept,	 and	 she	 responded	 in	 1926	 in	 a	 paper
entitled	 “The	 Flight	 from	 Womanhood:	 The
Masculinity	Complex	in	Women	as	Viewed	by	Men
and	 Women”	 (1967),	 a	 frankly	 polemical	 work
that	stresses	the	importance	of	motherhood	envy
in	men.	This	paper,	which	may	be	thought	of	as	the
inception	of	the	women’s	liberation	movement,	led
to	 a	 complete	 separation	 between	 Horney	 and
Freud.	 Unfortunately,	 Freud’s	 (1933)	 final	 words
on	 feminine	 psychology	 also	 contain	 some	 very
disparaging	 antifemale	 remarks,	 and	 his	 paper
“Female	Sexuality”	(1931)	simply	recapitulates	his
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
422
theories	(see	Table	1).
These	
opposing	
views	
carry	
important
theoretical	implications.	The	result	of	Freud’s	view
is	that	since	women	can	never	really	gain	a	penis,
a	woman	never	really	gets	what	she	wants	and	no
amount	 of	 psychotherapeutic	 work	 can	 ever
disguise	
this	
fact.	
In	
this	
sense,	
all
psychotherapeutic	 work	 with	 females	 must	 be
regarded	as	unfinished	and	women	as	unsatisfied
(Freud	 1937).	 In	 contrast	 to	 this,	 Horney	 argues
that	 it	 is	 not	 correct	 that	 penis	 envy	 must	 be
accepted	 with	 resignation	 as	 the	 end	 point	 of
treatment.	Penis	envy,	according	to	Horney,	could
be	 found	 to	 screen	 other	 early	 losses	 and
privations	 or	 deeper	 feminine	 wishes	 and
developmental	 failures	 in	 other	 areas.	 This	 is	 an
extremely	important	clinical	debate.	A	supplement
to	 the	 1976	 (vol.	 24)	 Journal	 of	 the	 American
Psychoanalytic	 Association	 contains	 a	 series	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
423
excellent	 papers	 that	 present	 various	 aspects	 of
this	debate.

FERENCZI,	SANDOR
(1873-1933)
Of	 all	 the	 psychoanalytic	 pioneers,	 Sandor
Ferenczi	perhaps	has	been	the	most	neglected	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
426
most	
misunderstood,	
as	
a	
result	
of	
his
controversial	 quarrels	 with	 Ernest	 Jones.	 His
thought	 and	 work	 is	 currently	 undergoing	 a
significant	 reappraisal,	 and	 Ferenczi	 is	 emerging
as	 a	 very	 important	 pioneer	 in	 the	 area	 of
understanding	
countertransference	
(see
COUNTERTRANSFERENCE)	 and	 in	 investigating
the	 non-interpretive	 aspects	 of	 psychoanalytic
healing.
Ferenczi	
was	
born	
in	
Hungary	
and
encountered	Freud’s	Interpretation	of	Dreams	as	a
physician	specializing	in	psychiatry.	At	the	time	he
read	it,	he	felt	revulsion,	but	there	must	have	been
sufficient	ambivalence	to	motivate	him	to	make	it
a	 point	 to	 meet	 Freud	 in	 Vienna	 in	 1908.	 There
followed	 a	 very	 complex	 relationship	 between
Freud	 and	 Ferenczi	 that	 does	 not	 do	 very	 much
credit	 to	 either	 of	 them.	 There	 has	 not	 yet	 been
sufficient	
release	
of	
the	
Freud-Ferenczi
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
427
correspondence	to	make	any	definitive	judgments
about	that	relationship,	and	it	remains	discussed
at	length	in	the	literature.
Stanton	 (1990)	 describes	 the	 astonishing
confusion	that	began	with	Ferenczi’s	relationship
to	 a	 married	 woman	 named	 Gizella.	 In	 1911
Gizella,	 Ferenczi’s	 lover,	 sent	 her	 daughter	 Elma
for	 analysis	 with	 Ferenczi.	 Ferenczi	 ceased	 to
desire	Gizella	and	began	lusting	for	Elma.	Because
of	this,	Elma	was	then	sent	for	analysis	to	Freud	in
1912.	Freud	advised	Ferenczi	against	marriage	to
Elma	 and	 also	 wrote	 and	 advised	 Gizella.	 In
addition,	 Gizella’s	 other	 daughter,	 Magda,	 later
married	Ferenczi’s	younger	brother.	Elma	went	to
America	 and	 got	 married	 there;	 the	 news	 of	 this
deeply	distressed	Ferenczi,	who	developed	serious
psychosomatic	 complaints.	 Following	 Freud’s
advice,	 he	 proposed	 to	 Gizella,	 with	 Freud	 as	 an
intermediary.	When	they	arrived	at	the	town	hall
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
428
for	 their	 wedding	 ceremony,	 they	 were	 told	 that
Gizella’s	 ex-husband	 had	 just	 died	 of	 a	 heart
attack.
As	 a	 member	 of	 Freud’s	 inner	 circle	 of
practicing	 analysts,	 Ferenczi	 accompanied	 Freud
to	the	United	States	in	1909.	In	1910	he	acted	as
Freud’s	 representative	 at	 the	 founding	 of	 the
International	 Psychoanalytic	 Association.	 He	 also
played	an	important	role	in	the	genesis	of	Freud’s
landmark	 papers	 on	 metapsychology,	 but	 the
tension	between	them	steadily	increased.	To	some
extent,	
this	
was	
because	
of	
the	
strange
“psychoanalysis”	 that	 Ferenczi	 received	 from
Freud,	 which	 actually	 satisfied	 neither	 of	 them,
and	Freud’s	involvement	in	Ferenczi’s	love	life	as
described	above.
From	the	1920s	Ferenczi	began	to	experiment
with	radical	changes	in	psychoanalytic	procedure,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
429
such	as	“mutual	analysis,”	so	eloquently	described
in	his	diary	(Ferenczi	1988).	This	mutual	analysis
technique	 was	 abandoned	 within	 a	 year,	 but
considerable	
differences	
remained	
between
Ferenczi	and	Freud	(Hoffer	1991).
Ferenczi’s	 “active	 technique”	 consisted	 of
heightening	 the	 tension	 by	 making	 demands	 and
prohibitions	on	patients	in	stalemated	analyses,	a
technique	for	which	Ferenczi	is	rather	well	known
and	which	was	described	in	his	monograph	with
Rank	(1986;	see	ACTIVE	TECHNIQUE).
Ferenczi	 renounced	 this	 “active	 technique”	 in
the	mid-1920s	and	went	to	the	opposite	extreme
in	what	he	called	the	“relaxation	technique,”	which
is	less	well	known.	Here	he	attempted,	as	Hoffer
(1991)	points	out,	“to	gratify	the	patient’s	longings
without	 making	 any	 demands”	 (p.	 467),	 because
“he	took	it	upon	himself	to	enrich	psychoanalytic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
430
technique	by	including	the	‘positives’	which	he	felt
Freud	
omitted,	
including	
‘tact’,	
‘empathy’,
elasticity,	 indulgence,	 warmth,	 candour	 and
responsiveness,	in	an	egalitarian	rather	than	in	an
authoritarian	
atmosphere”	
(p.	
467).	
These
attempts	 at	 gratification	 of	 the	 patient	 and
violation	 of	 the	 principle	 of	 abstinence	 (see
ABSTINENCE)	 were	 severely	 criticized	 by	 Freud,
as	 was	 Ferenczi’s	 attempt	 to	 return,	 at	 least
partially,	 to	 Freud’s	 early	 seduction	 theory,	 in
which	 all	 the	 claims	 of	 the	 patient	 of	 being
traumatized	in	childhood	were	essentially	taken	at
face	value	from	the	manifest	content.
Ferenczi	 was	 a	 warm	 and	 loving	 individual
who	 was	 willing	 to	 experiment	 with	 various
changes	in	psychoanalytic	technique.	Vida	(1991)
remarks,	 “Ferenczi	 was	 a	 true	 forebear	 of	 those
who	 have	 sought	 to	 incorporate	 biological,
sociological,	
and	
historical	
data	
into	
the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
431
psychoanalytic	field,	to	represent	more	accurately
a	woman’s	subjective	reality	in	the	theory	of	her
sexuality”	 (p.	 280).	 A	 three-volume	 edition	 of
Ferenczi’s	 papers	 (1950a,b,	 1955)	 has	 been
published	in	an	unsatisfactory	English	translation.
A	 brief	 review	 of	 Ferenczi’s	 work	 by	 Gedo
(1976)	 is	 a	 recommended	 starting	 point	 for	 the
study	 of	 Ferenczi.	 Gedo	 emphasizes	 Ferenczi’s
concept	 of	 the	 “wise	 baby,”	 which	 arose	 out	 of
Ferenczi’s	unusual	opportunities	for	the	study	of
very	 difficult	 cases;	 Ferenczi’s	 fame	 brought	 him
many	 patients	 that	 were	 considered	 too	 difficult
for	 most	 psychoanalysts.	 The	 “wise	 baby”
undergoes	 a	 precocious	 maturity	 in	 order	 to
defend	 against	 helplessness	 and	 the	 fear	 of
abandonment.	
Such	
patients	
may	
undergo
narcissistic	 withdrawal	 or	 assume	 a	 parenting
function	 toward	 their	 parents.	 The	 problem	 of
treating	such	patients	involves	the	capacity	of	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
432
analyst	to	engender	sufficient	trust	in	them	before
they	
dare	
to	
experience	
their	
profound
dependency	in	the	analysis.
Ferenczi	 was	 concerned	 with	 the	 problem	 of
preoedipal	 disorders	 years	 before	 the	 topic
became	 a	 central	 one	 in	 the	 psychoanalytic
literature.	His	manipulations	of	the	patient	in	such
techniques	 as	 “relaxation	 therapy”	 and	 “mutual
analysis”	had	as	a	basic	aim	the	attempt	to	get	at
the	walled	off	core	of	the	patient’s	personality.	In
mutual	 analysis,	 physical	 holding	 did	 take	 place.
Such	 a	 therapy,	 involving	 the	 patients	 being
allowed	 to	 kiss	 Ferenczi	 repeatedly,	 when
reported	to	Freud	led	to	Freud’s	stern	admonition
and	 harmed	 Ferenczi’s	 reputation.	 Ferenczi
himself	
realized	
and	
admitted	
that	
such
techniques	were	not	successful,	and	at	no	time	did
he	 allow	 them	 to	 lead	 to	 overt	 genital	 sexuality.
The	importance	of	his	experiments	today	rests	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
433
the	fact	that	such	techniques	shift	the	focus	of	the
curative	
aspect	
of	
psychoanalysis	
from
interpretation	
to	
the	
transference-
countertransference	
interaction.	
This
“transference-countertransference	
dynamic”
becomes	crucial	(Stanton	1990):
The	analyst,	therefore,	had	to	sense	when	to
“let	 go,”	 and	 how	 to	 work	 with	 the
countertransference	to	promote	the	dynamic
unconscious	 relationship	 through	 which
psychoanalysis	 advanced.	 There	 were	 no
hard	 and	 fast	 rules	 for	 this,	 just	 a	 warning
not	 “to	 overstep	 the	 right	 limits	 in	 cither	 a
positive	or	negative	sense,”	that	is,	not	to	be
too	 “active"	 in	 expression	 of	 either	 love	 or
hate	for	the	patient,	[p.	147]

FIFTY-MINUTE	HOUR
The	
50-minute	
hour	
has	
become	
an
anachronism.	Greenson	(1974),	in	a	classic	article,
called	our	attention	to	what	this	means.	When	the
patient	comes	in	at	the	end	of	a	previous	patient’s
45	 minutes	 and	 says,	 “Doctor,	 the	 couch	 is	 still
warm	 from	 your	 last	 patient,”	 what	 does	 this
“assembly-line”	procedure	do	to	the	ambience	of
the	 treatment?	 Greenson	 claims	 that	 the	 old-
fashioned	50-minute	hour	was	better	for	both	the
therapist	 and	 the	 patient;	 furthermore,	 that	 the
assembly-line	approach	causes	the	patient	to	start
the	hour	without	the	therapist.	This	is	because	the
therapist	 has	 had	 no	 break	 from	 the	 last	 patient
and	is	still	thinking	about	the	previous	session	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
436
the	new	patient	begins	to	talk.
Greenson	 points	 out	 that	 the	 only	 reason	 for
this	 change	 in	 the	 length	 of	 sessions	 is	 money.
Patients	know	this	and	resent	it.	Greenson	argues
that	 analysts	 who	 are	 both	 financially	 and
emotionally	well	off	tend	not	to	use	the	assembly-
line	procedure.	He	sees	it	as	an	act	of	hostility	to
treat	patients	on	such	a	basis,	since	it	degrades	the
patient,	fatigues	the	analyst,	and	kills	the	pleasure
of	the	work.	According	to	Greenson,	back-to-back
sessions	encourage	sadomasochistic	transference-
countertransference	relationships.
There	is	no	question	that	the	45-minute	hour	is
much	 more	 efficient	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 use	 of	 the
therapist’s	
time	
as	
measured	
by	
financial
remuneration.	 My	 sense	 is	 that	 either	 the	 50-
minute	hour	or	two	45-minute	sessions	followed
by	 a	 15-minute	 break	 is	 the	 optimal	 way	 to	 see
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
437
patients.	I	believe	that	Greenson	is	right	and	that
therapists	who	see	patient	after	patient	on	a	45-
minute	
basis	
all	
day	
long	
are	
displaying
unresolved	 narcissistic	 problems	 in	 the	 area	 of
money	 and	 an	 unconscious	 hostility	 to	 their
patients.

FIXATION
Fixation	 is	 evidence	 of	 failure	 to	 progress
satisfactorily	 through	 the	 classical	 phases	 of
libidinal	 development.	 It	 is	 manifested	 by	 the
persistent	 demanding	 of	 archaic	 methods	 of
gratification,	 immature	 ways	 of	 relating	 to	 other
people,	and	the	use	of	primitive	types	of	defenses.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
438
Freud	(1916)	tried	to	use	this	concept	to	explain
perversions,	in	which	he	felt	there	was	a	fixation
at	some	stage	of	psychosexual	development.	Later
he	 believed	 that	 these	 fixations	 were	 very
important	 in	 the	 understanding	 of	 neuroses.	 For
example,	Freud	held	that	fixation	in	the	anal	stage
of	 development	 was	 quite	 important	 in	 the
obsessive-compulsive	disorders.
Freud	 used	 the	 analogy	 of	 an	 army	 under
attack	 that	 had	 to	 retreat	 to	 strong	 points	 to
defend	itself.	This	symbolized	the	individual	who,
overwhelmed	 with	 the	 pressures	 of	 adulthood,
regresses	 to	 the	 fixation	 points	 from	 childhood.
The	
neurotic	
symptoms	
then	
appear,	
and
represent	 the	 conflicts	 involved	 at	 the	 fixation
points	 in	 childhood	 development.	 That	 is	 to	 say,
the	 neurotic	 symptom	 represents	 a	 compromise
formation	 between	 the	 unacceptable	 infantile
wish	stemming	from	the	stage	at	which	the	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
439
is	 fixated	 developmentally,	 the	 inhibition	 of	 that
wish,	and	both	punishment	and	gratification	in	a
disguised	form.	Freud	believed	that	in	the	classical
psychoneuroses	the	unresolved	Oedipus	complex
was	 the	 fixation	 point	 to	 which	 the	 patient
regressed,	
and	
therefore	
the	
symptoms
represented	 the	 expression	 of	 unacceptable
oedipal	 wishes	 in	 the	 compromise	 formation
described	above.
The	more	extreme	examples	of	fixation	occur
when	there	is	actually	a	developmental	arrest	and
the	patient	does	not	progress	at	all	past	the	point
of	fixation.	Patients	who	remain	fixated	at	the	oral
or	anal	stage	were	thought	of	as	having	preoedipal
disorders,	 but	 this	 attitude	 has	 been	 largely
discarded.	It	is	clear	that	even	borderline	patients,
for	 example,	 do	 go	 through	 the	 oedipal	 stage	 on
the	road	to	adulthood.	All	but	the	most	extremely
pathological	patients	have	traversed	the	stages	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
440
psychosexual	
development.	
A	
developmental
arrest	 means	 that	 the	 further	 stages	 are	 grossly
distorted,	
in	
both	
their	
presentation	
and
resolution,	by	derivatives	of	the	fixated	stage.	For
example,	a	patient	who	is	fixated	at	a	stage	of	oral
sadism	 will	 experience	 the	 primal	 scene	 even
during	 the	 oedipal	 period	 in	 terms	 of	 ferocious
cannibalistic	activity.
Freud	 (1905)	 ties	 fixation	 with	 the	 theory	 of
the	libido	and	defines	it	as	causing	the	persistence
of	 anachronistic	 sexual	 traits.	 For	 example,	 in
perversions	the	individual	seeks	particular	kinds
of	 activity	 or	 else	 remains	 attached	 to	 certain
properties	of	an	object	whose	importance	can	be
traced	to	something	in	the	sexual	life	of	his	or	her
childhood.	 This	 also	 implies	 the	 importance	 of
childhood	 trauma,	 which	 was	 paramount	 in
Freud’s	mind	at	the	time.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
441
Freud	was	not	consistent	in	his	use	of	the	term
“fixation.”	 At	 times	 he	 speaks	 of	 fixation	 of	 a
memory	 or	 of	 a	 symptom;	 at	 other	 times	 he
describes	 fixation	 of	 the	 libido	 to	 or	 at	 a	 certain
stage	 or	 type	 of	 object.	 What	 is	 of	 clinical
importance	is	whether	the	given	symptomatology
of	 a	 patient	 shows	 a	 developmental	 arrest	 or	 a
regression	 to	 an	 earlier	 fixation	 point.	 The	 latter
represents	less	psychopathology	and	has	a	better
prognosis	 in	 psychotherapeutic	 work.	 It	 is	 often
very	 difficult	 to	 make	 this	 judgment	 before
considerable	 psychotherapeutic	 work	 has	 taken
place	 because	 the	 presenting	 symptoms	 may	 be
very	dramatic	and	suggest	a	developmental	arrest
by	their	very	intensity;	on	the	other	hand,	initial
dramatic	 presentations	 can	 simply	 constitute	 a
regression.

FORECLOSURE
In	delineating	the	essential	psychopathology	of
neuroses	 and	 psychoses,	 Lacan	 (1977,	 1978)
describes	the	“paternal	metaphor”:	the	father	has
to	 be	 accepted	 by	 the	 mother,	 or	 the	 child	 will
remain	 subjected	 to	 her	 and	 cannot	 fit	 into	 the
symbolic	
order.

father	 and	 the	 child	 is	 critical	 to	 the	 genesis	 of
mental	 illness.	 In	 the	 normal	 state,	 identification
with	the	father	liberates	the	child	and	provides	the
child	 with	 a	 secure	 place	 in	 the	 family	 and	 the
culture.	 If	 foreclosure	 occurs,	 the	 child	 fails	 to
enter	 into	 the	 symbolic	 order.	 The	 person	 so
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
443
constituted	remains	in	nondistinction	between	the
self	and	the	external	world,	dwelling	in	the	realm
of	 the	 imaginary—that	 is,	 psychosis.	 In	 the
neuroses	 there	 is	 a	 disturbed	 relationship
between	the	imaginary	and	the	symbolic	worlds,
so	 that	 speech	 and	 behavior	 become	 deformed,
represented	by	neurotic	symptoms.	In	contrast	to
the	psychotic,	who	lives	in	an	imaginary	world,	the
neurotic	displays	what	Lacan	calls	a	wish	fulfilled
but	mutilated.

FORT-DA	GAME
(GONE-THERE)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
444
Freud	 (1920)	 observed	 his	 18-month-old
grandson	 playing	 a	 game	 in	 which	 the	 little	 boy,
throwing	 a	 spool	 connected	 to	 a	 string	 over	 the
side	of	his	crib,	called	out	“Fort"	(gone).	Then	he
reeled	it	back	by	the	use	of	the	string,	crying	“Da"
(there).	 There	 are	 at	 least	 four	 different
interpretations	 (Chessick	 1992)	 of	 this	 famous
incident.	
For	
Freud	
(1920),	
it	
represents
instinctual	
renunciation,	
allowing	
the	
boy’s
mother	 to	 go	 away	 without	 protest,	 in	 a	 form	 of
mastery,	“beyond	the	pleasure	principle.”	For	R.	D.
Laing,	 it	 is	 an	 attempt	 to	 establish	 ontological
security.	 For	 Kohut,	 it	 represents	 an	 effort	 to
maintain	 control	 over	 a	 self-object,	 which,	 as	 it
works,	 leads	 to	 a	 sense	 of	 cohesion	 of	 the	 self,
triumph,	 and	 joy.	 For	 Lacan,	 it	 is	 an	 example	 of
how	the	child	is	born	into	language.	The	desire	for
the	 mother	 and	 the	 frustration	 of	 this	 desire	 are
expressed	 through	 verbal	 sounds,	 “gone”	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
445
“there.”	 Man	 is	 constituted	 by	 his	 language,	 says
Lacan,	an	idea	borrowed	from	Heidegger.
There	 is	 a	 little	 noticed	 footnote	 in	 Freud’s
(1920)	“Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle”	(p.	15),	in
which	Freud	mentions	the	child	looking	at	itself	in
the	mirror	and	then	under	it	(the	mirror	did	not
reach	 to	 the	 floor),	 thus	 making	 itself	 disappear.
Here	 absence	 and	 presence	 are	 being	 verbalized
(fort-da),	not	just	the	desire	to	control	the	mother.
This	 does	 seem	 related	 to	 Lacan’s	 clever
interpretation.

FRAGMENTATION
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
446
Kohut’s	 self	 psychology	 has	 been	 criticized
(Schwartz	1978)	because	it	lacks	a	clear	definition
of	the	term	“fragmentation.”	The	fragmenting	self
occurs	 when	 the	 patient	 reacts	 to	 narcissistic
disappointments,	 such	 as	 the	 therapist’s	 lack	 of
empathy,	 by	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 sense	 of	 cohesive	 self.
Signs	of	this	are	disheveled	dress,	posture	and	gait
disturbances,	 vague	 anxiety,	 time	 and	 space
disorientation,	and	hypochondriacal	concerns.	In	a
minor	way	this	occurs	in	all	of	us	when	our	self-
esteem	 has	 been	 taxed	 for	 long	 periods	 and	 no
replenishing	 sustenance	 has	 presented	 itself,	 or
after	a	series	of	failures	that	shake	our	self-esteem.
The	 concept	 of	 the	 fragmentation	 of	 the	 self
seems	
to	
be	
equated	
with	
psychotic-like
phenomena,	 at	 which	 time	 reality	 contact,	 even
with	the	therapist,	is	in	danger	of	being	lost.	It	is
characterized	 as	 a	 regressive	 phenomenon,
predominantly	 autoerotic,	 a	 state	 of	 fragmented
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
447
self-nuclei,	in	contrast	to	the	state	of	the	cohesive
self	 (Kohut	 1971).	 Kohut	 (1977)	 emphasizes	 the
signs	of	fragmentation	of	the	self	having	to	do	with
the	 subjective	 feeling	 of	 self-state	 anxiety	 and
what	 Freudians	 would	 call	 signs	 of	 deteriorating
ego	function.
In	 his	 early	 work,	 Kohut	 (1971)	 calls
fragmentation	 of	 the	 self	 “dissolution	 of	 the
narcissistic	 unity	 of	 the	 self’	 (pp.	 120-121)	 and
explains	 how	 it	 is	 often	 accompanied	 by	 frantic
activities	of	various	kinds	in	the	work	and	sexual
areas,	 especially	 in	 an	 effort	 to	 “counteract	 the
subjectively	 painful	 feeling	 of	 self-fragmentation
by	 a	 variety	 of	 forced	 actions,	 ranging	 from
physical	 stimulation	 and	 athletic	 activities	 to
excessive	work	in	…	profession	and	business”	(p.
119).	In	Kohut’s	later	work,	fragmentation	of	the
self	seems	to	be	defined	by	the	experiences	that	it
produces	(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).

FREE	ASSOCIATION
Freud	gradually	developed	a	technique	of	free
association	 between	 1892	 and	 1898.	 Breuer	 and
Freud	(1893-1895),	in	their	work	using	hypnosis,
were	already	attempting	to	encourage	the	patient
to	 give	 voice	 to	 all	 thoughts,	 without	 exception.
One	 of	 their	 patients	 called	 this	 “chimney
sweeping”	(p.	30)	and	actually	taught	Breuer	and
Freud	to	listen	while	she	described	her	thoughts
as	 they	 appeared,	 because	 these	 led	 gradually	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
449
the	 more	 and	 more	 important	 material.	 In	 the
atmosphere	 of	 fiti	 de	 siecle	 Vienna	 it	 was	 very
unusual	 for	 a	 doctor	 to	 listen.	 The	 tradition	 was
that	 the	 doctor	 examined	 the	 patient	 and	 gave
instructions,	and	the	idea	of	listening	at	length	and
being	interested	in	every	thought	that	came	to	a
patient’s	
mind	
was	
a	
radical	
innovation.
Unfortunately,	today	it	has	again	become	unusual
for	doctors	to	listen.
Free	association	is	extremely	difficult	because
we	 are	 all	 socially	 trained	 not	 to	 reveal	 a
substantial	portion	of	our	thoughts.	Some	analysts
have	 quipped	 that	 when	 a	 patient	 can	 free
associate	 properly,	 the	 analysis	 is	 over;	 a	 great
deal	 of	 analytic	 work	 consists	 of	 dealing	 with
resistances	to	free	association.
The	term	“free,”	of	course,	refers	to	the	patient
being	 asked	 to	 suspend	 conscious	 control	 and	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
450
express	verbally	each	thought	and	feeling,	as	well
as	 sensation,	 image,	 and	 memory,	 without
reservation	 as	 it	 spontaneously	 occurs.	 This	 is
sometimes	referred	to	as	the	fundamental	rule	of
psychoanalysis	 and	 requires	 the	 patient	 to
overcome	 the	 usual	 conscious	 embarrassment,
fear,	 shame,	 and	 guilt.	 The	 interventions	 of	 the
analyst’s	interpreting	defenses	hopefully	removes
these	defenses	and	allows	more	material	to	bubble
up	into	the	patient’s	conscious	and	be	expressed
through	free	association.
Free	 association	 is	 an	 ideal	 and	 can	 never
totally	 occur.	 Out	 of	 the	 interaction	 between	 the
patient	 and	 the	 analyst	 a	 certain	 shaping	 of	 the
patient’s	 free	 associations	 inevitably	 takes	 place,
since	a	patient	wishes	to	either	please	or	oppose
the	analyst,	depending	on	the	current	state	of	the
transference.	 This	 presents	 one	 of	 the	 most
difficult	
problems	
in	
the	
verification	
of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
451
psychoanalytic	hypotheses,	because	a	patient	may
tend	 to	 produce	 material	 that	 verifies	 any
hypothesis	 that	 the	 analyst	 may	 put	 forward.	 In
other	 situations,	 the	 analyst	 may	 hear	 only	 that
material	 he	 or	 she	 wishes	 to	 hear	 (see	 EVENLY
SUSPENDED	
ATTENTION).	
The	
problem	
of
selecting	 out	 of	 the	 free	 associations	 what	 is
relevant	 also	 remains	 extremely	 difficult	 and	 is
central	to	the	craft	of	psychoanalytic	listening.
In	 my	 supervisory	 experience	 the	 concept	 of
free	 association	 often	 appears	 to	 be	 abused.	 For
example,	it	makes	no	sense	to	tell	a	patient	who	is
coming	 in	 once	 a	 week	 to	 report	 every	 thought,
feeling,	 and	 sensation	 that	 comes	 to	 mind.	 The
patient	 may	 obediently	 fill	 a	 session	 with	 free
association,	 but	 the	 therapist	 may	 simply	 lose
contact	 with	 where	 the	 patient	 is	 and	 what	 is
going	 on	 in	 his	 or	 her	 life.	 As	 a	 general	 rule	 of
thumb,	 the	 less	 frequently	 a	 patient	 is	 seen,	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
452
more	the	therapy	should	be	problem	oriented	and
the	less	free	association	should	be	employed.	The
novice	is	sometimes	fooled	in	the	other	direction
because	the	patient	may	use	the	request	for	free
association	 to	 fill	 up	 session	 after	 session,	 even
three	or	four	times	a	week,	with	disconnected	and
unintelligible	 gibberish.	 This	 is	 a	 form	 of
resistance	 and	 does	 not	 constitute	 genuine	 free
association.	If	the	associations	seem	to	be	leading
nowhere	at	all,	either	the	analyst	is	not	listening
properly	or	the	patient	is	too	anxious	or	in	a	state
of	
incipient	
fragmentation	
and	
appropriate
interventions	need	to	be	supplied.

(1895-1982)
Anna	 Freud,	 daughter	 of	 Sigmund	 Freud,
produced	seven	volumes	of	collected	works	of	her
own	(A.	Freud	1972).	A	recent	excellent	biography
gives	a	balanced	view	of	her	life	and	work	(Young-
Bruehl	1988).	She	shared	her	father’s	professional
life	 and	 the	 vicissitudes	 of	 the	 psychoanalytic
movement	 in	 the	 years	 between	 the	 world	 wars
and	 afterward.	 With	 the	 Nazi	 occupation	 of
Austria,	 Anna	 Freud	 fled	 with	 her	 father	 to
England,	where	she	founded	the	Hampstead	War
Nurseries	for	children	who	had	suffered	through
bombing,	indiscriminate	evacuation,	and	billeting.
After	 the	 war	 she	 founded	 a	 child	 therapy	 clinic,
the	largest	center	in	the	world	for	the	treatment	of
children	 and	 training	 of	 child	 analysts.	 She	 was
involved	in	a	bitter	controversy	with	followers	of
Melanie	 Klein	 (see	 KLEIN)	 over	 the	 proper
technique	 for	 child	 psychoanalysis	 (King	 and
FREUD,	ANNA
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
454
Steiner	1991).
Anna	 Freud	 became	 a	 living	 legend	 in
psychoanalytic	 circles,	 carrying	 on	 her	 father’s
late-life	focus	in	psychoanalysis	on	the	exploration
of	the	ego.	Her	most	famous	work,	The	Ego	and	the
Mechanisms	 of	 Defense	 (1946),	 constitutes	 a
milestone	 in	 the	 development	 of	 psychoanalytic
psychotherapy.	 It	 elaborates	 in	 detail	 on	 the	 ego
and	 the	 mechanisms	 of	 defense,	 which	 she	 felt
could	 be	 studied	 through	 the	 examination	 of	 the
resistances	
presented	
during	
psychoanalytic
treatment.	
She	
reviewed	
such	
defense
mechanisms	 as	 regression,	 repression,	 reaction-
formation,	
isolation,	
undoing,	
projection,
introjection,	turning	against	the	self,	reversal,	and
sublimation	or	displacement	of	instinctual	aims.
Much	 of	 her	 book	 is	 devoted	 to	 elucidating
hitherto	 poorly	 understood	 and	 rather	 vague
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
455
concepts.	 Preliminary	 stages	 of	 the	 defense
mechanisms	 are	 discussed;	 examples	 given	 are
denial	in	fantasy,	denial	in	word	and	act,	and	ego
restriction	 (see	 EGO).	 Two	 important	 types	 of
defenses	are	investigated	at	length:	identification
with	the	aggressor	(crucial	in	superego	formation)
and	a	form	of	altruism	(the	altruistic	surrender	of
one’s	 own	 instinctual	 impulses	 in	 favor	 of	 other
people).	Finally,	defenses	motivated	by	fear	of	the
strength	of	the	instincts	are	illustrated	by	focusing
on	 the	 phenomena	 of	 puberty,	 in	 which	 a
relatively	 strong	 id	 confronts	 a	 relatively	 weak
ego.
The	 battle	 of	 puberty	 is	 resolved,	 she	 said,
depending	on	the	strength	of	the	id	(which	is	seen
as	a	physiologic	aspect	of	the	individual),	the	ego’s
tolerance	 or	 intolerance	 of	 instincts	 (which
depends	 on	 the	 character	 formed	 by	 the	 latency
period),	and	the	nature	and	efficacy	of	the	defense
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
456
mechanisms	at	the	ego’s	command.	This	last	group
of	 factors	 is	 decisive.	 Certain	 characteristic
adolescent	 defense	 mechanisms	 are	 discussed	 in
detail,	
such	
as	
asceticism,	
intellectuality,
adolescent	object	love,	and	identification.	The	ego
is	seen	as	victorious	when	its	defensive	measures
effectively	 avoid	 anxiety	 and	 transform	 instincts
so	 that	 even	 in	 difficult	 circumstances	 some
gratification	 is	 secured.	 Thus	 a	 harmonious
relation	between	the	id,	superego,	and	outer	world
is	established.
Anna	Freud	begins	her	important	monograph
Difficulties	 in	 the	 Path	 of	 Psychoanalysis	 (1969)
with	Freud’s	suggestion	that	therapeutic	alteration
of	 the	 ego	 must	 be	 accomplished	 by	 the
psychotherapist.	 The	 ego	 distortions	 that	 hinder
analysis	 are	 acquired	 by	 the	 individual	 in	 his	 or
her	
earliest	
defensive	
struggles	
against
unpleasure.	 In	 this	 tract	 the	 importance	 of	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
457
therapeutic	normalization	of	the	ego	is	focused	on,
but	it	is	left	open	as	to	how	and	in	what	way	this
can	be	accomplished.	Anna	Freud	points	out	that
any	 attempt	 to	 carry	 analysis	 from	 the	 verbal	 to
the	preverbal	period	of	development	brings	with	it
practical	 and	 technical	 innovations	 as	 well	 as
theoretical	 implications,	 many	 of	 which	 are
controversial.	There	is	no	doubt	that	this	issue	is
just	as	pertinent	and	controversial	today.

Sigmund	 Freud’s	 theories	 and	 ideas	 are
discussed	 throughout	 this	 dictionary	 under	 a
variety	 of	 headings.	 For	 an	 excellent	 scholarly
biography	and	review	of	Freud’s	life	and	work,	see
Gay	 (1988).	 The	 classic	 work	 by	 Jones	 (1953,

Freiberg,	Moravia.	His	parents	were	Jewish	and	he
was	the	eldest	of	seven	children	from	his	father’s
second	 marriage.	 His	 favorite	 work	 was	 in

physico-chemical	laboratory	of	Ernst	Brücke,	but
he	was	widely	read	in	the	classics	and	was	blessed
with	a	photographic	memory.	He	trained	to	be	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
459
neurologist	 under	 the	 pressure	 of	 having	 to
support	a	wife	and	family.	The	turning	point	of	his
career	was	a	visit	to	Paris,	where	he	attended	the
displays	 of	 the	 famous	 neurologist	 Charcot,	 who
demonstrated	 on	 hypnotized	 hysterical	 patients
the	 power	 of	 suggestion	 in	 symptom	 removal.
Because	 of	 his	 compelling	 need	 to	 be	 famous	 he
(1896)	 rather	 abruptly	 reported	 on	 cases	 of
hysteria	to	the	Vienna	medical	society,	connecting
them	 etiologically	 to	 sexual	 abuse	 in	 childhood
and	claiming	the	same	to	be	always	true	of	cases,
ubiquitous	at	the	time,	of	female	hysteria.	This,	in
addition	 to	 his	 premature	 publications	 about
cocaine,	 caused	 damage	 to	 his	 reputation.	 He
opened	 his	 practice,	 wrote	 a	 book	 on	 cerebral
palsy,	and	began	treating	hysterical	patients.
Despite	his	shortcomings	and	limitations	as	a
man	 of	 his	 Victorian	 culture,	 Freud	 still	 presents
us	 with	 a	 worthwhile	 model.	 He	 was	 capable	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
460
physical	 courage	 and	 amazing	 stoic	 endurance
even	 in	 his	 later	 years	 when	 he	 suffered	 from	 a
painful	 cancer	 of	 the	 oral	 cavity,	 requiring	 many
operations	and	an	irritating	prosthesis.	He	was	a
man	 of	 tremendous	 energy	 who	 combined	 a
boundless	 capacity	 for	 work	 with	 the	 ability	 to
concentrate	 intensely	 on	 one	 goal.	 He	 allied
physical	 courage	 with	 moral	 courage,	 but	 his
conviction	 of	 the	 truth	 of	 his	 theories	 was	 so
complete	
that	
he	
did	
not	
easily	
admit
contradiction.
Freud	
lived	
morally,	
socially,	
and
professionally	according	to	the	highest	standards
of	a	man	and	physician	of	his	time	and	status.	He
was	 a	 person	 of	 scrupulous	 honesty	 and
professional	 dignity.	 He	 kept	 his	 appointments
exactly	and	set	all	his	activities	to	a	timetable.	He
was	 equally	 punctilious	 about	 his	 appearance;
considerable	dignity	and	decorum	were	expected
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
461
of	professional	men	in	his	day,	and	Freud	lived	up
to	 these	 expectations.	 In	 many	 ways	 he	 may	 be
said	 to	 have	 lived	 a	 life	 beyond	 reproach,	 and	 in
his	 genuine	 and	 human	 interest	 in	 patients,	 his
boundless	 capacity	 for	 work,	 and	 his	 passion	 to
discover	the	truth,	Freud	makes	a	very	fine	model
indeed	 for	 anyone	 who	 is	 attempting	 to	 do
psychotherapy.
Freud	 went	 through	 four	 phases	 in	 his	 work:
first,	a	search	for	methodology,	culminating	in	the
method	of	free	association;	second,	a	delving	into
the	 many	 ramifications	 of	 the	 unconscious,	 the
preconscious,	 and	 the	 conscious—that	 is	 to	 say,
the	 workings	 of	 the	 mind	 according	 to	 the
topographical	
theory;	
third,	
an	
unfinished
development	
of	
modern	
structural
metapsychology	and	ego	psychology;	and	finally,	a
preoccupation	with	matters	of	life	and	death	and
the	general	issues	of	sociology,	anthropology,	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
462
philosophy.
As	everybody	knows,	the	founder	of	long-term,
intensive	 psychotherapy	 and	 psychoanalysis	 was
Freud,	 and	 in	 this	 sense	 all	 of	 Freud	 is	 worth
reading	 and	 repeatedly	 rereading	 throughout
one’s	career	for	its	historical	interest	as	well	as	for
the	
innumerable	
clinical	
pearls	
scattered
throughout	 his	 writings	 (Chessick	 1980).	 In	 my
experience,	the	emphasis	on	actually	reading	the
works	of	Freud	in	psychiatric	training	programs	is
diminishing	 at	 an	 accelerated	 pace.	 This	 is
unfortunate,	 not	 only	 for	 the	 loss	 of	 clinical
knowledge	 and	 historical	 perspective	 it	 entails,
but	 also	 for	 the	 loss	 of	 an	 outstanding	 model	 of
scientific	writing.
If	Freud	had	died	before	1897	or	before	the	age
of	40,	he	would	have	achieved	at	most	perhaps	a
page	or	two	in	books	on	the	history	of	psychiatry.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
463
Up	to	then	his	work	on	a	theory	of	the	neuroses
had	 culminated	 in	 “The	 Aetiology	 of	 Hysteria,”
published	 in	 1896.	 His	 basic	 thesis	 was	 that
hysteria	 is	 determined	 by	 traumatic	 sexual
experiences	
in	
childhood,	
the	
unconscious
memory	of	which	reappears	in	a	symbolic	way	in
the	 symptoms	 of	 the	 illness.	 The	 illness,	 in	 turn,
can	 be	 cured	 by	 recalling	 the	 memory	 into
consciousness	 and	 discharging	 the	 associated
affect	 (see	 ABREACTION).	 The	 sexual	 aspects	 of
these	 traumata	 are	 stressed,	 and	 Freud	 claimed
that	 with	 amazing	 frequency	 patients	 had	 been
seduced	by	adults	in	their	immediate	environment
and	 that	 this	 is	 often	 followed	 by	 sexual
experience	 with	 children	 of	 the	 same	 age.
Although	 Freud	 proclaimed	 this	 theory	 to	 be	 a
great	 discovery,	 a	 year	 later	 he	 realized	 he	 had
been	misled	by	patient	fantasies.
Had	 Freud	 died	 at	 this	 point,	 he	 would	 have
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
464
received	 credit	 for	 developing,	 with	 the	 help	 of
Breuer	and	of	his	patient	Emmy	Von	N.,	a	method
of	investigating	hysterical	symptoms	(Breuer	and
Freud	1893-1895).	The	method	of	free	association
replaced	 hypnosis	 in	 Freud’s	 treatment	 of
hysteria,	and	ultimately	became	the	fundamental
rule	of	psychoanalysis	(see	FREE	ASSOCIATION).
In	1897	Freud	at	41	took	one	of	those	rare	and
incredible	turns	in	life	that	might	be	called	a	turn
toward	 genius.	 Perhaps	 the	 discovery	 that	 his
whole	 theory	 of	 hysteria	 was	 based	 on	 a
misleading	conception,	or	the	death	of	his	father	in
1896,	or	a	midlife	crisis	led	Freud	to	begin	his	self-
analysis	through	the	use	of	dreams.
The	 main	 tenets	 of	 depth	 psychology	 are
Freud’s	 dream	 theory	 and	 his	 theory	 of	 errors,
which	 represent	 the	 first	 two	 generalizations	 of
the	pattern	he	had	worked	out	for	hysteria.	These
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
465
theories	 were	 elaborated	 simultaneously	 and
presented	 in	 two	 of	 his	 best-known	 books,	 The
Interpretation	 of	 Dreams	 in	 1900	 and	 the
Psychopathology	 of	 Everyday	 Life	 in	 1901,	 and
were	 followed	 by	 his	 (1905)	 epoch-making
monograph	 on	 sexuality.	 Western	 culture	 has
never	been	the	same.
Freud’s	 creative	 surge	 began	 again	 with	 “On
Narcissism”	 (1914).	 This	 was	 the	 first	 paper
following	 the	 1905	 monograph	 in	 which	 he
modified	 his	 instinct	 theory.	 (Freud’s	 instinct
theory	 actually	 went	 through	 four	 phases	 and
caused	 him	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 difficulty	 and	 heavy
thinking;	see	INSTINCT).	This	and	the	series	of	five
papers	that	followed	it	were	written	essentially	to
present	Freud’s	notion	of	metapsychology.	In	fact,
the	five	papers	were	conceived	of	as	chapters	in	a
book	entitled	Introduction	to	Metapsychology,	and
were	 written	 with	 an	 amazing	 burst	 of	 creative

energy	 in	 six	 weeks	 during	 the	 spring	 of	 1915.
Perhaps	even	more	remarkably,	Freud	wrote	five
more	 essays	 in	 the	 next	 six	 weeks,	 which	 he
subsequently	 destroyed.	 (A	 copy	 of	 one	 of	 these
[Freud	
1987]	
was	
found	
recently	
among
Ferenczi’s	 papers.)	 His	 famous	 papers	 and	 case
histories,	 written	 during	 these	 years,	 remain
mandatory	reading	for	all	psychotherapists.
Despite	the	dreadful	living	conditions	in	post-
World	 War	 I	 Vienna,	 Freud	 in	 his	 sixties
experienced	still	another	creative	surge.	In	Beyond
the	Pleasure	Principle	(1920),	an	attempt	is	made
to	give	metapsychology	its	final	shape.	The	notion
of	 the	 repetition	 compulsion,	 of	 the	 utmost
importance	 to	 psychotherapists,	 is	 emphasized
here.	This	is	the	most	original	clinical	contribution
in	
the	
book.	
From	
it,	
along	
with	
other
considerations,	Freud	derives	his	concepts	of	the
death	instinct	and	primary	masochism,	which	are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
467
still	 very	 controversial	 (see	 DEATH	 INSTINCT).
This	 set	 the	 stage	 for	 a	 basic	 revision	 of	 his
thinking,	known	as	the	structural	theory.
It	is	best	to	begin	study	of	the	structural	theory
phase	 of	 Freud’s	 work	 with	 one	 of	 his	 great
masterpieces,	 The	 Ego	 and	 the	 Id	 (1923),	 which
describes	 the	 “three	 harsh	 masters”	 that	 the	 ego
has	to	deal	with—reality,	the	id,	and	the	superego.
The	 concept	 of	 the	 id	 was	 borrowed	 from
Groddeck	(1923),	and	the	concept	of	the	superego
seems	 closest	 to	 Nietzsche	 (1887)	 in	 The
Genealogy	of	Morals,	but	this	is	a	matter	of	dispute.
Freud	 did	 not	 acknowledge	 a	 debt	 to	 Nietzsche,
although	 he	 did	 acknowledge	 his	 debt	 to
Groddeck.	With	the	publication	of	The	Ego	and	the
Id,	 ego	 psychology	 became	 the	 predominant
interest	 of	 depth	 psychology.	 The	 final	 touches
were	 put	 on	 this	 theory	 in	 1926	 with	 the
publication	 of	 Inhibitions,	 Symptoms,	 and	 Anxiety
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
468
(1926).	This	work,	which	some	have	called	one	of
Freud’s	most	difficult	books,	was	written	partly	as
a	 refutation	 of	 Rank’s	 birth	 trauma	 theory	 and
contains	the	famous	signal	theory	of	anxiety	(see
ANXIETY).	As	a	consequence	of	all	this,	the	focus
in	 longterm,	 intensive	 psychotherapy	 shifted
permanently	 from	 the	 instinctual	 forces	 to	 the
analysis	of	the	ego	(see	EGO	and	FREUD,	ANNA).

FROMM-REICHMANN,	FRIEDA
(1889-1957)
Frieda	 Fromm-Reichmann	 shifted	 attention
from	 the	 understanding	 of	 the	 patient	 to	 the
understanding	
of	
the	
psychotherapist	
in
attempting	 to	 clear	 away	 the	 obstacles	 to
psychoanalytic	 cure	 and	 extend	 the	 theoretical
knowledge	 of	 psychoanalysis	 to	 the	 treatment	 of
schizophrenia.	
Her	
Principles	
of	
Intensive
Psychotherapy	
(1950)	
remains	
one	
of	
the
outstanding	fundamental	texts	on	the	subject,	and
every	other	book	written	on	the	subject	since	that
time	refers	extensively	back	to	this	work.
Fromm-Reichmann	
saw	
psychoanalytic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
471
therapy	 as	 offered	 in	 a	 “spirit	 of	 collaborative
guidance.”	 Basing	 her	 work	 on	 Harry	 Stack
Sullivan’s	writings,	she	conceived	of	treatment	as
aimed	at	the	solution	of	difficulties	in	the	growth,
maturation,	and	independence	of	the	patient.	The
goal	is	to	develop	the	capacity	for	mature	love—a
self-realization	in	which	the	patient	becomes	able
to	use	his	or	her	talents,	skills,	and	powers	to	his
or	 her	 satisfaction	 within	 a	 realistic,	 freely
established	set	of	values.	She	(1959)	warned	us:
The	psychotherapist	is	expected	to	be	stable
and	secure	enough	to	be	constantly	aware	of
and	in	control	of	that	which	he	conveys	to	his
patients	in	words	and	mindful	of	that	which
he	may	convey	in	empathy;	that	his	need	for
operations	 aimed	 at	 his	 own	 security	 and
satisfaction	 should	 not	 interfere	 with	 his
ability	to	listen	consistently	to	patients,	with
full	alertness	to	their	communications	per	se
and,	
if	
possible,	
to	
the	
unworded
implications	
of	
their	
verbalized
communications;	 that	 he	 should	 never	 feel
called	upon	to	be	anything	more	or	less	than
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
472
the	 participant-observer	 of	 the	 emotional
experiences	 which	 are	 conveyed	 to	 him	 by
his	 patients.	 …	 On	 the	 surface,	 these	 rules
seem	 obvious	 and	 easy	 to	 follow;	 yet	 they
are	not.	...	In	actuality,	none	of	us	will	be	able
to	live	up	to	all	of	them.	We	have	to	bear	in
mind	 that	 no	 amount	 of	 inner	 security	 and
self	 respect	 protects	 the	 psychiatrist	 from
being	as	much	a	subject	of	and	vulnerable	to
the	 inevitable	 vicissitudes	 of	 life	 as	 is
everyone	else.	[p.	86]
Fromm-Reichmann	 graduated	 from	 medical
school	in	Prussia	in	1914.	During	World	War	I	she
took	care	of	brain-injured	soldiers	as	a	member	of
the	 staff	 of	 Kurt	 Goldstein.	 Under	 his	 leadership,
she	 gained	 a	 solid	 foundation	 in	 the	 physiology
and	 pathology	 of	 brain	 function	 and	 acquired
insights	
into	
Goldstein’s	
notion	
of	
the
“catastrophic	 reaction”	 of	 brain-injured	 patients
that	 prepared	 her	 for	 an	 understanding	 of
psychotic	 panic	 states.	 During	 the	 1920s	 she
worked	in	a	sanatorium	in	Dresden	and	became	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
473
visiting	physician	at	Kraeplin’s	Psychiatric	Clinic	in
Munich.	Her	discovery	of	Freud’s	writings	led	to	a
turning	 point	 in	 her	 professional	 career.	 She
undertook	 psychoanalytic	 training	 and	 practiced
in	
Heidelberg,	
establishing	
a	
private
psychoanalytic	 sanatorium	 there;	 together	 with
her	 husband	 Erich	 Fromm	 she	 founded	 the
Psychoanalytic	 Training	 Institute	 of	 Southwest
Germany.	Georg	Groddeck,	who	first	proposed	the
term	 “id,”	 became	 an	 important	 influence	 in	 the
group	 of	 Heidelberg	 psychoanalysts	 to	 which
Fromm-Reichmann	 belonged.	 When	 the	 Nazis
overran	 Germany,	 Fromm-Reichmann	 fled	 to
Alsace-Lorraine,	 Palestine,	 and	 finally	 the	 United
States.	 An	 opportunity	 to	 test	 the	 psychoanalytic
treatment	of	functional	psychoses	was	offered	to
her	at	Chestnut	Lodge,	a	sanatorium	in	Rockwell,
Maryland.	There	she	achieved,	in	the	course	of	the
years,	 surprising	 results	 in	 the	 treatment	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
474
psychoses.	At	Chestnut	Lodge,	she	became	a	close
friend	of	Harry	Stack	Sullivan.
Her	work	is	based	on	the	premise	that	there	is
a	 tendency	 toward	 health	 in	 every	 human	 being,
regardless	of	how	seriously	mentally	disturbed	he
or	she	is.	Fromm-Reichmann	was	fully	convinced
of	this	idea	taken	from	Harry	Stack	Sullivan.	In	her
textbook,	in	some	cases	the	patient	is	even	asked
to	 operate	 for	 the	 time	 being	 solely	 on	 the
therapist’s	 belief	 that	 it	 might	 be	 worthwhile	 to
recover.	The	presence	or	lack	of	presence	of	this
inherent	tendency	toward	health	and	the	capacity
of	 the	 psychotic	 ego	 to	 become	 altered	 in
psychotherapy	remain	two	of	the	most	important
and	
controversial	
issues	
facing	
modern
psychoanalytic	psychotherapists.	One	of	the	most
interesting	 facets	 of	 this	 is	 that	 older	 and	 more
experienced	
therapists	
tend	
to	
be	
more
pessimistic	about	the	extent	to	which	the	ego	can
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
475
be	 basically	 altered,	 whereas	 the	 younger	 and
more	 enthusiastic	 therapists	 tend	 to	 be	 more
optimistic	about	how	thoroughly	basic	change	can
take	 place.	 This	 was	 not	 true	 of	 Fromm-
Reichmann,	who	remained	optimistic	to	the	end	of
her	life	and	wrote	beautifully	about	it.
Her	 final	 paper,	 unfinished,	 is	 entitled	 “On
Loneliness”	(1959).	It	stands	apart	from	her	other
productions	 because	 it	 combines	 important
psychoanalytic	 insight	 with	 an	 extraordinary
aesthetic	effect.
Fromm-Reichmann’s	great	contribution	was	to
apply	 the	 principles	 of	 psychoanalysis	 and	 the
findings	 of	 Harry	 Stack	 Sullivan	 to	 the	 clinical
practice	
of	
intensive	
psychotherapy	
with
schizophrenics.	 In	 addition,	 she	 focused	 more
accurately	 on	 the	 meaning	 of	 maturity	 as	 the
capacity	 to	 exchange	 love	 and	 success	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
476
interpersonal	
relationships,	
which	
in
psychoanalytic	 language	 represents	 shifts	 and
alterations	in	basic	ego	functions.	Finally,	she	put
the	 responsibility	 for	 the	 success	 or	 failure	 of
psychotherapy	
more	
heavily	
on	
the
psychotherapist,	 on	 his	 or	 her	 capacity	 to
empathize	and	listen,	which	in	turn	depended	on
the	therapist’s	own	treatment,	innate	abilities,	and
education.

FUSION	OF	HORIZONS
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
477
Gadamer	 (1982)	 attempted	 to	 move	 entirely
away	 from	 a	 natural	 sciences	 approach	 to
understanding	
humans	
to	
a	
hermeneutic
approach.	 He	 suggested	 replacing	 the	 natural
sciences	 approach,	 which	 assumes	 a	 subject
without	 preconceptions	 studying	 a	 text,	 for
example,	the	“objective”	psychoanalytic	authority
studying	a	patient’s	narrative	of	a	dream,	with	an
approach	 realizing	 that	 “understanding”	 always
arises	out	of	our	preconceptions,	our	position	in	a
historical	 tradition.	 To	 understand	 the	 patient’s
narrative	 and	 associations,	 then,	 we	 must	 merge
or	 fuse	 our	 horizons	 with	 the	 patient	 and	 the
patient’s	 society,	 which	 always	 yields	 a	 new
meaning	each	time	there	is	an	encounter	between
a	patient	and	a	doctor,	a	reader	and	a	text,	or	an
historian	
and	
an	
historical	
“fact”	
(see
HERMENEUTICS).
These	
communal	
horizons	
channel	
and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
478
constitute	individual	human	experience.	It	follows,
as	 Gadamer	 explains,	 that	 our	 self-knowledge	 is
not	freely	chosen	but	is	actually	deeply	embedded
in	 culture,	 history,	 and	 our	 bodily	 being,	 aspects
that	 are	 so	 pervasive	 as	 to	 be	 nearly	 invisible.
Gadamer	 writes,	 “History	 does	 not	 belong	 to	 us,
but	 we	 belong	 to	 it.	 Long	 before	 we	 understand
ourselves	through	the	process	of	self-examination,
we	understand	ourselves	in	a	self-evident	way	in
the	 family,	 society	 and	 state	 in	 which	 we	 live.	 …
The	 self	 awareness	 of	 the	 individual	 is	 only	 a
flickering	in	the	closed	circuits	of	historical	life”	(p.
245).
In	Truth	 and	 Method	 (1982),	 his	 major	 work,
Gadamer	 points	 out	 how	 there	 is	 a	 dialectic	 or
mutual	
influence	
between	
the	
subject	
of
interpretation	and	the	interpreter,	in	which,	as	the
horizons	 of	 each	 coparticipate,	 meaning	 is
generated	 in	 that	 particular	 dyadic	 pair	 at	 that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
479
particular	time	and	place.	What	is	known	is	always
known	 by	 a	 knower	 situated	 within	 history	 and
society,	 and	 therefore	 interpretation	 is	 always
conditioned	 and	 influenced	 by	 the	 tradition	 and
the	 horizon	 of	 understanding	 within	 which	 the
individual	 operates.	 Gadamer	 proclaims	 that	 one
should	not	attempt	to	overcome	the	“prejudices”
that	 constitute	 our	 sociohistorical	 vantage	 point,
because	no	technique	and	method	can	ever	secure
absolute	objectivity	in	interpretation.

GELASSENHEIT
(SERENITY,	COMPOSURE)
Bion	 (1967)	 advises	 us	 to	 approach	 each
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
481
session	with	a	patient	without	memory,	desire,	or
understanding.	He	bases	this	on	a	kind	of	faith	that
the	 patient	 will,	 by	 projection,	 place	 into	 us
whatever	important	aspects	of	where	he	or	she	is
at	 a	 given	 time—whatever	 important	 thoughts,
feelings,	 and	 sensations	 are	 in	 the	 patient’s
unconscious	 at	 a	 given	 time.	 We	 are	 not	 to
interfere	 with	 this	 process	 by	 approaching	 the
therapy	 session	 with	 preconceived	 notions,
prejudices,	or	ambitions	as	to	where	the	treatment
ought	to	be	going	(see	REVERIE).
This	 is	 remarkably	 similar	 to	 Heidegger’s
concept	of	Gelassenheit	(Richardson	1974).	In	his
later	 work,	 Heidegger	 believed	 that	 a	 certain
attitude	 of	 mind,	 which	 he	 labeled	 Gelassenheit,
was	needed	to	get	in	touch	with	Being.	This	is	a
kind	 of	 passive-receptive	 attitude,	 in	 great
contrast	to	the	active	scientific-empirical	approach
that	we	use	in	trying	to	understand	and	interpret
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
482
nature	 and	 which	 forms	 the	 assumed	 basis	 of
psychiatric	treatment	today.	Gelassenheit	actually
implies,	 just	 as	 in	 Bion’s	 concept,	 that	 if	 we
approach	 Being	 actively	 with	 a	 scientific	 stance,
we	 will	 be	 blocked	 by	 that	 very	 stance	 from
achieving	enlightenment.
The	importance	of	these	concepts	is	that	they
pose	
an	
alternative	
methodology	
for
psychoanalytic	treatment.	They	also	presuppose	a
certain	 kind	 of	 faith	 that	 the	 vital	 material	 with
which	we	are	trying	to	make	contact	will	be	sent
to	 us	 in	 some	 fashion	 if	 we	 are	 only	 properly
prepared	to	receive	it.	This	borders	on	mysticism
and	has	come	under	considerable	attack;	it	seems
more	 compatible	 to	 the	 Eastern	 mind	 than	 the
Western.	 An	 area	 of	 investigation	 is	 suggested
here	in	which	each	therapist	must	come	to	some
personal	decisions	about	how	he	or	she	is	going	to
approach	a	patient.

GENITAL	STAGE
In	 Three	 Essays	 on	 the	 Theory	 of	 Sexuality,
Freud	(1905)	argued	that	the	genital	organization
is	instituted	at	puberty	and	stands	in	opposition	to
the	 polymorphous	 perversity	 and	 autoerotism	 of
infantile	
sexuality.	
This	
gradually	
became
modified	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 an	 equation	 of
infantile	 and	 adult	 genital	 sexuality,	 with	 the	 so-
called	phallic	stage	of	infantile	genital	organization
initiating	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 (see	 OEDIPUS
COMPLEX).	 Freud	 still	 proclaimed	 that	 the
definitive	 genital	 organization	 took	 place	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
484
puberty,	during	which	the	component	instincts	are
definitively	 fused,	 with	 the	 pleasure	 attached	 to
the	nongenital	erotogenic	zones	becoming	part	of
the	 foreplay.	 To	 maintain	 this	 point	 of	 view,	 the
term	“genital	organization”	should	be	confined	to
the	developmental	phase	of	puberty	and	the	term
“phallic	 phase”	 to	 the	 centering	 of	 sexual
excitement	 on	 the	 genitals	 in	 infantile	 sexual
development.
Moore	 and	 Fine	 (1990)	 give	 an	 excellent
review	of	current	controversy	involving	genitality
and	the	genital	stage.	Briefly,	there	seems	to	be	a
general	 consensus	 that	 too	 much	 emphasis	 has
been	placed	by	practitioners	on	the	importance	of
the	 achievement	 of	 genital	 sexuality	 in	 a
physiological	sense	and	not	enough	on	the	value	of
achieving	 mutual	 orgasms	 with	 a	 love	 partner
with	whom	one	is	able	and	willing	to	share	trust
and	the	vicissitudes	of	life.	This	has	led	to	a	kind	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
485
distortion	 of	 what	 it	 means	 to	 be	 “normal”	 and
probably	has	contributed	to	popular	and	amateur
misunderstandings	 of	 the	 goal	 of	 psychoanalytic
treatment.

GE-STELL
(EN-FRAMING)
This	 concept	 is	 a	 very	 important	 one	 for
psychotherapists.	It	was	introduced	by	Heidegger
(1954)	 to	 describe	 the	 way	 human	 beings	 are
thought	 of	 in	 our	 age	 of	 technology.	 By	 his
idiosyncratic	 use	 of	 the	 German	 word	 Ge-stell,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
486
usually	translated	as	En-Framing,	he	refers	to	the
use	 of	 humans	 as	 one	 uses	 rolling	 stock	 in	 a
railroad	 yard,	 or	 raw	 material,	 which	 may	 be
stacked	 up	 and	 stored	 as	 a	 resource	 that	 is
dispensable	 and	 disposable	 for	 the	 purpose	 of
various	 individuals	 who	 are	 in	 power.	 This
attitude	 toward	 humans,	 which	 automatically
arises	 from	 our	 age	 of	 technology,	 separates
humans	 from	 the	 environment	 and	 views	 the
individual	 as	 just	 another	 object.	 The	 extreme
consequence	of	this	was	the	Holocaust.
The	issue	of	Ge-stell	raises	the	entire	question
of	 what	 is	 the	 best	 attitude	 to	 take	 toward	 the
patient.	 Considerable	 controversy	 has	 been
generated	about	the	therapist-patient	interaction.
Should	this	interaction	be	viewed	as	arising	from	a
dyadic	process,	or	as	primarily	due	to	transference
projections	from	the	patient	as	an	isolated	subject
onto	 the	 relatively	 “neutral”	 therapist?	 These
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
487
disagreements	 in	 the	 psychoanalytic	 literature
contain	
basic	
divergences	
of	
philosophical
premises	 (Chessick	 1980).	 The	 current	 trend	 in
psychiatry	
today	
toward	
more
psychopharmacologic	
treatment	
and	
less
psychotherapy	 is	 an	 excellent	 example	 of	 what
Heidegger	 meant	 by	 En-Framing	 in	 the	 age	 of
technology-

GRANDIOSE	SELF
This	term	gained	prominence	in	the	literature
through	the	work	of	Kohut	(1971,	1977,	1978).	In
response	to	stimuli	from	the	environment	and	due
to	an	epigenetic	preprogramming,	developmental
pathways	 lead	 from	 autoerotism	 to	 primary
narcissism—in	
which	
the	
infant	
blissfully
experiences	 the	 world	 as	 being	 itself—and	 then,
due	
to	
inevitable	
disappointment	
in	
such
narcissistic	 omnipotence,	 to	 the	 formation	 of	 the
grandiose	self	and	the	idealized	parent	imago.	The
grandiose	self	carries	the	conviction	of	being	very
powerful,	 even	 omnipotent,	 with	 a	 demand	 for
mirroring	 confirmation	 by	 the	 selfobject;	 the
idealized	parent	imago	attributes	all	omnipotence
to	 a	 magical	 figure,	 which	 is	 then	 viewed	 as	 a
selfobject	 to	 be	 controlled	 and	 with	 which	 to	 be
fused.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
489
By	
a	
series	
of	
transmuting
microinternalizations	(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY)	in
an	 appropriate	 environment,	 the	 grandiose	 self
becomes	 incorporated	 into	 the	 ego	 or	 self	 as
ambition	(in	Kohut’s	[1977]	“psychology	of	the	self
in	 the	 broad	 sense”	 it	 becomes	 a	 pole	 of	 the
bipolar	 self),	 a	 drive	 or	 push	 that	 can	 be
realistically	 sublimated	 and	 is	 itself	 drive-
channeling	 (Kohut	 1971),	 resulting	 in	 motivated
enthusiastic	 activity.	 The	 idealized	 parent	 imago
becomes	infused	into	the	ego-ideal	(or,	in	the	later
theory,	becomes	the	other	pole	of	the	self),	which
attracts	 the	 individual	 toward	 certain	 goals	 and
performs	 a	 drive-curbing	 function	 (Kohut	 1971).
The	 proper	 integration	 of	 these	 narcissistic
formations	
leads	
ultimately	
by

individual.
If	the	grandiose	self	is	not	integrated	gradually
into	the	realistic	purposes	of	the	ego,	derivatives
of	it	are	disavowed	or	it	is	repressed,	and	persists
unaltered	 in	 archaic	 form;	 the	 individual	 then
consciously	
oscillates	
between	
irrational
overestimation	of	himself	or	herself	and	feelings	of
inferiority	 with	 narcissistic	 mortification	 due	 to
the	thwarting	of	ambition.
An	 important	 controversy	 revolves	 around
whether	
the	
grandiose	
self	
is	
a	
normal
developmental	formation	found	in	all	children	or
whether	 it	 represents	 a	 pathological	 formation.
Kernberg	(1974),	influenced	by	the	work	of	Klein,
regards	 the	 grandiose	 self	 as	 a	 pathological
structure.	 He	 attempts	 to	 describe	 the	 different
qualities	 of	 normal	 infantile	 narcissism	 and
pathological	narcissism,	with	special	emphasis	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
491
the	difference	between	the	grandiosity	of	normal
children	 and	 the	 grandiosity	 expressed	 in
pathologically	 narcissistic	 adult	 patients.	 Kohut
(1984)	 answered	 this	 argument.	 Gedo	 (1977),
although	 he	 offers	 an	 orientation	 different	 from
both	
Kohut	
and	
Kernberg	
(see	
BEYOND
INTERPRETATION),	
also	
disagrees	
with
Kernberg’s	 view	 that	 the	 grandiosity	 primarily
defends	against	rage	and	aggression.

GUILT
It	 is	 extremely	 important	 in	 clinical	 work	 to
have	 some	 distinction	 in	 mind	 between	 “shame”
and	“guilt.”	The	classic	reference	on	this	topic	is	by
Piers	 and	 Singer	 (1953).	 Both	 shame	 and	 guilt
arise	 from	 a	 tension	 between	 the	 ego	 and	 the
superego.	 Shame	 takes	 place	 when	 a	 person	 has
failed	 to	 live	 up	 to	 his	 or	 her	 ego-ideal.	 An
individual	 feels	 guilty	 when	 he	 or	 she	 has
transgressed	 definitive	 prohibitions	 contained	 in
the	superego.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
493
The	 phenomenological	 experiences	 of	 shame
and	 guilt	 are	 somewhat	 different	 and,	 of	 course,
are	 universal.	 Shame	 refers	 more	 to	 a	 kind	 of
narcissistic	mortification	and	produces	the	various
reactions	and	defenses	that	an	individual	uses	to
deal	with	narcissistic	wounding.	Guilt	carries	with
it	more	fear	and	anticipation	of	punishment,	and
thereby	 stirs	 up	 a	 different	 variety	 of	 defensive
functions.
In	 more	 neurotic	 situations	 a	 patient	 may
consciously	or	unconsciously	believe	he	or	she	has
already	 carried	 out	 a	 transgression	 of	 the
superego	prohibitions	(e.g.,	hurt	a	loved	one).	This
often	
produces	
either	
depression	
or
characterologic	 problems	 in	 which	 the	 patient
seeks	pain	and	punishment.	A	great	many	failure
neuroses	 arise	 out	 of	 this.	 The	 character	 type
mentioned	by	Freud	(1916)	as	“those	wrecked	by
success”	 is	 explained	 as	 related	 to	 the	 patient’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
494
unconscious	fantasy	that	success	injures	a	beloved
parent.
Guilt	produces	the	common	clinical	picture	of
self-mortification	and	aggression	against	the	self,
even	to	the	extent	of	self-mutilation	and	suicide.	At
times	 one	 sees	 reaction	 formations,	 as	 in
masochistic	 characters	 or	 individuals	 who	 are
unable	to	compete	and	are	excessively	submissive
and	compliant,	or	a	manic	sort	of	defense	in	which
the	 person	 deliberately	 violates	 and	 injures
everyone.	Some	patients	defend	against	their	guilt
by	making	a	career	of	causing	others	to	feel	guilty.
The	 so-called	 negative	 therapeutic	 reaction	 was
thought	 by	 Freud	 (1923)	 to	 be	 based	 on	 an
unconscious	guilt	that	causes	a	patient	to	need	the
punishment	 of	 suffering	 and	 therefore	 prevents
him	 or	 her	 from	 giving	 up	 the	 illness	 in
psychoanalytic	
treatment	
(see	
NEGATIVE
THERAPEUTIC	REACTION).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
495
None	of	this	should	be	confused	with	Kohut’s
(1978)	 “guilty	 man,”	 set	 off	 in	 the	 psychology	 of
the	self	against	“tragic	man.”	Kohut	distinguishes
“tragic	man,”	the	individual	blocked	in	the	attempt
to	 achieve	 self-realization,	 from	 Freud’s	 “guilty
man,”	the	individual	in	conflict	over	the	pleasure-
seeking	 drives	 and	 struggling	 against	 guilt	 and
anxiety.	Guilty	man	is	a	concept	that	refers	to	the
realm	 of	 parental	 responses	 that	 the	 individual
receives	 as	 a	 child	 to	 single	 parts	 of	 his	 or	 her
body	and	single	bodily	and	mental	functions.	But
Kohut	 points	 out	 that	 there	 is	 another	 realm	 of
parental	 responses,	 “attuned	 to	 his	 beginning
experience	 of	 himself	 as	 a	 larger,	 coherent	 and
enduring	 organization,	 i.e.,	 to	 him	 as	 a	 self’	 (pp.
755-756).	Individuals	with	difficulties	in	this	latter
realm	of	parental	responses	Kohut	labels	as	“tragic
man.”

HERMENEUTICS
Hermeneutics	is	usually	defined	as	the	art	and
science	 of	 interpretation.	 It	 emerged	 in	 the
seventeenth	 century	 as	 a	 discipline	 devoted	 to
establishing	 the	 correct	 interpretation	 of	 biblical
scripture,	 with	 the	 aim	 of	 uncovering	 and
reconstructing	the	message	from	God	that	biblical
scripture	
supposedly	
contains.	
The	
term
“hermeneutics”	 is	 often	 traced	 to	 Hermes	 (in
Greek	mythology,	the	messenger	of	the	gods—and
also	the	god	of	cheats,	thieves,	and	gamblers),	but
the	actual	etymology	of	the	word	is	probably	from
the	 verb	 ερμηνευω	 (hermeneuo),	 which	 refers	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
498
the	 explication	 of	 meaning	 and	 to	 interpretation.
By	the	end	of	the	eighteenth	century	hermeneutics
began	to	be	expanded	to	apply	to	literary	texts	and
historical	 periods.	 The	 German	 philosopher
Wilhelm	
Dilthey	
(1831-1911)	
brought
hermeneutics	 into	 the	 service	 of	 understanding
human	 motivations	 and	 behavior	 and	 attempted
to	introduce	it	as	an	alternative	“method”	to	that
of	the	natural	sciences,	an	idea	first	suggested	by
the	 Italian	 philosopher	 Giambattista	 Vico	 (1668-
1744).
There	 are	 three	 general	 modern	 uses	 of	 the
term	“hermeneutics,”	as	explained	by	Messer	and
colleagues	(1988).	One	of	these	uses,	from	Dilthey,
emphasizes	 hermeneutics	 as	 a	 methodological
alternative	 to	 the	 natural	 sciences,	 an	 art	 or
science	of	interpretation	especially	suitable	to	the
domain	 of	 the	 human	 sciences.	 Unlike	 those
human	 science	 approaches	 that	 attempt	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
499
emulate	 the	 natural	 sciences,	 “methodological
hermeneutics”	does	not	strive	for	“objective	facts”
but	 emphasizes	 meanings	 as	 developed	 by
investigators	 whose	 activities	 are	 inevitably
rooted	 in	 a	 given	 sociohistorical	 setting.	 The
consequence	of	this	approach	is	to	emphasize	the
inseparability	of	fact	and	value,	detail	and	context,
and	 observation	 and	 theory:	 “Methodological
hermeneutics	 utilizes	 qualitative	 description,
analogical	understanding,	and	narrative	modes	of
exposition.	 It	 de-emphasizes	 quantification	 and
controlled	 experimentation,	 and	 does	 not	 seek	 a
neutral	 objective	 vocabulary	 with	 which	 to
characterize	social	phenomena”	(p.	xiv).
Another	 use	 of	 the	 term,	 from	 Heidegger
(1962),	is	labeled	“ontological	hermeneutics”	and
concerns	 itself	 with	 the	 very	 basis	 of	 human
existence.	 This	 aspect	 of	 Heidegger’s	 work	 has
been	developed	by	Gadamer	(1982)	and	rests	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
500
the	premise	that	our	fundamental	mode	of	being
in	 the	 world	 is	 that	 of	 understanding	 and
interpreting;	 there	 is	 no	 knowledge	 free	 of
presuppositions.	
Human	
knowing	
or
understanding	 always	 is	 interpretive	 and	 always
takes	 place	 within	 an	 at	 best	 dimly	 perceived
horizon.	 This	 horizon	 consists,	 depending	 on
which	 author	 one	 reads,	 of	 bodily	 activities,
symbol	
systems,	
cultural	
practices	
and
institutions,	 or	 “superstructure”	 and	 “base.”	 The
consequence	of	ontological	hermeneutics	is	to	call
into	 question	 the	 standard	 Cartesian	 world	 view
separating	 a	 knowing	 subject	 from	 an	 object	 of
study,	 a	 view	 that	 carries	 with	 it	 the	 implication
that	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 have	 a	 neutral	 subject
recording	 in	 an	 unprejudiced	 fashion	 observed
objective	 “facts.”	 This	 view	 is	 the	 fundamental
epistemological	
tenet	
of	
nineteenth-century
natural	science.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
501
A	 third	 usage,	 that	 of	 “critical	 hermeneutics,”
has	 a	 more	 political	 and	 moral	 aim	 in	 that	 it
attempts	 to	 reveal	 the	 ideological	 underpinnings
of	the	culture,	the	intellectual	practices,	the	social
institutions,	and	the	prevalent	economic	system	of
exchange	 itself,	 with	 the	 goal	 of	 fostering
consciousness	of	these	underpinnings.	It	is	hoped
this	 will	 lead	 to	 emancipation	 from	 arbitrary
forms	 of	 political	 domination	 and	 cultural
pressures.	
The	
assumption	
behind	
critical
hermeneutics	 is	 also	 that	 made	 by	 Breuer	 and
Freud	 (1893-1895)	 in	 Studies	 on	 Hysteria:
knowledge	of	one’s	self	will	allow	the	ego	to	make
realistic	 choices	 and,	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the
psychoneuroses,	permit	freedom	from	bondage	to
unconscious	childhood	conflicts.	Habermas	(1971)
applied	this	tenet	of	Freud	to	a	philosophy	of	self-
reflection,	in	the	hope	that	a	useful	critical	theory
and	 practice	 could	 be	 developed	 to	 free	 human
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
502
beings	
from	
blindly	
following	
the	
social
institutions	 into	 which	 they	 are	 thrown	 by	 the
accident	of	their	birth.
The	hope	is	that	hermeneutics	can	function	as
a	corrective	to	what	Heidegger	(1954)	called	the
age	of	technicity	and	to	the	modern	proclivity	to
view	the	natural	sciences	as	models	for	all	forms
of	 inquiry.	 In	 some	 ways	 it	 represents	 a	 revolt
against	 this	 technicity:	 against	 quantification,
objectivism,	 ahistoricism,	 and	 technology,	 which
Heidegger	 claimed	 led	 to	 a	 “darkening	 of	 the
world”	 in	 our	 time.	 To	 put	 it	 another	 way,
Gadamer	 (1982)	 pointed	 out	 that	 to	 have	 a
method	 is	 already	 to	 have	 an	 interpretation.
Hermeneutics	 forces	 psychological	 investigators
to	 confront	 their	 false	 sense	 of	 objectivity	 and
epistemological	privilege.
Methodological	 hermeneutics,	 then,	 attempts
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
503
to	 reform,	 broaden,	 and	 humanize	 the	 social
sciences;	 ontological	 hermeneutics,	 employing
phenomenological	methods,	seeks	truths	that	are
foundational	for	all	inquiry,	including	science;	and
critical	 hermeneutics	 attempts	 in	 particular	 to
reveal	 sources	 of	 domination	 and	 coercion	 by
exposing	
and	
criticizing	
the	
ideological
underpinnings	 of	 all	 social	 practices,	 including
political	and	scientific	activity.
Hermeneutics	 as	 a	 methodology	 begins	 with
the	 work	 of	 Friedrich	 Schleiermacher	 (1768-
1834),	who	proposed	that	a	literary	text	could	not
be	 understood	 unless	 one	 understood	 the
sociocultural	 context	 in	 which	 the	 work	 was
created	and	whatever	factors	in	addition	gave	rise
to	and	made	meaningful	the	author’s	productions.
It	was	also	Schleiermacher	who	first	described	the
“hermeneutic	circle”:	since	understanding	always
involves	reference	to	that	which	is	already	known,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
504
the	 understanding	 must	 operate	 in	 a	 circular,
dialectical	fashion.	A	fact	never	stands	on	its	own,
independent	from	its	context	and	interpreter,	but
is	always	partially	constituted	by	them,	since	it	can
be	evaluated	only	in	relation	to	a	larger	theory	or
argument	 of	 which	 it	 is	 a	 part.	 Therefore,	 we	 go
back	and	forth	between	the	part	and	the	whole	as
we	attempt	to	understand	the	given	“facts.”
From	this	Dilthey	(1978)	attempted	to	develop
a	method	of	understanding	in	human	sciences	that
involved	a	kind	of	empathic	reliving	of	the	culture
or	 historical	 epoch	 that	 produced	 whatever	 was
being	studied.	To	put	it	another	way,	according	to
Dilthey	 a	 radically	 different	 method	 from	 that
utilized	in	the	natural	sciences	was	required,	one
based	 on	 an	 empathic	 identification	 with	 the
subject	under	study	rather	than	on	an	attempt	to
remain	 separate	 and	 “objective,”	 as	 one	 might
watch	 an	 insect	 under	 the	 microscope.	 Although
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
505
Dilthey’s	theories	have	been	much	criticized,	they
still	 present	 a	 timely	 debate	 about	 whether	 the
psychological	study	of	humans	should	be	carried
on	 in	 a	 natural	 sciences	 fashion	 or	 through	 the
method	 of	 hermeneutics	 and	 empathy.	 Authors
disagree,	 some	 stressing	 one	 pole	 and	 some	 the
other,	 and	 some	 trying	 to	 make	 the	 methods
complementary	and	therefore	synergistic—	which
is	 very	 difficult	 to	 do	 because	 their	 premises
contain	a	basic	epistemological	opposition.
For	 Gadamer	 (1982),	 science	 is	 perceived	 as
“method,”	whereas	hermeneutics	is	dialectical	and
rests	 on	 uninterrupted	 listening.	 Gadamer	 hopes
to	 supplement	 science	 through	 the	 use	 of
hermeneutics	in	human	sciences.	This	is	based	on
a	 dissatisfaction	 with	 modern	 “methodology”	 in
the	 natural	 sciences.	 Because	 all	 understanding
contains	prejudices	or	prejudgments,	the	scientific
method	does	not	guarantee	truth.	Especially	in	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
506
human	 sciences,	 the	 knower’s	 own	 being	 is
involved,	 a	 dynamic	 involvement	 between	 the
patient	we	seek	to	understand	and	our	theoretical
preconceptions	 (sec	 FUSION	 OF	 HORIZONS).
“Method”	 does	 not	 lead	 to	 truth;	 according	 to
Gadamer,	 questioning	 and	 hermeneutic	 research
lead	to	a	kind	of	truth.	This	approach	employed	by
Gadamer	 leaves	 us	 in	 an	 unsatisfactory	 position
because	 it	 does	 not	 really	 help	 to	 explain	 how
truth	emerges	in	a	given	historical	situation.	There
is	a	certain	self-contradiction	in	Gadamer’s	work:
How	 does	 one	 know	 when	 the	 truth	 has	 been
found?	What	should	one	do	when	one	has	found
it?	 There	 is	 a	 threat	 of	 relativism	 lurking	 in	 the
hermeneutic	circle.
An	important	aspect	of	the	hermeneutic	stance
is	to	listen	with	wise	Heideggerian	passivity	(see
GELASSENHEIT)	and	to	allow	the	text	or	patient’s
narrative	to	speak	to	us.	What	we	hear	depends	on
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
507
the	 kind	 of	 questions	 we	 ask	 from	 our	 vantage
point	in	history.	It	also	depends	on	our	ability	to
reconstruct	the	problems	that	the	text	or	patient
narrative	 is	 attempting	 to	 communicate	 and	 to
answer.	 The	 present	 is	 only	 understandable
through	 the	 past,	 with	 which	 it	 has	 a	 living
continuity.	 The	 event	 of	 understanding	 comes
when	 our	 horizon	 (see	 HORIZONS)	 of	 historical
meanings	and	assumptions	fuses	with	the	horizon
within	 which	 the	 text	 or	 narrative	 is	 placed.	 At
such	a	moment	we	enter	into	an	alien	world,	but	at
the	 same	 time	 we	 gather	 into	 our	 own	 realm,
reaching	 a	 more	 complete	 understanding	 of
ourselves.	 This	 assumes	 that	 history	 is	 a
continuity	 and	 that	 what	 holds	 us	 apart	 in
understanding	 others	 and	 texts	 from	 the	 past	 is
ideology,	
in	
which	
there	
is	
a	
failure	
of
communication	 between	 the	 cultures,	 or	 the
conflict	 between	 the	 powerful	 ideology	 of	 one
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
508
individual	or	culture	versus	the	powerful	ideology
of	another.
The	 “knowledge”	 that	 arises	 from	 such	 an
investigation	is	not	some	sort	of	immutable	truth
or	 essence,	 but	 is	 context-dependent	 and	 a
function	 of	 the	 “prejudices”	 that	 the	 investigator
brings	to	the	investigation.
By	 assuming	 that	 a	 text	 is	 coherent	 and	 a
narrative	has	a	truth	to	teach	us,	by	adopting,	as
Bion	 later	 also	 advocated,	 a	 certain	 goodwill
toward	 the	 text	 or	 narrative,	 Gadamer	 limits	 the
arbitrariness	of	hermeneutic	understanding.	This
crucial	 stance	 constitutes	 a	 defense	 of	 tradition
even	 though	 tradition	 may	 be	 prejudiced,	 a
standpoint	for	which	Gadamer	has	been	criticized.
To	 a	 certain	 extent	 Gadamer	 advocates	 a
conservative	form	of	hermeneutics,	in	contrast	to
what	Caputo	(1987)	calls	“radical	hermeneutics.”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
509
Bernstein	 (1988)	 points	 out	 that	 it	 is	 not
possible	 “to	 state	 once	 and	 for	 all,	 in	 a	 rigorous,
determinate,	and	nonvacuous	manner,	what	are	or
ought	 to	 be	 the	 standards,	 criteria,	 or	 rules	 by
which	
interpretations	
can	
be	
epistemically
evaluated”	 (p.	 89).	 This	 indeed	 is	 the	 central
complaint	that	is	made	against	those	who	would
envision	 the	 psychoanalytic	 process	 or	 the
dialogue	 in	 any	 dyadic	 interchange	 such	 as
psychotherapy	as	generating	meanings	that	can	be
best	
understood	
by	
the	
procedures	
of
hermeneutics	 rather	 than	 approached	 by	 the
standard	methods	of	natural	science.	In	an	effort
to	 solve	 this	 problem,	 Ricoeur	 (1977,	 1981)
attempts	
to	
validate	
psychoanalytic
interpretations	not	by	the	use	of	the	observational
sciences	 but	 by	 trying	 to	 apply	 certain	 criteria:
that	the	interpretation	must	be	consistent	with	the
basic	 tenets	 of	 Freudian	 theory,	 must	 satisfy
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
510
psychoanalytic	
rules	
for	
understanding	
the
unconscious,	
must	
be	
“mutative”	
or
therapeutically	 effective,	 and	 must	 be	 part	 of	 an
intelligible	 narrative	 and	 not	 inconsistent	 with
other	aspects	of	the	narrative.
Hermeneutics	 has	 been	 attacked	 from	 one
direction	by	such	natural	scientists	and	empirical
philosophers	 as	 Grünbaum	 (1984),	 and	 from
another	 direction	 by	 authors	 like	 Spence	 (1982),
who	 have	 emphasized	 the	 relativism	 that	 it	 can
easily	become.	In	addition,	there	is	a	tendency	on
the	 part	 of	 hermeneuticists	 to	 write	 in	 a	 very
difficult	fashion,	using	a	convoluted	prose	that	is
very	 unfamiliar	 to	 U.S.	 readers.	 In	 our	 pragmatic
country	we	are	used	to	and	expect	clear	and	lucid
exposition,	 and	 we	 tend	 to	 react	 negatively	 to
jargonistic	and	continental	terminology,	especially
when	it	is	not	clearly	defined.	The	existence	of	a
whole	variety	of	hermeneutic	approaches	further
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
511
complicates	 the	 issue	 and	 often	 leads	 to	 a	 total
rejection	 of	 the	 field	 by	 the	 impatient	 student	 of
the	topic.	This	is	a	mistake.	For	example,	one	of	the
finest	 works	 combining	 hermeneutics	 and	 the
natural	 science	 approach	 is	 to	 be	 found	 in
Ricoeur’s	 (1970)	 Freud	 and	 Philosophy,	 a	 very
difficult	book	to	read	(see	Chessick	1988),	which,
although	it	stresses	the	centrality	of	hermeneutics
and	 interpretation	 in	 psychoanalysis,	 leaves	 the
door	open	for	the	empirical	study	of	what	Ricoeur
believes	to	be	Freud’s	combination	of	praxis	with
interpretation.
Diagnoses	and	formulations	in	the	practice	of
psychotherapy,	 if	 the	 hermeneutic	 approach	 is
employed,	 cannot	 be	 viewed	 as	 disease	 entities
and	 natural	 science	 “facts,”	 but	 rather	 as
temporary	formations	that	change	with	the	times,
historical	eras,	cultures,	and	prevailing	prejudices
and	 practices.	 The	 problem	 of	 a	 hermeneutic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
512
psychiatry	would	be	to	steer	between	the	Scylla	of
naive	realism,	ignoring	the	major	participation	of
the	 culture	 and	 the	 psychotherapist,	 and	 the
Charybdis	 of	 relativism,	 nihilism,	 and	 hopeless
skepticism.	 Much	 work	 remains	 to	 be	 done	 to
clarify	 the	 role	 and	 limitations	 of	 hermeneutics
and	 to	 incorporate	 it	 into	 the	 clinical	 practice	 of
psychotherapy,	 and	 this	 work	 must	 be	 done
against	 the	 prevailing	 ideology	 of	 scientific
materialism	that	characterizes	our	historical	era.	A
hermeneutic	psychiatry	offers	us	the	best	hope	of
not	 losing	 sight	 of	 the	 methodological	 horizons
that	 delimit	 our	 clinical	 work,	 and	 of	 widening
these	 horizons	 to	 provide	 further	 understanding
of	our	patients.

HOLDING	ENVIRONMENT
The	technique	of	providing	an	experience	or	an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
515
atmosphere	 for	 a	 patient	 in	 psychotherapy,
sometimes	depicted	as	“good-enough	holding”	to
emphasize	the	parallel	to	the	facilitating	mother-
infant	 dyad,	 has	 been	 described	 by	 Winnicott
(1958).	 A	 summary	 of	 what	 Winnicott	 (pp.	 285-
286)	 says	 the	 therapist	 has	 to	 provide	 is	 as
follows:
1.	A	consistent	and	frequent	being	at	the	service
of	 the	 patient,	 at	 a	 time	 arranged	 to	 suit
mutual	convenience.
2.	Being	reliably	there,	usually	on	time.
3.	For	the	contracted-for	period,	keeping	awake
and	being	professionally	preoccupied	with
the	
patient	
and	
nothing	
else	
(e.g.,
telephone	
calls,	
note	
taking,	
tape
recorders).
4.	 The	 expression	 of	 “love”	 in	 the	 positive
interest	 taken	 and	 “hate”	 (as	 Winnicott
calls	it)	in	the	strict	start	and	finish	and	in
the	matter	of	fees.
5.	 The	 sincere	 and	 dedicated	 attempt	 to	 get	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
516
touch	with	the	psychodynamic	process	of
the	 patient,	 to	 understand	 the	 material
presented,	and	eventually	to	communicate
this	understanding	by	properly	timed	and
formulated	interpretations.
6.	
A	
nonanxious	
approach	
of	
objective
observation	 and	 scientific	 study,	 with	 a
concomitant	sense	of	physicianly	vocation.
7.	 Work	 done	 in	 a	 room	 that	 is	 quiet	 and	 not
liable	to	sudden	unpredictable	sounds	and
yet	 not	 dead	 quiet;	 proper	 lighting	 of	 a
room,	not	a	light	staring	in	the	face	and	not
a	variable	light.
8.	 Keeping	 out	 of	 the	 relationship	 both	 moral
judgment	 and	 any	 introduction	 of	 details
of	the	therapist’s	personal	life	and	ideas.
9.	Avoiding	temper	tantrums,	compulsive	falling
in	 love,	 and	 so	 on,	 and	 in	 general	 being
neither	
hostile	
and	
retaliatory	
nor
exploitative	toward	the	patient.
10.	 Maintaining	 a	 consistent,	 clear	 distinction
between	 fact	 and	 fantasy,	 so	 that	 the
therapist	 is	 not	 hurt	 or	 offended	 by	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
517
aggressive	 dream	 or	 fantasy;	 in	 general,
eliminating	 any	 “talion	 reaction”	 and
ensuring	 that	 both	 the	 therapist	 and	 the
patient	
consistently	
survive	
the
interaction.
In	 my	 supervisory	 experience,	 these	 basic
precepts	 are	 often	 violated.	 Some	 of	 the	 raging
reactions	 we	 see	 from	 patients	 who	 are	 labeled
borderline	 are	 actually	 a	 response	 to	 the	 sensed
empathic	 failure	 of	 the	 therapist	 when	 a	 good-
enough	holding	environment	is	not	provided	(see
BORDERLINE).	 Providing	 a	 good-enough	 holding
environment	is	especially	difficult	in	public	mental
health	
facilities,	
where	
there	
are	
many
interruptions	and,	most	unfortunately,	insufficient
privacy	 in	 the	 rooms	 used	 for	 therapy.	 One
wonders	whether	anyone	would	dare	to	carry	on
surgery	under	such	suboptimal	conditions	unless
it	were	in	a	battlefield	situation,	but	it	is	the	rule
rather	than	the	exception	in	crowded	public	clinics
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
518
for	 these	 suboptimal	 conditions	 to	 prevail.
Somehow	 the	 patient	 and	 the	 therapist	 are
supposed	to	ignore	the	effect	of	these	violations	on
the	relationship,	the	therapeutic	alliance,	and	the
production	 of	 the	 patient’s	 material.	 This	 is	 a
social	 problem	 that,	 to	 a	 great	 extent,	 has	 been
simply	ignored.	It	also	exerts	a	subtle	pressure	on
the	
psychiatrist	
to	
rely	
more	
on
psychopharmacologic	
agents	
than	
on
psychotherapeutic	 listening	 and	 interpretation
under	such	conditions	(see	GE-STELL).

HOMOSEXUALITY
(see	also	PSEUDO-HOMOSEXUALITY)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
519
The	 discussion	 of	 homosexuality	 has	 always
been	and	continues	to	be	unfortunately	mired	in
social	 issues.	 Samuel	 Johnson	 does	 not	 mention
the	 subject	 in	 his	 dictionary.	 Clearly,	 the
persecution	 of	 any	 group	 of	 individuals	 on	 the
basis	of	the	fact	that	they	differ	from	the	average	is
simply	 the	 acting	 out	 of	 hostile	 and	 violent
impulses	 in	 a	 socially	 acceptable	 milieu	 and	 is
never	to	be	condoned.	An	important	factor	leading
to	 the	 persecution	 of	 homosexuals	 is	 repressed
homosexuality	 in	 the	 persecutors;	 thus	 in	 many
instances	 the	 hatred	 of	 homosexuals,	 known	 as
homophobia,	
has	
the	
same	
dynamics	
as
homosexual	panic	(see	HOMOSEXUAL	PANIC).	The
actual	 killing	 of	 homosexuals	 is	 parallel	 to	 the
violence	 and	 assault	 that	 takes	 place	 when	 an
individual	undergoes	a	homosexual	panic,	but	the
persecution	 of	 homosexuals	 has	 a	 wider	 basis
because	 every	 society	 always	 seems	 to	 need	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
520
“enemy,”	 whether	 blacks,	 Jews,	 homosexuals,	 or
Communists	(see	DEATH	INSTINCT).
The	 term	 “homosexual”	 simply	 refers	 to
mentation	or	behavior	in	which	the	object	of	the
individual’s	sexual	desire	is	a	person	of	the	same
sex.	 The	 cause	 of	 this,	 when	 it	 appears,	 is	 hotly
disputed.	It	is	well	known	that	in	situations	where
persons	of	the	opposite	sex	are	unavailable,	such
as	 in	 prisons,	 homosexuality	 flourishes.	 It	 is	 also
well	known	that	certain	societies,	such	as	ancient
Greece,	condoned	homosexuality	as	a	normal	form
of	
behavior,	
especially	
between	
men	
and
pubescent	boys.	Most	Western	societies	have	been
extremely	 prejudiced	 against	 homosexuality,	 and
it	is	only	recently	that	the	demand	for	equal	rights
by	homosexuals	has	become	even	tolerable	to	the
heterosexual	culture.
Freud	 (1914)	 distinguished	 between	 anaclitic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
521
and	 narcissistic	 choices	 of	 love	 objects.	 The
anaclitic	object	choice	attempts	to	bring	back	the
lost	 mother	 and	 precedes	 developmentally	 the
narcissistic	 object	 choice.	 The	 latter	 is	 a	 form	 of
secondary	narcissism	in	which	the	person	chosen
to	love	resembles	one’s	own	self.	In	certain	forms
of	homosexuality	the	object	chosen	is	the	child-self
who	 is	 then	 treated	 the	 way	 the	 homosexual
wishes	 his	 mother	 to	 treat	 him.	 Some	 forms
represent	a	type	of	secondary	narcissism	in	which
the	person	loves	what	he	himself	is	or	was,	what
he	would	like	to	be,	or	someone	once	thought	of	as
a	part	of	himself	(see	NARCISSISM).
In	both	males	and	females	homosexuality	may
be	active,	in	which	the	subject	behaves	as	a	man
and	 treats	 his	 or	 her	 object	 as	 though	 he	 or	 she
were	 a	 female,	 or	 passive,	 in	 which	 the	 subject
behaves	as	a	woman	and	treats	his	or	her	object	as
a	man.	It	may	be	manifest,	latent,	aim-inhibited,	or
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
522
sublimated.	The	whole	question	of	whether	such	a
concept	as	latent	homosexuality	refers	to	anything
remains	 in	 dispute,	 since	 it	 connotes	 a	 certain
passivity	 or	 submissive	 behavior	 toward	 more
powerful	 males	 (or	 females	 in	 the	 case	 of	 latent
female	homosexuality)	rather	than	necessarily	to
specifically	repressed	homosexual	feelings.	It	has
degenerated	 to	 a	 certain	 extent	 into	 a	 pejorative
term	and	is	best	avoided.
Although	Freud	suggested	in	various	writings
that	
fear	
of	
castration,	
excessive	
oedipal
attachment	 to	 the	 mother,	 narcissistic	 object
choice,	
and	
repressed	
sibling	
rivalry	
with
overcompensatory	 love	 for	 the	 rival	 were
important	etiologic	factors	in	male	homosexuality,
there	 is	 much	 argument	 as	 to	 whether	 these
concepts	have	ever	been	of	value	in	the	treatment
of	 homosexuals,	 especially	 homosexuals	 who	 are
satisfied	 with	 their	 orientation.	 The	 question	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
523
whether	
homosexuality	
has	
a	
genetic	
or
constitutional	 basis	 remains	 open;	 studies	 of	 the
subject	so	far	have	not	been	well	designed.	There
are	 no	 acceptable	 general	 formulations	 about
developmental	 events	 that	 may	 propel	 an
individual	toward	homosexual	object	choice,	such
as	 faulty	 parenting	 or	 parental	 or	 sibling
seduction,	 although	 in	 individual	 cases	 these
factors	may	be	prominent.
Freud	 (1905)	 divided	 homosexuals	 into
absolute,	amphigenic,	and	contingent.	An	absolute
homosexual	is	aroused	exclusively	by	a	member	of
his	 or	 her	 own	 sex	 and	 is	 indifferent	 or	 even
hostile	 to	 the	 opposite	 sex.	 Amphigenic	 subjects
engage	 in	 sexual	 relations	 with	 both	 sexes;	 this
term	 today	 is	 usually	 replaced	 with	 the	 term
“bisexual.”	 This	 is	 unfortunate,	 because	 Freud
correctly	 postulated	 that	 there	 was	 a	 bisexual
potential	 in	 all	 humans,	 but	 the	 amphigenic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
524
homosexual	carries	this	out,	whereas	the	average
individual	 under	 normal	 conditions	 does	 not.
Contingent	homosexuals	are	individuals	capable	of
accepting	homosexual	gratification	when	persons
of	 the	 opposite	 sex	 are	 unavailable,	 as	 in	 prison
situations.	There	are	also	individuals	whose	sexual
orientation	 is	 heterosexual	 but	 who	 occasionally
take	 part	 in	 homosexual	 activity.	 In	 my	 clinical
experience	
there	
are	
individuals	
whose
homosexual	 activity	 is	 confined	 to	 what	 would
ordinarily	be	called	foreplay,	such	as	stroking	and
caressing	or	occasional	mutual	masturbation,	but
who	 at	 the	 same	 time	 carry	 on	 active	 genital
heterosexual	 activity.	 It	 follows	 that	 there	 is	 an
endless	variety	of	permutations	and	combinations
of	heterosexual	and	homosexual	behavior,	and	it	is
well	
known	
that	
these	
permutations	
and
combinations	 can	 change	 over	 the	 life	 of	 an
individual	 from	 adolescence	 to	 old	 age.	 These
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
525
classifications	 are	 therefore	 strictly	 descriptive
and	
indicate	
nothing	
about	
etiology	
or
psychodynamics.
The	 fact	 of	 such	 a	 variety	 implies	 that
developmental	
and	
environmental	
factors,
regardless	 of	 constitutional	 and	 genetic	 factors,
play	 a	 major	 role	 in	 the	 individual’s	 specific
activities	and	object	choices,	and	difficulties	in	the
preoedipal	 or	 oedipal	 stages	 influence	 the
situation	 in	 an	 important	 fashion.	 Clinical	 work
certainly	 indicates	 that	 many	 male	 homosexual
individuals	 have	 not	 satisfactorily	 traversed	 the
oedipal	 phase	 and	 are	 often	 deeply	 attached	 to
their	 mother,	 which	 makes	 it	 very	 difficult	 for
them	to	transfer	their	attachment	to	other	women
without	suffering	from	incestuous	fantasies.	They
solve	 this	 by	 changing	 their	 orientation	 from
women	
to	
men.	
Fear	
of	
castration	
often
contributes	to	a	negative	oedipal	resolution,	with
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
526
the	 acting	 out	 in	 homosexual	 behavior	 of
regression	to	oral	and	anal	levels.	The	homosexual
outcome	 of	 a	 negative	 resolution	 of	 the	 Oedipus
complex,	 however,	 is	 related	 to	 unresolved
preoedipal	 issues	 with	 the	 mother.	 But	 these
findings	 are	 gathered	 from	 the	 treatment	 of
homosexual	 patients	 who	 are	 not	 satisfied	 with
and	often	wish	to	change	their	orientation.	Much
less	is	known	about	patients	who	are	comfortable
with	their	homosexual	orientation,	and	there	is	no
evidence	that	such	patients	are	in	any	other	areas
of	 life	 more	 pathological	 than	 the	 average
heterosexual	 individual.	 It	 should	 be	 noted	 that
this	was	already	recognized	by	Freud	in	1905.
From	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 therapist,	 it	 is
clear	that	each	patient	must	be	judged	on	the	basis
of	
his	
or	
her	
individual	
and	
unique
psychodynamics	and	family	constellation.	Patients
who	 are	 satisfied	 with	 their	 sexual	 orientation
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
527
should	 not	 be	 approached	 with	 the	 idea	 that
because	of	some	theoretical	norm	it	is	the	duty	of
the	therapist	to	change	them;	it	is	much	better	in
psychotherapy	 to	 approach	 patients	 in	 the	 areas
where	they	themselves	feel	they	need	help	rather
than	 to	 impose	 on	 the	 patients	 additional	 tasks
that	the	patients	did	not	bring	into	the	treatment.
Therapists	
who	
have	
prejudices	
against
homosexuals	 should	 clearly	 not	 work	 with	 such
patients	and	should	refer	them	elsewhere.	In	my
opinion,	 however,	 there	 is	 no	 evidence	 that
homosexuals	 should	 be	 treated	 exclusively	 by
homosexual	 therapists,	 any	 more	 than	 blacks
should	 be	 treated	 by	 black	 therapists,	 Jews	 by
Jewish	therapists,	and	so	forth.	It	is	the	individual
personality	of	the	therapist	or	psychoanalyst	that
counts	the	most,	not	these	more	or	less	superficial
features.
There	 is	 even	 less	 understanding	 of	 female
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
528
homosexuality,	 or	 lesbianism.	 In	 addition	 to	 the
dynamics	described	above,	the	female	homosexual
partner	is	sometimes	thought	of	as	providing	the
mothering	that	the	patient	did	not	receive,	or	the
homosexual	 activity	 becomes	 the	 acting	 out	 of	 a
blissful	 symbiotic	 relationship	 that	 attempts	 to
deny	 the	 oedipal	 conflict.	 The	 latter	 dynamic
involves	not	the	replacement	of	the	mother	for	the
purposes	of	substituting	for	what	was	not	received
but	 rather	 a	 denial	 that	 the	 daughter	 hates	 the
mother	in	the	oedipal	situation	and	an	acting	out
of	 the	 defensive	 fantasy	 of	 a	 blissful	 symbiosis
with	the	mother.
In	 my	 clinical	 experience	 the	 father	 has	 an
important	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of
homosexuality.	 Often	 the	 father	 of	 the	 male
homosexual	 is	 a	 rather	 passive	 or	 remote	 figure
who	presents	a	very	poor	idealization	prospect.	In
the	language	of	self	psychology,	for	example,	there
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
529
is	
an	
early	
and	
phase-inappropriate
disappointment	 in	 idealization	 of	 the	 father,	 and
the	 homosexuality	 represents	 a	 search	 for	 an
appropriate	 male	 idealization	 figure.	 In	 the
development	of	female	homosexuality	there	is	not
only	the	conscious	or	unconscious	encouragement
of	 dependency	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 mother	 or	 the
mother’s	depreciation	of	the	girl’s	body,	but	also	a
father	who	shows	contempt	and	criticism	toward
men	and/or	toward	the	girl	and	her	body,	which
may	 lead	 the	 girl	 away	 from	 heterosexual
interests.	There	are	many	difficulties	in	living	that
may	 precipitate	 the	 appearance	 of	 homosexual
behavior	 in	 women,	 such	 as	 disappointing	 love
experiences	
or	
stress	
situations	
that	
are
intolerable,	which	in	turn	precipitate	a	regression
to	 the	 yearning	 for	 a	 symbiosis	 with	 the
preoedipal	 mother.	 All	 of	 this	 remains	 for
exploration	and	is	of	great	clinical	importance.

HOMOSEXUAL	PANIC
An	 attack	 of	 severe	 anxiety	 based	 on	 the
stirring	 up	 of	 unconscious	 conflicts	 involving
homosexuality	was	labeled	in	previous	literature
as	 homosexual	 panic,	 a	 term	 that	 is	 not	 used	 as
much	as	it	should	be	today.	The	importance	of	this
concept	lies	in	the	fact	that	a	significant	number	of
physical	assaults	on	psychiatrists	are	the	result	of
homosexual	panic.	Sometimes	this	is	precipitated
by	 a	 male	 psychiatrist	 attempting	 to	 interview	 a
male	patient	in	a	very	small	room	or	attempting	to
do	 a	 physical	 examination	 on	 such	 a	 patient	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
531
isolated	 conditions.	 What	 happens	 in	 these
circumstances	 is	 that	 the	 patient’s	 unconscious
homosexual	urges	are	stirred	up	by	the	situation
or	 by	 the	 behavior	 of	 the	 therapist,	 and	 this
produces	unbearable	anxiety	in	the	patient.	In	the
worst	case	scenario,	the	patient	may	deal	with	the
unacceptable	 homoerotic	 urges	 by	 the	 dynamics
described	by	Freud	(1911)	in	the	case	of	Schreber.
Briefly,	the	patient	unconsciously	thinks,	“1	do	not
love	him,	I	hate	him,	because	he	persecutes	me.”
The	result	of	this	is	to	destroy	and	eliminate	the
persecutor,	 which	 in	 turn	 removes	 the	 patient’s
source	of	anxiety.
It	follows	that	when	the	therapist	is	confronted
with	 growing	 anxiety	 in	 a	 patient,	 one	 of	 the
considerations	ought	to	be	whether	the	therapist
is	 utilizing	 an	 environment	 or	 engaging	 in
behavior	 that	 might	 be	 stirring	 up	 homosexual
anxiety.	It	is	the	mark	of	the	amateur	to	ignore	this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
532
until	the	patient	explodes.
According	to	Campbell	(1989),	Kempf	in	1920
described	this	situation,	which	became	known	as
Kempf's	 disease.	 Besides	 physical	 violence,	 the
patient	may	display	delusions,	hallucinations,	and
depression,	 and	 may	 even	 commit	 suicide.
Homosexual	panics	can	be	precipitated	by	the	loss
of	a	member	of	the	same	sex	to	whom	the	subject
is	 emotionally	 attached,	 or	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 other
conditions	that	reduce	the	capacity	of	the	ego	to
hold	 unacceptable	 desires	 in	 repression,	 such	 as
fatigue	or	illness.	Sometimes	it	is	precipitated	by
failures	in	heterosexual	courting	or	performance,
and	 traditionally	 it	 was	 described	 as	 often
heralding	 the	 onset	 of	 schizophrenia.	 It	 is	 more
frequent	in	males	than	in	females	but	may	be	seen
in	both	sexes,	especially	these	days	when	there	is
such	a	blurring	of	social	roles	and	gender	identity.

HORIZONS
According	 to	 Heidegger	 (1962),	 human	 being
always	 involves	 a	 context	 or	 cultural	 totality
within	 which	 experience	 occurs	 that	 is	 labeled,
alternatively,	 “ground,”	 “horizon,”	 or	 “clearing.”
This	 horizon	 is	 the	 essential	 concept	 of	 modern
hermeneutics	 (see	 HERMENEUTICS)	 because	 it
undercuts	the	Cartesian	opposition	of	subject	and
object	 and	 is	 the	 very	 condition	 or	 possibility	 of
anything	 at	 all	 appearing	 or	 being	 known.
According	to	Heidegger,	the	horizon	involves	the
customs,	 institutions,	 and	 language	 of	 a	 given
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
534
culture,	 not	 the	 idiosyncratic	 perspectives	 of
isolated	individuals.
Gadamer	(1982)	attempted	to	move	away	from
a	 natural	 sciences	 approach	 to	 understanding
humans	 by	 the	 use	 of	 hermeneutic	 theory,	 an
approach	realizing	that	“understanding”	arises	out
of	 our	 preconceptions,	 our	 position	 in	 historical
tradition.	 To	 understand	 the	 patient’s	 narrative
and	 associations,	 we	 must	 merge	 or	 fuse	 our
horizons	with	the	patient	and	his	or	her	culture	or
society	(see	FUSION	OF	HORIZONS).
These	
communal	
horizons	
channel	
and
constitute	individual	human	experience.	It	follows,
as	 Gadamer	 explains,	 that	 our	 self-knowledge	 is
not	freely	chosen	but	actually	deeply	imbedded	in
our	culture,	history,	and	bodily	being,	aspects	that
are	so	pervasive	as	to	be	nearly	invisible.	Gadamer
(1982)	writes,	“History	does	not	belong	to	us,	but
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
535
we	 belong	 to	 it.	 Long	 before	 we	 understand
ourselves	through	the	process	of	self-examination,
we	understand	ourselves	in	a	self-evident	way	in
the	 family,	 society	 and	 state	 in	 which	 we	 live.	 …
The	 self-awareness	 of	 the	 individual	 is	 only	 a
flickering	in	the	closed	circuits	of	historical	life”	(p.
245).
Gadamer	 (1982)	 points	 out	 that	 there	 is	 a
dialectic	or	mutual	influence	between	the	subject
of	interpretation	and	the	interpreter	in	which,	as
the	 horizons	 of	 each	 coparticipate,	 meaning	 is
generated	 in	 that	 particular	 dyadic	 pair	 at	 that
particular	time	and	place.	What	is	known	is	always
known	 by	 a	 knower	 situated	 within	 history	 and
society,	 and	 therefore	 interpretation	 is	 always
conditioned	 and	 influenced	 by	 the	 tradition	 and
the	 horizon	 of	 understanding	 within	 which	 one
operates.	Gadamer	proclaims	that	one	should	not
attempt	 to	 overcome	 the	 “prejudices”	 that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
536
constitute	 our	 sociohistorical	 vantage	 point,
because	no	technique	and	method	can	ever	secure
absolute	
objectivity	
in	
interpretation	
(see
HERMENEUTICS).
Gadamer	(1982)	defines	horizons	as	the	limits
to	our	vantage	point,	the	limits	of	our	empathy.	In
order	for	the	ideas	of	another	person	to	become
intelligible,	we	must	discover	the	standpoint	and
horizon	of	that	person.	Furthermore,	horizons	are
always	 changing	 as	 we	 live	 and	 develop,	 so
whenever	 we	 investigate	 we	 cannot	 disregard
ourselves.	This	investigation,	says	Gadamer,	is	not
primarily	 empathy	 (here	 he	 differs	 sharply	 with
Kohut)	but	the	forming	of	“a	higher	universality”
(p.	272),	a	fusion	of	horizons.	The	search	for	truth,
then,	 has	 to	 do	 with	 a	 dialogue	 between	 what	 is
handed	down	to	us	and	our	willingness	to	test	and
risk	our	prejudices.

HORIZONTAL	SPLIT
In	 The	 Analysis	 of	 the	 Self,	 Kohut	 (1971)
presents	 his	 concept	 of	 the	 vertical	 and	 the
horizontal	split	(see	his	important	diagram	on	p.
185	 [Kohut	 1971]).	 In	 this	 unfortunate	 use	 of
geometry	Kohut	relates	the	vertical	split	to	what
Freud	 in	 a	 different	 context	 thought	 of	 as
disavowal.	 The	 vertically	 split-off	 sector,	 or	 the
disavowed	part	of	the	personality,	is	manifested	in
narcissistic	 personality	 disorders	 by	 openly
displayed	 infantile	 grandiosity,	 which	 alternates
with	 the	 patient’s	 usual	 personality.	 This	 openly
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
538
displayed	 grandiosity,	 says	 Kohut,	 is	 “related	 to
the	 mother’s	 narcissistic	 use	 of	 the	 child’s
performance”	(p.	185).	Yet,	on	the	other	side	of	the
vertical	 split,	 the	 patient	 may	 show	 most	 of	 the
time	 a	 low	 self-esteem,	 shame	 propensity,	 and
hypochondria.	 Psychotherapy	 begins	 by	 dealing
with	the	vertical	split	because	it	is	usually	possible
to	 help	 the	 patient	 develop	 examples	 of	 the
vertically	split-off	sector	from	his	or	her	conscious
everyday	thinking	and	behavior.	This	reduces	the
openly	
displayed	
infantile	
grandiosity	
and
increases	 the	 pressure	 from	 the	 repressed
material	hidden	by	the	horizontal	split.
The	 low	 self-esteem,	 shame	 propensity,	 and
hypochondria	 represent	 a	 reaction	 formation	 to
what	 is	 hidden	 by	 the	 horizontal	 split,	 which
seems	analogous	to	the	repression	barrier.	Under
the	 horizontal	 split	 are	 repressed,	 unfulfilled,
archaic	 narcissistic	 demands,	 representing	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
539
emerging	 true	 self	 of	 the	 child	 that	 should	 have
been	acknowledged	by	the	gleam	in	the	mother’s
eye	 or	 facilitated	 by	 the	 soothing	 of	 a	 mature
parent,	but	were	rejected	by	her.	By	blocking	the
disavowed	expression	of	infantile	narcissism,	the
pressure	of	these	archaic	narcissistic	demands	is
increased	 and	 the	 archaic	 grandiosity	 begins	 to
appear.	 This	 fosters	 the	 development	 of	 what
Kohut	 (1977)	 calls	 selfobject	 transferences	 (see
TRANSFERENCE).

HORNEY,	KAREN
(1885-1952)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
540
In	 general,	 Karen	 Horney	 is	 insufficiently
appreciated	
today.	
Her	
ideas	
still	
remain
extremely	controversial	and	cannot	yet	be	judged
in	 perspective.	 First,	 she	 (1967)	 contended	 that
Freud	 was	 wrong	 in	 his	 postulates	 about	 female
psychology	 (see	 FEMALE	 PSYCHOLOGY);	 second,
she	 emphasized	 the	 subject	 of	 self-realization
much	more	than	he	did.
Kelman	 (1971)	 and	 others	 (see	 Quinn	 1987)
give	 a	 detailed	 exposition	 of	 Horney’s	 life,	 which
included	a	number	of	rather	unpleasant	episodes.
She	was	born	in	Germany,	near	Hamburg,	in	1885.
Her	 father	 was	 a	 sea	 captain,	 a	 Norwegian	 who
had	become	a	German	citizen,	and	her	mother	was
Dutch,	seventeen	years	younger	than	her	husband
and	 of	 a	 different	 temperament.	 He	 was	 morose
and	devoutly	Protestant,	given	to	long	silences	and
bouts	 of	 Bible	 reading,	 while	 she	 was	 attractive
and	 possessed	 a	 taste	 for	 worldly	 living.	 Karen
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
541
Horney	 and	 her	 elder	 brother	 remembered	 as
children	 seeing	 many	 parental	 explosions.	 Her
father	 was	 away	 much	 of	 the	 time	 on	 ocean
voyages,	 and	 she	 both	 admired	 and	 feared	 him;
she	felt	that	her	mother	favored	her	good-looking
older	brother.
At	the	age	of	12	Horney	decided	on	medicine
as	her	future	profession	and	was	supported	in	this
by	 her	 mother,	 who	 helped	 her	 obtain	 an
education,	 even	 though	 her	 father	 adamantly
opposed	 her	 career	 plans.	 The	 family	 turmoil
ended	 with	 both	 mother	 and	 daughter	 leaving
home;	 when	 Horney	 began	 medical	 school,	 her
mother	stayed	with	her.
Horney	 married	 and	 had	 two	 daughters,	 in
1911	 and	 1913,	 the	 same	 year	 she	 received	 her
medical	 degree;	 a	 third	 daughter	 was	 born	 in
1915.	 She	 began	 as	 a	 neurologist	 and	 under	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
542
influence	of	Karl	Abraham	became	involved	with
the	 Berlin	 Psychoanalytic	 Institute.	 Her	 first
psychoanalytic	paper	was	published	in	1917	and
already	showed	some	disagreement	with	Freud.
Horney	
acquired	
a	
reputation	
for
outspokenness,	a	trait	that	did	not	endear	her	to
most	of	her	colleagues,	although	she	rose	steadily
at	 the	 Berlin	 Institute.	 She	 traveled	 frequently,
leaving	her	husband,	a	lawyer,	behind	at	home.	He
began	 to	 drink	 and	 gamble,	 and	 the	 marriage
ended	in	1926.
In	1932,	on	the	invitation	of	Franz	Alexander,
Horney	 became	 the	 assistant	 director	 of	 the
Chicago	
Institute	
for	
Psychoanalysis.	
But
Alexander	and	she	did	not	get	along	very	well,	and
in	
1934	
she	
moved	
to	
the	
New	
York
Psychoanalytic	Institute.
Horney’s	ideas	were	presented	in	her	first	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
543
most	popular	book,	The	Neurotic	Personality	of	Our
Time	(1937).	The	appearance	in	1939	of	Horney’s
New	Ways	in	Psychoanalysis	led	to	the	ugly	episode
of	 a	 complete	 break	 between	 herself,	 together
with	four	others	who	supported	her,	and	the	rest
of	the	New	York	Psychoanalytic	Institute.	She	went
on	to	form	the	Association	for	the	Advancement	of
Psychoanalysis	 and,	 a	 year	 later,	 a	 training
institute,	the	American	Institute	of	Psychoanalysis.
There	were	further	administrative	clashes,	which
in	1943	resulted	in	the	departure	of	Harry	Stack
Sullivan,	 Erich	 Fromm,	 and	 Clara	 Thompson	 for
the	William	Alanson	White	Psychiatric	Foundation
in	New	York.	Horney	remained	at	the	head	of	the
institute	until	her	death	in	1952.
Horney,	
like	
Alfred	
Adler,	
resisted
compartmentalization	 of	 the	 personality	 into
instincts	 and	 forces,	 and	 thus	 basically	 rejected
both	the	Freudian	instinct	theory	and	the	Freudian
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
544
structural	 approach.	 For	 her,	 the	 purpose	 of
psychotherapy	 is	 definitely	 not	 release	 from
repression	 of	 specific	 infantile	 sexual	 material	 of
continuing	 dynamic	 importance.	 In	 The	 Neurotic
Personality	 of	 Our	 Time,	 she	 lays	 down	 the
principles	of	her	approach,	attempting	to	explain
neurotic	phenomena	not	primarily	in	terms	of	the
Oedipus	complex	but	in	terms	of	what	she	called
basic	anxiety,	a	feeling	of	being	small,	insignificant,
helpless,	 endangered,	 in	 a	 world	 that	 is	 out	 to
abuse,	cheat,	attack,	humiliate,	betray,	envy.

HOSPITALISM
Spitz	 (1945)	 published	 some	 remarkable
studies	 of	 children	 up	 to	 18	 months	 old	 who
underwent	 a	 prolonged	 stay	 in	 a	 hospital-type
institution	 completely	 separated	 from	 their
mother.	
The	
investigation	
found	
disorders
involving	 retardation	 of	 development,	 of	 body
mastery,	 of	 adaptation	 to	 the	 environment,	 of
linguistic	capacity,	and	in	the	most	serious	cases	a
loss	of	resistance	to	disease,	which	terminated	in
wasting	and	death.	Spitz	concluded	that	the	effects
of	hospitalism	are	long	term	and	in	some	cases	not
reparable.	 He	 thought	 of	 hospitalism	 as	 a	 total
emotional	 deprivation	 and	 tried	 to	 distinguish	 it
from	what	he	called	anaclitic	depression,	which	he
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
546
viewed	 as	 the	 consequence	 of	 a	 partial	 affective
deprivation	 in	 a	 child	 who	 previously	 enjoyed	 a
normal	relationship	with	its	mother.
What	 is	 clinically	 important	 is	 to	 realize	 that
hospitalism	in	a	less	extreme	form	has	taken	place
in	the	early	lives	of	some	of	our	adult	patients.	In
my	 clinical	 experience	 a	 certain	 subgroup	 of
apparently	 neurotic	 patients	 have	 at	 their	 core
some	 of	 the	 symptoms	 of	 hospitalism,	 and	 these
appear	after	a	sufficient	period	of	regression	in	the
psychoanalytic	 situation.	 A	 sense	 of	 helplessness
and	 hopelessness	 with	 despair	 and	 apathy
characterize	 this	 syndrome,	 along	 with	 an
impairment	of	ego	functioning	in	several	spheres,
including	
linguistic	
confusion,	
self-defeating
“mistakes,”	
and	
even	
disorientation.	
Such
phenomena	should	raise	a	suspicion	in	the	mind	of
the	therapist	that	an	early	period	of	utter	maternal
deprivation	has	been	covered	over	due	to	perhaps
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
547
more	successful	later	parenting	from	the	father	or
other	 family	 members.	 This	 has	 allowed	 the
patient’s	development	to	continue	but	has	left	the
patient	 vulnerable,	 especially	 in	 interpersonal
relationships.	The	latter	are	always	under	a	cloud
because	 the	 patient	 is	 unable	 to	 allow	 the
regression	in	the	service	of	the	ego	that	is	vital	to
the	 development	 of	 true	 intimacy	 with	 another
person.	 Because	 of	 this,	 there	 are	 difficulties	 in
marriage	and	friendship	that	puzzle	the	patient	as
well	 as	 the	 partner.	 The	 resurfacing	 of	 these
problems	in	the	analytic	setting	begins	to	unravel
the	 core	 of	 the	 patient’s	 difficulties	 and	 reveals
what	 has	 made	 it	 impossible	 for	 the	 patient	 to
relate	 successfully.	 Such	 patients	 are	 sometimes
labeled	schizoid;	usually	they	are	able	to	hide	their
problems	 behind	 an	 apparent	 facade	 of	 effective
functioning.	 The	 treatment	 of	 these	 patients	 is
quite	 difficult,	 proceeds	 very	 slowly,	 and	 often
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
548
ends	
unsatisfactorily	
(see	
BEYOND
INTERPRETATION).

HUMANENESS
Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 “humane”	 as
kind,	civil,	benevolent,	and	good	natured	(p.	974).
The	 great	 ethologist	 Konrad	 Lorenz	 (1987),
writing	 about	 the	 imminent	 destruction	 of	 our
environment	and	the	human	species,	as	well	as	the
decline	 of	 attributes	 that	 constitute	 humanity,
transformed	the	adjective	“humane”	into	the	noun
“humaneness.”	 He	 describes	 the	 waning	 of
humaneness	 as	 a	 malady	 and	 recommends	 close
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
549
contact	 with	 nature	 as	 an	 important	 antidote	 to
the	 problem.	 His	 work	 has	 not	 received	 the
attention	 from	 psychotherapists	 that	 it	 deserves.
The	effects	of	the	waning	of	humaneness	are	seen
constantly	in	our	clinical	work.
Lorenz	agrees	with	Freud’s	drive	theory,	for	as
a	
naturalist	
he	
observed	
how	
stimuli
spontaneously	surge	up	“with	great	force”	(p.	129)
when	there	is	no	situation	for	release	(see	DRIVE).
For	 Lorenz,	 as	 for	 Freud	 (1930),	 this	 makes	 the
stress	 of	 culture	 due	 to	 an	 encumbrance	 on	 the
drives	that	each	person	must	bear.	In	our	society,
Lorenz	explains,
one	 of	 the	 most	 dangerously	 vicious	 circles
menacing	 the	 continued	 existence	 of	 all
mankind	 arises	 through	 that	 grim	 striving
for	 the	 highest	 possible	 position	 within	 the
ranked	 order,	 in	 other	 words,	 the	 reckless
pursuit	 of	 power	 which	 combines	 with	 an
insatiable	greed	of	neurotic	proportions	that
the	results	of	acquired	power	confer.	I	have
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
550
already	 noted	 that	 the	 quantity	 of	 what	 is
collected	intensifies	the	drive	to	collect;	the
most	 evil	 of	 the	 reciprocally	 augmenting
intensities	occurs	between	the	acquisition	of
power	and	the	unquenched	thirst	for	power,
[p.	107]
Lorenz	 appropriately	 describes	 the	 “draining
away	of	meaning”	(p.	197)	as	combining	with	the
increased	 technological	 frenzy	 in	 our	 society	 to
produce	the	waning	of	humaneness.	He	points	out
that	 young	 people	 who	 grow	 up	 in	 materialistic
environments	 do	 not	 see	 in	 their	 successful	 and
comfortably	 situated	 fathers	 any	 exemplary
models	worthy	of	imitation,	“especially	when	they
also	 notice	 that	 such	 successful	 men	 are	 on	 the
verge	 of	 heart	 attacks,	 are	 under	 constant	 stress
and	are	not	really	happy	at	all”	(p.	197).
It	is	important	for	psychotherapists	to	keep	in
mind	the	profound	influence	in	our	culture	of	the
waning	 of	 humaneness	 on	 the	 production	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
551
psychopathology.	 In	 fact,	 some	 of	 the	 most
important	traits	of	adaptation	to	a	culture	such	as
ours,	which	Lasch	(1978)	has	labeled	“the	culture
of	 narcissism,”	 may	 be	 the	 very	 aspects	 of	 the
individual’s	 personality	 that	 are	 causing	 the
individual	 the	 most	 personal	 unhappiness.	 This
poses	 some	 very	 thorny	 problems	 in	 making
clinical	
decisions	
and	
interventions	
in
psychotherapy.

HUMAN	SCIENCES
(DILTHEY)
The	 human	 sciences	 include	 psychiatry,
psychology,	 linguistics,	 education,	 economics,
social	
science,	
administration,	
penology,
philosophy,	and	politics.	Although	these	have	been
modeled	 on	 the	 physical	 sciences,	 there	 is	 much
argument	today	as	to	whether	the	method	to	use
in	the	human	sciences	ought	to	be	the	same	as	that
of	the	natural	sciences.	For	example,	the	German
philosopher	
Wilhelm	
Dilthey	
(1831-1911)
distinguished	 the	 natural	 sciences,	 the	 rigorous
and	 empirical	 sciences	 that	 observe	 the	 human
qua	natural	object,	as	in	behavioristic	psychology,
from	Geisteswissenschaften,	or	the	human	sciences.
The	 method	 used	 by	 Geisteswissenschaften	 is
different	and	left	somewhat	vague	by	Dilthey,	who
labeled	 it	 as	 empathy,	 or	 Verstehen.	 One	 must
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
553
remember	that	Dilthey’s	(1978)	manuscripts	were
in	 fragments,	 but	 his	 main	 point	 was	 that	 there
exist	two	“standpoints”	of	experience,	two	ways	of
experiencing	 the	 world:	 (a)	 standing	 back
separately	 and	 observing	 a	 world	 conceived	 as
composed	of	natural	objects,	and	(b)	living	in	the
world—we	 cannot	 ever	 live	 and	 interact	 with
people	 and	 things	 without	 adopting	 a	 stance
toward	them,	an	inextricable	involvement.
To	these	there	correspond	two	ways	of	being
aware	of	experience,	which	Dilthey	(1978)	called
(a)	Erklären,	“knowledge	of	the	laws	of	the	causal
order	 of	 natural	 phenomena”	 (p.	 246),	 rigorous
scientific	
knowledge;	
and	
(b)	
Verstehen,
knowledge	 of	 the	 inner	 mental	 life	 of	 humans,	 a
function	 of	 our	 worldview,	 or	 system	 of	 value-
laden	
and	
meaningful	
experience,	
and	
a
consequence	 of	 our	 being-in-the-world.	 For
Dilthey,	“We	explain	nature,	we	understand	mind”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
554
(p.	246).
Dilthey	 tried	 to	 establish	 Verstehen	 as	 a
method	by	using	the	so-called	hermeneutic	circle:
beginning	with	a	preliminary	notion	of	the	whole,
one	then	moves	to	an	evermore	probing	analysis
and	synthesis	of	the	parts,	which	in	turn	leads	to
an	 evolving,	 ever-changing	 concept	 of	 the	 whole.
This	 affords	 an	 increasingly	 internalized	 and
thought-through	understanding	of	the	whole	(see
HERMENEUTICS).
From	 this	 Dilthey	 attempted	 to	 develop	 a
method	of	understanding	in	human	sciences	that
involved	a	kind	of	empathic	reliving	of	the	culture
or	 the	 historical	 epoch	 that	 produced	 whatever
was	 being	 studied.	 To	 put	 it	 another	 way,
according	 to	 Dilthey	 a	 radically	 different	 method
from	 that	 utilized	 in	 the	 natural	 sciences	 was
required,	one	based	on	an	empathic	identification
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
555
with	 the	 subject	 under	 study	 rather	 than	 on	 an
attempt	 to	 remain	 separate	 and	 “objective.”
Although	 his	 theories	 have	 been	 criticized	 from
many	 directions,	 they	 still	 present	 in	 outline	 a
debate	between	whether	the	psychological	study
of	 humans	 should	 be	 carried	 on	 in	 a	 natural
sciences	 fashion	 or	 through	 the	 method	 of
hermeneutics	 and	 empathy.	 Authors	 disagree,
some	stressing	one	pole	and	some	the	other,	and
some	trying	to	make	the	methods	complementary
and	therefore	synergistic—which	is	very	difficult
to	 do	 because	 their	 premises	 contain	 a	 basic
epistemological	opposition.

HYSTERIA
The	extremely	difficult	nosological	problem	of
what	 we	 mean	 by	 severe	 hysteria	 still	 persists.
Lazare	(1971)	reminds	us	that	Freud’s	early	cases
dealt	
with	
such	
symptoms	
as	
blindness,
convulsions,	 contractures,	 and	 disturbances	 in
sensation.	The	character	traits	usually	associated
with	 hysteria	 involving	 increased	 excitability,
instability	of	mood,	histrionics,	and	suggestibility
were	 mentioned	 only	 in	 passing.	 Hysteria	 was
used	 as	 a	 diagnostic	 term	 for	 those	 various
symptoms	 of	 psychological,	 not	 neurological,
origin	believed	related	to	disturbed	sexuality.
The	 term	 “conversion”	 in	 Breuer	 and	 Freud’s
(1893-1895)	 studies	 on	 hysteria	 is	 used	 in	 the
case	 of	 Emmy	 von	 N.	 (although	 it	 was	 first
introduced	
elsewhere)	
to	
mean	
the
transformation	of	psychical	excitation	into	chronic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
557
somatic	
symptoms.	
Conversion	
(see
CONVERSION)	 remains	 mysterious,	 and	 many
authors	 still	 speak	 of	 the	 inexplicable	 leap	 from
the	 mind	 to	 the	 body.	 The	 question	 of	 whether
conversion	 exists	 solely	 in	 cases	 of	 hysteria	 or
throughout	the	realm	of	psychopathology	remains
a	 matter	 of	 debate	 (Rangell	 1959).	 Certainly	 the
ubiquitous	presence	and	the	unpredictable	shifts
of	 conversion	 symptoms	 form	 one	 of	 the	 most
dramatic	
manifestations	
in	
the	
realm	
of
psychopathology,	 and	 the	 removal	 of	 conversion
symptoms	by	the	use	of	hypnosis	or	barbiturates
is	often	a	convincing	demonstration	to	beginners
of	 the	 influence	 of	 mental	 processes	 on	 body
phenomena.
Florid	 conversion	 symptoms	 today	 are	 rarely
found	
away	
from	
rural	
communities.	
The
disappearance	 of	 dramatic	 classical	 conversion
symptoms	 seems	 to	 be	 related	 to	 the	 growing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
558
sophistication	about	sexuality	in	our	society	and	to
the	 acceptance	 of	 the	 sexual	 needs	 of	 women.
Perhaps	 the	 preponderance	 of	 florid	 conversion
symptoms	among	nineteenth-century	women	can
partly	explain	Freud’s	unfortunate	disparagement
of	 women	 (see	 FEMALE	 PSYCHOLOGY).	 This
disparagement	was	partly	due	to	Freud’s	Victorian
mentality,	and	partly	to	the	then	prevailing	theory
that	hysteria	involved	some	kind	of	degeneracy	or
inferiority	in	the	nervous	system,	a	theory	Freud
gradually	abandoned.
The	early	studies	of	Breuer	and	Freud	(1893-
1895)	attempted	to	establish	a	therapeutic	goal	of
compelling	split-off	ideas	to	unite	once	more	with
the	conscious	stream	of	thought.	Freud	remarked
that,	strangely	enough,	success	does	not	run	with
the	amount	of	work	done;	only	when	the	last	piece
of	 work	 is	 completed	 does	 recovery	 take	 place.
Freud	postulated	in	these	patients	the	existence	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
559
ideas	marked	by	great	intensity	of	feeling	but	cut
off	from	the	rest	of	consciousness.	The	essence	of
therapy	 is	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 the	 ideas	 and	 their
associated	
affect,	
which	
was,	
so	
to	
say,
“strangulated,”	a	principle	that	remains	one	of	the
pillars	 of	 psychotherapeutic	 effort.	 Even	 in	 the
case	 of	 Emmy	 von	 N.,	 Freud	 already	 recognized
that	 suggestion	 and	 abreaction	 are	 not	 enough,
and	he	demonstrated	the	need	to	analyze	down	to
causes	 in	 a	 deterministic	 way.	 Only	 then,	 he	 felt,
can	one	use	the	abreaction	technique	successfully
(see	 ABREACTION).	 Freud	 at	 that	 time	 believed
hysteria	was	due	to	childhood	sexual	traumata	of	a
passive	 nature	 and	 imposed	 on	 the	 child	 quite
early.	He	soon	changed	his	mind	as	a	result	of	his
self-analysis	 as	 revealed	 in	 The	 Interpretation	 of
Dreams	(1900),	and	his	emphasis	shifted	from	the
effect	of	actual	childhood	traumata	to	constructed
memories	or	fantasies	(see	FANTASY).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
560
Freud	 believed	 that	 the	 nucleus	 of	 hysterical
disorders	 was	 always	 in	 an	 improperly	 resolved
oedipal	 conflict.	 He	 divided	 hysterias	 into
conversion	 hysterias	 or	 anxiety	 hysterias.	 Today
the	 latter	 are	 more	 often	 labeled	 phobias.	 In
addition	 to	 the	 innumerable	 possible	 bodily
symptoms	 of	 conversion	 hysteria,	 there	 is	 often
the	appearance	of	an	apparent	indifference	to	the
nature	 of	 the	 situation	 known	 as	 la	 belle
indifference.	 There	 may	 be	 episodic	 shifts	 in
mental	 states	 with	 quite	 theatrical	 hysterical
spells	 or	 “seizures”	 that	 may	 involve	 the
dissociation	of	certain	mental	functions,	producing
such	histrionic	situations	as	multiple	personalities,
fugue	states,	and	somnambulism.
Although	 repressed	 incestuous	 wishes	 were
long	thought	of	as	basic	to	hysterical	phenomena,
there	 has	 been	 an	 increasing	 recognition	 of	 the
effect	 of	 preoedipal	 conflicts	 in	 many	 cases	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
561
hysteria.	Hysterical	symptoms	express	in	a	form	of
body	 language	 the	 specific	 unconscious	 fantasies
that	the	patient	has	developed	as	a	compromise	in
the	 conflict	 between	 an	 instinctual	 wish	 that
provokes	 anxiety	 and	 the	 defense	 against	 that
wish.	 Both	 the	 instinctual	 wish	 and	 the	 defense
against	it	are	reenacted	in	the	symptom,	and	the
disability	
often	
represents	
a	
masochistic
punishment	 for	 the	 partial	 gratification	 of	 the
instinctual	desire	hidden	in	the	forbidden	fantasy.
Some	 authors	 distinguish	 between	 conversion
hysteria	 as	 a	 psychoneurosis	 and	 the	 so-called
hysterical	 character,	 who	 acts	 out	 theatrically	 or
histrionically	
exhibitionistic,	
seductive,	
and
flirtatious	 behavior,	 with	 extremes	 of	 mood
prevailing,	but	in	intimate	relationships	is	actually
quite	fearful	and	inhibited.
Treatment	of	hysteria	with	psychoanalysis	has
turned	 out	 to	 be	 much	 more	 difficult	 than
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
562
originally	 believed.	 Chronic	 cases	 often	 include
much	 secondary	 gain	 and	 so	 patients	 cling
tenaciously	to	their	symptoms	or	quickly	develop
new	 ones.	 More	 recent	 onset	 of	 symptoms	 has	 a
better	 prognosis	 but	 the	 success	 depends	 on	 the
relative	preponderance	of	oedipal	and	preoedipal
pathology.	 The	 “good,”	 that	 is	 treatable,	 hysteric
has	primarily	an	unresolved	Oedipus	complex	and
has	 only	 recently	 regressed	 from	 an	 intolerable
life	 situation	 to	 the	 oedipal	 fixation	 point	 (see
FIXATION)	and	formed	symptoms.	She	(or	he)	is
young,	
highly	
motivated	
for	
treatment,
psychologically	 minded,	 has	 the	 time	 and	 money
for	 psychoanalysis,	 and	 shows	 little	 secondary
gain	from	the	illness.

I
ID
In	An	 Outline	 of	 Psychoanalysis,	 Freud	 (1940)
tells	us	that	the	“core	of	our	being,	then,	is	formed
by	 the	 obscure	 id,	 which	 has	 no	 direct
communication	 with	 the	 external	 world	 and	 is
accessible	 even	 to	 our	 own	 knowledge	 only
through	the	medium	of	another	agency”	(p.	197).
For	Freud,	the	id	plays	the	role	that	the	noumenal
world	plays	for	Kant.	Freud	then	proceeds	to	tell
us	 about	 this	 obscure,	 unknowable	 id	 in	 his
discussion	 of	 the	 primal	 organic	 instincts,	 as	 he
calls	 them,	 that	 operate	 within	 it	 (see	 DEATH
INSTINCT).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
565
The	 id	 arises	 from	 and	 represents	 the
biological	 furnace	 of	 the	 body.	 From	 the	 id
emanates	 the	 fury	 and	 the	 passion	 of	 the
organism.	 At	 its	 base	 we	 conceive	 of	 an	 energy
system,	 arising	 from	 the	 body’s	 biochemical
processes,	 that	 requires	 the	 body	 to	 replenish
itself	and	to	maintain	physiologic	equilibrium.	The
id	 may	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 containing	 all	 that	 is
inherited	and	fixed	in	the	constitution.	It	may	be
thought	of	as	a	cauldron	of	seething	excitement	or
chaos.	 It	 represents	 all	 the	 somatic	 processes	 of
the	body	reflected	on	a	psychological	level;	that	is,
eventually	all	the	important	somatic	processes	of
the	body	have	a	psychic	representation	in	the	id.
The	characteristics	of	the	id	are	as	follows:
1.	The	id	is	completely	unconscious	and	always
remains	so.	It	consists	of	images	in	chaos,	a
cauldron	 of	 seething	 biologically	 driven
excitement.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
566
2.	The	id	is	that	part	of	the	mind	that	contains
everything	
inherited,	
especially	
the
instincts,	 or	 drives.	 The	 drives	 fill	 the	 id
with	 energy	 and	 press	 for	 immediate
satisfaction.	 The	 id	 has	 no	 organization
and	no	will.	Its	only	purpose	is	to	satisfy
the	drives	(see	DRIVE).
3.	 There	 is	 no	 negation	 in	 the	 id,	 only	 desires,
which	demand	satisfaction.
4.	The	id	knows	no	values,	no	good,	no	bad,	no
evil,	no	morality.
5.	 Contradictory	 impulses	 may	 occur	 in	 the	 id,
and	they	may	exist	independently	side	by
side—love	 and	 hate,	 for	 example.	 Such
contradictory	 impulses	 do	 not	 detract
from	one	another,	nor	can	they	cancel	each
other.
6.	 The	 processes	 of	 the	 id	 are	 not	 related	 to
reality;	 they	 are	 subject	 only	 to	 what	 we
call	 the	 pleasure	 principle,	 which	 may	 be
described	 as	 “I	 want	 what	 I	 want	 when	 I
want	it.”
7.	The	processes	of	the	id	are	timeless;	that	is,	an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
567
unfulfilled	 need	 remains	 unchanged	 and
unfulfilled	 if	 nothing	 has	 been	 done,
regardless	of	the	passage	of	years.
8.	 The	 id	 is	 subject	 to	 the	 mechanism	 of
displacement.	Images	from	it	often	appear
in	a	disguised	condensed	form	in	dreams.
Freud	took	his	concept	of	the	id	from	Groddeck
(1961),	 an	 extremely	 intuitive,	 dramatic,	 and
imaginative	man	who	attributed	an	overwhelming
power	to	the	“It”	in	both	organic	and	psychic	life.
Groddeck	has	been	neglected	by	psychotherapists,
but	his	work	deserves	careful	study.	It	abandons
the	 distinction	 between	 the	 mental	 and	 the
organic,	 although	 Groddeck	 was	 primarily	 an
internist	who	later	labeled	himself	a	“wild	analyst”
(Grossman	and	Grossman	1965).	For	the	extremist
Groddeck,	 the	 It	 shapes	 our	 lives.	 Diagnosis	 is
simply	 a	 label	 from	 a	 physician,	 but	 it	 is	 the	 all-
powerful	It	that	chooses	the	disease	and	allows	it
to	heal.	For	Groddeck,	in	a	sense	we	are	lived	by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
568
the	It,	a	concept	picked	up	by	Lacan	(see	LACAN),
but	Lacan	does	not	use	Freud’s	structural	theory,
which	includes	the	concept	of	the	id.
A	more	traditional	discussion	of	the	id	is	found
in	 Schur	 (1966),	 who	 conceives	 of	 the	 id	 as
containing	 not	 only	 psychic	 energy	 but	 also
psychic	
contents.	
The	
pleasure	
principle
predominates	in	the	id	as	well	as	the	unpleasure
principle,	 which	 regulates	 the	 necessity	 to
withdraw	 from	 excessive	 stimuli.	 For	 Schur,
thought	 is	 organized	 according	 to	 primary	 or
secondary	process	on	a	continuum	from	the	id	to
the	 ego.	 The	 id	 is	 the	 reservoir	 of	 the	 psychic
representatives	 of	 the	 drives	 and	 of	 all	 the
phylogenetic	 acquisitions.	 According	 to	 Freud,	 it
comprises	the	total	mental	apparatus	at	birth;	in
development	 the	 ego	 and	 the	 superego	 become
differentiated	 from	 the	 id.	 Freud	 (1933)	 tells	 us
that	instinctual	cathexes	seeking	discharge	are	all
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
569
that	the	id	contains.	This	encompasses	the	mental
representations	of	the	instinctual	drives	but	does
not	 include	 all	 the	 contents	 of	 the	 system
unconscious	 from	 Freud’s	 earlier	 topographic
theory.
The	concept	of	the	id	is	controversial.	There	is
considerable	 disagreement	 as	 to	 whether	 the	 id
has	 any	 mental	 contents	 at	 all	 or	 is	 simply
composed	 of	 biological	 forces.	 Should	 repressed
unconscious	memories	and	fantasies	be	assigned
there,	
or	
only	
what	
has	
never	
reached
consciousness	 or	 achieved	 representability?	 Slap
and	 Saykin	 (1984)	 point	 out	 that	 the	 recent
psychoanalytic	 literature	 has	 no	 references	 with
the	 term	 “id”	 in	 the	 title.	 Without	 this	 concept,
however,	 the	 entire	 structural	 theory	 has	 no
meaning,	 just	 as	 in	 the	 philosophy	 of	 Kant,	 the
noumenal	world	is	assumed	to	be	the	unknowable
basis	of	our	mentation	and	experience.	I	(Chessick
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
570
1980)	 have	 elsewhere	 tried	 to	 demonstrate	 this
shift	toward	a	Kantian	position	in	Freud’s	thought
as	 he	 moved	 from	 the	 topographic	 to	 the
structural	 theory.	 This	 shift	 contains	 the	 same
metapsychological	
weaknesses	
as	
the
metaphysical	 weaknesses	 in	 Kant’s	 philosophy
and	leaves	many	problems	unresolved.

IDEALIZATION
Idealization	 occurs	 in	 both	 of	 Klein’s	 basic
positions,	
the	
paranoid-schizoid	
and	
the
depressive,	 as	 a	 defense	 against	 sadism	 and
destruction	 in	 phantasy	 (Segal	 1974,	 1980)	 (see
PHANTASY).	 Internalized	 bad	 objects	 are	 no
longer	 projected	 in	 the	 depressive	 position,	 nor
are	they	reintrojected;	instead,	the	total	object	is
experienced	and	the	bad	objects	remain,	forming
the	basis	of	the	primitive	superego,	which	attacks
the	 ego	 or	 self	 with	 guilt	 feelings.	 Good	 internal
objects	attenuate	this	attack.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
572
This	idealization	of	good	internal	objects	leads
to	problems	because	the	standards	set	by	or	the
demands	coming	from	the	idealized	good	internal
objects	 become,	 when	 combined	 with	 sadistic
superego	precursors,	cruel	demands	for	perfection
leading	 to	 an	 unremitting	 harshness	 of	 the
superego.	This	is	complicated	in	cases	where	there
is	much	sadism	from	the	need	to	protect	the	good
objects	in	the	superego	by	excessive	idealization.
Idealization	
represents	
an	
unrealistic
exaggeration	of	a	subject’s	personal	attributes.	It
may	
occur	
in	
both	
the	
transference	
and
narcissistic	neuroses.	Idealization	is	related	to	the
state	 of	 being	 in	 love	 (see	 LOVE).	 In	 the
transference	 neuroses,	 idealization	 does	 not	 lose
touch	 entirely	 with	 the	 realistic	 features	 and
limitations	 of	 the	 object.	 In	 typical	 neurotic
situations,	idealization	can	represent	a	projection
of	 the	 analysand’s	 idealized	 superego	 onto	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
573
analyst	 and	 can	 form	 a	 part	 of	 the	 positive
transference,	 or	 defensive	 idealizations	 can	 form
against	 transference	 hostility	 (see	 IDEALIZING
TRANSFERENCE).
In	the	narcissistic	disorders,	the	unconscious	is
fixated	 on	 an	 idealized	 selfobject	 for	 which	 it
continues	 to	 yearn,	 according	 to	 Kohut’s	 (1977)
theory	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY).	 Persons	 with
such	disorders	are	forever	searching	for	external
omnipotent	 powers	 from	 whose	 support	 and
approval	 they	 attempt	 to	 derive	 strength.	 In	 the
narcissistic	 idealizing	 transferences,	 there	 is	 a
sense	of	a	vague	idealization	that	becomes	central
to	the	material.	This	can	lead	to	the	extreme	belief
that	the	therapist	is	divine.	The	therapist,	then,	is
not	 able	 to	 relate	 to	 the	 patient	 as	 one	 human
being	 to	 another,	 but	 rather	 must	 deal	 with	 an
eerie	 quality	 of	 unreasonable	 exaltation	 coming
from	 the	 patient.	 The	 therapist	 reacts	 with
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
574
embarrassment	and	negativism	if	he	or	she	does
not	understand	the	material.	The	intensity	of	the
distortion	 gives	 the	 therapist	 an	 idea	 of	 how
desperate	 the	 patient	 is.	 The	 greater	 the
desperation,	 the	 greater	 the	 requirement	 for
soothing	 from	 the	 therapist	 (see	 IDEALIZING
TRANSFERENCE).	 The	 big	 debate	 between	 the
followers	of	Klein	or	Kernberg	and	the	followers	of
Kohut	
involves	
the	
question	
of	
whether
idealization	 as	 it	 appears	 in	 the	 transference	 is
defensive	 or	 represents	 the	 breaking	 through	 of
archaic	 unresolved	 narcissistic	 needs	 for	 an
idealized	parent	imago	(see	GRANDIOSE	SELF).
Idealization	of	the	parents	is	important	in	the
formation	 of	 the	 superego	 and	 can	 continue
throughout	life,	becoming	an	especially	important
growth-promoting	 feature	 during	 adolescence.
Freud	 originally	 discussed	 idealization	 as	 part	 of
the	 sexual	 overestimation	 of	 the	 love	 object,	 but
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
575
the	term	has	been	used	in	a	more	general	sense	to
deal	with	narcissistic	needs	in	which	some	of	the
self-love	 of	 the	 child	 is	 transferred	 or	 displaced
onto	 a	 substitute	 that	 becomes	 the	 ego-ideal	 or
superego	and	is	looked	upon	as	the	possessor	of
all	perfections	(see	EGO-IDEAL).

IDEALIZED	PARENT	IMAGO
(see	GRANDIOSE	SELF)
IDEALIZING	TRANSFERENCE
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
576
As	a	consequence	of	developmental	arrest	and
failure	 to	 integrate	 the	 archaic	 structures	 of	 the
grandiose	 self	 and	 the	 idealized	 parent	 imago,
characteristic	 selfobject	 transferences	 (Kohut
1977)	 occur	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 narcissistic
personality	disorders.	These	transferences	are	the
result	 of	 the	 amalgamation	 of	 the	 unconscious
archaic	 narcissistic	 structures	 with	 the	 psychic
representation	 of	 the	 analyst	 under	 the	 pressure
of	 the	 need	 to	 relieve	 the	 unfulfilled	 narcissistic
needs	 of	 childhood.	 It	 remains	 questionable
whether	they	are	to	be	called	transferences	in	the
strict	sense.	They	are	not	motivated	by	the	need	to
discharge	 instinctual	 tensions,	 nor	 are	 they
produced	 by	 cathecting	 the	 analyst	 with	 object
libido.	 One	 may	 wish	 to	 think	 of	 them	 as
transferencelike	
phenomena,	
but	
following
Kohut’s	(1977)	later	writing	we	will	refer	to	them
as	selfobject	transferences.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
577
The	
goal	
of	
the	
idealizing	
selfobject
transference	is	to	share,	via	a	merger,	in	the	power
and	omnipotence	of	the	therapist.	Occurring	as	the
result	of	therapeutic	mobilization	of	the	idealized
parent	 imago	 are	 two	 basic	 types	 of	 such
transferences,	 with	 a	 variety	 of	 gradations	 in
between.	 The	 most	 obvious	 type	 is	 a	 later
formation,	
usually	
based	
on	
a	
failure	
of
idealization	of	the	father,	that	stresses	the	search
for	an	idealized	parent	to	which	the	patient	must
be	 attached	 in	 order	 to	 feel	 approved	 and
protected.	 A	 more	 archaic	 type	 of	 selfobject
transference	may	appear	or	be	hidden	under	the
other	types;	this	transference	is	usually	related	to
a	failure	with	the	mother,	in	which	the	stress	is	on
an	 ecstatic	 merger	 and	 mystical	 union	 with	 the
godlike	idealized	parent.
Once	 such	 a	 transference	 has	 been	 formed,
clinical	 signs	 of	 its	 disturbance	 are	 a	 cold,	 aloof,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
578
angry,	 raging	 withdrawal,	 which	 represents	 a
swing	
to	
the	
grandiose	
self;	
feelings	
of
fragmentation	 and	 hypochondria	 due	 to	 the
separation;	
and	
the	
creation	
of	
eroticized
replacements	 by	 frantic	 activities	 and	 fantasies,
especially	 those	 involving	 voyeurism,	 with	 many
variations.	The	typical	countertransference	to	the
idealizing	 selfobject	 transferences	 (Kohut	 1971)
occurs	 through	 the	 mobilization	 of	 the	 archaic
grandiose	self	in	whatever	unanalyzed	residue	is
present	 in	 the	 therapist.	 This	 leads	 to	 an
embarrassed	and	defensive	straight	arming	of	the
patient	 by	 denying	 the	 patient’s	 idealization,
joking	about	it,	or	trying	vigorously	to	interpret	it
away.	 Such	 countertransference	 produces	 in	 the
patient	the	typical	signs	of	disturbance	and	retreat
to	the	grandiose	self	just	mentioned.

IDENTIFICATION,
INTROJECTION,
INCORPORATION
There	are	three	terms	that	have	been	mixed	up
repeatedly	 and	 that	 represent	 subclasses	 of	 the
classical	mechanisms	of	internalization.	They	must
be	understood	in	order	to	distinguish	them	from
Kohut’s	 (1971)	 “transmuting	 internalization.”
Identification	 is	 the	 most	 mature	 of	 these
mechanisms	 (for	 a	 review	 of	 the	 concept,	 see
Compton	 1985).	 It	 is	 less	 directly	 dependent	 on
the	drives,	is	more	adaptively	selective,	and	is	the
least	ambivalent.	It	represents	a	modeling	process,
such	 as	 the	 original	 modeling	 we	 do	 on	 our
parents.	Identification	is	an	automatic	and	usually
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
580
unconscious	
mental	
process	
whereby	
an
individual	becomes	like	another	person	in	one	or
several	
aspects.	
At	
times	
it	
can	
become
consciously	and	deliberately	employed.	It	is	part	of
the	 learning	 process,	 but	 it	 can	 also	 be	 part	 of
adaptation	to	a	feared	or	lost	object,	or	an	attempt
to	improve	one’s	skills	in	society.	Identification	is
growth	promoting	and	leads	to	better	adaptation,
a	crucial	clinical	point.	Some	authors	use	the	term
to	 denote	 a	 defense	 mechanism	 operating
unconsciously	 by	 which	 an	 individual	 patterns
himself	 or	 herself	 after	 another.	 An	 example	 is
Anna	 Freud’s	 (1946)	 “identification	 with	 the
aggressor,”	 which	 plays	 a	 major	 role	 in	 the
development	 of	 the	 superego.	 For	 such	 authors,
the	
conscious	
process	
of	
identification	
is
sometimes	 labeled	 “imitation”	 to	 distinguish	 it
from	unconscious	identification.
Avoiding	
the	
subtle	
arguments	
and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
581
differentiations	among	these	various	processes	of
internalization,	we	turn	next	to	incorporation	and
introjection,	archaic	prototypes	of	identification	in
which	 the	 mental	 process	 is	 sometimes	 even
experienced	 as	 a	 bodily	 one,	 such	 as	 ingesting,
devouring,	 or	 keeping	 something	 inside	 oneself.
Introjection	was	originally	used	by	Freud	(1917)
as	a	process	in	which	the	lost	object	is	taken	in	and
retained	as	part	of	the	psychic	structure.	He	later
used	it	as	a	mechanism	to	explain	the	taking	in	of
the	parents’	demands	as	if	they	were	one’s	own	in
the	 formation	 of	 the	 superego	 at	 the	 time	 of	 the
resolution	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex.	 Introjection
does	 not	 simply	 copy	 selected	 aspects	 of	 the
object,	
as	
in	
identification;	
it	
is	
more
encompassing.	 The	 original	 definition	 assumed	 a
solid	 repression	 barrier,	 a	 cohesive	 sense	 of	 self,
and	a	functioning	ego.	This	was	Freud’s	use	of	the
term.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
582
Incorporation	
is	
a	
form	
or	
model	
of
introjection,	a	taking	into	the	mind	the	attributes
of	 another	 person,	 which	 in	 fantasy	 follows	 the
model	
of	
oral	
ingestion	
and	
swallowing.
Introjection,	
when	
it	
is	
accomplished	
by
incorporation,	
implies	
change	
by	
fantasied
cannibalism.	It	is	primary	process	ideation,	a	form
of	 object	 relatedness,	 a	 primitive	 kind	 of
interpersonal	relations	fantasy.	At	one	time	it	was
thought	
that	
this	
fantasy	
accompanies	
all
introjection,	 but	 now	 this	 is	 not	 believed	 to	 be
correct.
Schafer	 (1968)	 defines	 introjection	 as	 “the
process	 whereby	 object	 representations	 are
constituted	as	introjects	or	are	changed	into	them”
(p.	 16).	 An	 introject,	 he	 explains,	 is	 an	 inner
presence	 with	 which	 one	 feels	 in	 continuous	 or
intermittent	
dynamic	
relationship.	
The
characteristics	of	introjects	are	the	following:
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
583
1.	They	may	be	conceived	as	a	personlike	thing
or	creature.
2.	 They	 may	 be	 unconscious,	 preconscious,	 or
conscious.
3.	 They	 may	 be	 experienced	 as	 exerting	 a
pressure	or	influence	on	the	subject’s	state
or	 behavior	 independently	 of	 conscious
efforts	to	control	it.
4.	They	do	not	copy	external	objects,	since	they
are	 shaped	 by	 “fantasies,	 projections,
symbolizations,	
misunderstandings,
idealizations,	 depreciations,	 and	 selective
biases	 originating	 in	 the	 subject’s	 past
history	 and	 present	 developmental	 phase
in	dynamic	position”	(p.	73).
5.	Once	formed,	introjects	diminish	the	influence
of	 the	 external	 object.	 This	 is	 a	 crucial
clinical	point.	Introjects	are	formed	due	to
a	
severe	
ambivalence	
or	
to
disappointment	 in	 the	 attempt	 to	 modify
distressing	 relations	 with	 an	 external
object.	Good	introjects	are	also	needed	and
formed	to	counteract	and	protect	a	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
584
from	the	bad.
6.	Once	formed,	introjects	alter	the	relationship
with	 the	 external	 object	 in	 a	 way	 not
correctable	 by	 experiences	 with	 the
external	object,	since	the	external	object’s
influence	 is	 diminished	 by	 the	 patient’s
attention	turning	toward	the	introjects.
7.	Introjection	is	an	event,	a	change	in	psychic
organization	 and	 in	 the	 psychic	 status	 of
an	object	representation.	Notice	the	active
role	 of	 the	 mental	 processes	 in	 this,	 a
capability	assumed	even	of	the	infant.	This
is	a	highly	controversial	point.
8.	 Introjection	 represents	 or	 expresses	 a
regressive	modification	of	the	boundaries
and	 reality	 testing	 function	 of	 the	 ego.
Introjection	 perpetuates	 neediness	 and
ambivalence,	displacing	it	to	the	inside.	It
is	 not	 growth	 promoting	 per	 se.	 It	 is	 a
passive	mode	of	mastery	and	not	adaptive
in	itself.
There	
is	
tremendous	
confusion	
in	
the
literature	 about	 these	 three	 terms,	 and	 they	 are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
585
used	in	many	different	ways	by	different	authors.
For	 example,	 Campbell	 (1989)	 notes,	 “Some
writers	 use	 incorporation	 synonymously	 with
identification	 and	 introjection.	 Others	 equate
incorporation	with	introjection	and	define	both	as
the	mechanism	by	which	identification	takes	place.
Others	differentiate	between	them	on	the	basis	of
the	 phase	 or	 level	 of	 psychic	 organization	 and
development	 at	 which	 the	 assimilation	 of	 the
object	 takes	 place”	 (p.	 364).	 I	 have	 attempted	 to
offer	 the	 definitions	 above	 as	 a	 useful	 starting
point	 for	 the	 working	 clinician,	 but	 there	 is	 an
enormous	amount	of	metapsychological	argument
and	confusion	about	their	exact	meanings.

IDENTITY
This	 concept	 is	 more	 psychosocial	 than
psychoanalytic.	 It	 was	 stressed	 very	 much	 in	 the
work	of	Erik	Erikson	(1959).	Identity	refers	to	the
individual’s	 self-image	 with	 respect	 to	 particular
functions	or	roles	in	the	family	or	society,	such	as
gender,	 class,	 and	 work	 identity.	 It	 is	 very	 much
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
587
shaped	 by	 environmental	 and	 social	 events	 in
interaction	
with	
the	
patient’s	
intrapsychic
compromises.	 There	 are	 certain	 periods	 of	 time
when	 the	 individual’s	 sense	 of	 identity	 becomes
challenged,	and	Erikson	has	labeled	these	identity
crises.	Such	crises	are	characteristic	especially	of
adolescents	 and	 include	 the	 so-called	 mid-life
crisis	 of	 adults.	 This	 term	 and	 what	 it	 implies	 is
based	 on	 a	 superficial	 social	 or	 interreactional
view	 of	 psychic	 functioning	 and	 ignores	 the
powerful	underlying	infantile	fantasies	that	drive
our	
personalities.	
A	
great	
many	
popular
psychology	texts	have	been	devoted	to	this	topic,
with	little	benefit	except	to	the	bank	account	of	the
authors	and	lecturers.
Abend	(1974)	reviews	the	concept	of	identity
and	 reminds	 us	 how	 Erikson	 emphasizes	 social
values,	 roles,	 and	 ideals,	 rather	 than	 the	 internal
sense	 and	 the	 body	 image.	 Abend	 distinguishes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
588
between	 personal	 identity,	 which	 makes	 the
individual	 feel	 unique	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 world,
and	identity,	which	is	a	set	of	self	representations
that	 define	 the	 individual	 in	 social	 contacts.	 The
sense	of	identity	is	subjective	and	fluctuating.	Our
sexual	identity,	a	set	of	self	representations	about
our	 sexual	 role	 and	 function	 as	 well	 as	 our
genitals,	 forms	 a	 central	 aspect	 of	 ourselves.	 An
identity	
problem	
occurs	
when	
there	
are
disturbances	 in	 the	 stable	 social,	 sexual,	 and
professional	 roles	 that	 we	 play	 and/or	 in	 our
ideals,	values,	beliefs,	and	special	interests.
An	 interesting	 twist	 is	 given	 by	 Joseph	 and
Widlocher	 (1983),	 who	 edited	 a	 collection	 of
articles	
dealing	
with	
the	
identity	
of	
the
psychoanalyst.	For	example,	King	points	out	how
the	esteem	of	colleagues	is	even	more	important
than	 money	 to	 the	 professional	 because	 it
enhances	identity	and	self-esteem.	She	views	45	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
589
65	years	of	age	as	the	peak	creative	period	for	an
analyst,	and	she	warns	of	the	vocational	danger	of
becoming	isolated.	The	analyst	must	mourn	what
is	not	possible	and	must	reassess	where	he	or	she
stands	with	respect	to	theory,	as	well	as	redefine
continuously	 goals,	 lifestyle,	 and	 ideals.	 Grinberg
decries	 the	 “pseudoidentity”	 of	 the	 analyst	 who
adheres	 to	 the	 latest	 fashionable	 author	 and
whose	 work	 is	 meaningless	 and	 not	 integrated
into	his	or	her	personal	life.	Anna	Freud	interprets
the	 identity	 of	 the	 psychoanalyst	 as	 based	 on	 a
curiosity	about	what	makes	others	function.	This
curiosity,	she	says,	should	carry	through	the	whole
of	 the	 professional	 life	 of	 the	 analyst.	 She	 asks
candidates,	“What	have	you	read?	What	have	you
done	 in	 your	 life?”	 (p.	 261).	 Even	 from	 this	 it
should	be	clear	that	Erikson’s	(1959)	fifth	stage	of
human	 development,	 which	 he	 labels	 identity
versus	 role	 diffusion,	 is	 not	 confined	 to	 late
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
590
adolescence	and	early	adulthood,	but	is	a	problem
that	exists	throughout	life.
Gender	identity	is	the	basic	sense	of	maleness
or	femaleness,	and	it	rests	on	a	strong	conviction
developed	very	early	in	life	that	one	is	either	male
or	 female.	 It	 is	 usually	 clear	 by	 the	 age	 of	 2	 and
relatively	 impossible	 to	 modify	 by	 the	 age	 of	 4.
There	 is	 no	 agreement	 to	 what	 extent	 biological
factors	 contribute	 to	 gender	 identity,	 and	 it	 is
important	to	distinguish	between	gender	identity
and	 “gender	 role”;	 the	 latter	 is	 a	 much	 more
sociological	 concept	 and	 is	 formed	 by	 society’s
expectations.

IDEOGRAPHIC
The	German	philosopher	Wilhelm	Windelband
(1848-1915)	 distinguished	 studying	 an	 object
from	 a	 nomothetic	 or	 from	 an	 ideographic
standpoint.	 Nomothetic	 studies	 concentrate	 on
general	laws,	such	as	the	descriptions	of	empirical
natural	science.	Ideographic	studies	stress	specific
and	unique	individuality.	This	distinction	is	used
by	 Meissner	 (1971),	 who	 describes	 Freud’s
psychoanalysis	 as	 a	 scientific	 hybrid	 resting	 on
and	trying	to	combine	two	poles:	(a)	nomothetic—
using	 rules,	 laws,	 mathematical	 physics,	 and
energy,	 and	 (b)	 ideographic—representing	 ideas
by	 symbols	 that	 are	 unique,	 characteristically
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
592
human,	and	have	subjective	meaning.
Many	 authors	 argue	 that	 the	 human	 sciences
by	 their	 very	 nature	 must	 be	 such	 a	 hybrid	 (see
HERMENEUTICS	 and	 HUMAN	 SCIENCES).	 The
contemporary	psychiatrist	cannot	ever,	by	virtue
of	his	or	her	subject	matter,	the	human	mind,	be
purely	a	medical	specialist.	This	is	because	if	he	or
she	tries	to	be,	the	very	subject	of	the	study,	the
human	being,	will	disappear	and	the	psychiatrist
will	 end	 up	 studying	 a	 thing,	 a	 machine,	 an
apparatus.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 extraordinary
paradoxes	 of	 our	 profession	 and	 it	 means	 that
regardless	 of	 advances	 in	 neurophysiology	 and
neurochemistry,	
the	
psychotherapist	
and
psychiatrist	will	never	be	able	to	escape	from	the
effect	 of	 psychological	 and	 cultural	 factors	 in
shaping	 the	 patient,	 the	 treatment,	 and	 even	 the
psychiatrist	or	psychotherapist.

IDOLS
Any	method	contains	within	it	presuppositions
about	 truth	 and	 falsity	 and	 about	 how	 these	 are

cave,”	which	represent	cultural	prejudices,	such	as
chauvinism,	 feminism,	 and	 racism,	 and	 vastly
distort	 the	 interpretation	 of	 data;	 “idols	 of	 the
marketplace,”	 which	 point	 to	 our	 immersion	 in
language	 and	 the	 impossibility	 of	 getting	 away
from	 current	 linguistic	 practices	 in	 trying	 to
describe	 meanings	 and	 interpretations;	 “idols	 of
the	 theater,”	 in	 which	 an	 appeal	 is	 made	 to
established	
authority,	
such	
as	
systems	
of
philosophy	that	have	become	famous	because	they
are	“classical”;	and,	finally,	“idols	of	the	schools,”	in
which	appeal	is	made	to	authoritative	rules	rather
than	reason	and	judgment.

IMPASSE
There	is	a	need	in	the	psychoanalytic	literature
for	 further	 studies	 on	 the	 problem	 of	 the
treatment	 that	 has	 reached	 an	 impasse.	 An
impasse	
is	
an	
insidious	
arrest	
of	
the
psychoanalytic	
process.	
As	
discussed	
by
Etchegoyen	(1991),	“It	tends	to	perpetuate	itself;
the	setting	is	preserved	in	its	basic	constants;	its
existence	is	not	obvious	as	incoercible	resistance
or	 technical	 error;	 it	 is	 rooted	 in	 the	 patient’s
psychopathology;	 and	 it	 involves	 the	 analyst’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
597
countertransference”	(p.	786).
An	impasse	occurring	even	in	one	single	case	is
very	 serious	 for	 the	 conscientious	 psychoanalyst
because	it	forces	the	analyst	to	review	his	or	her
entire	professional	choice,	theoretical	orientation,
and	 discipline.	 It	 is	 not	 the	 same	 as	 failure	 or
interruption	 of	 treatment,	 which	 usually	 can	 be
traced	
to	
relatively	
obvious	
personal	
and
recognizable	 faults	 in	 both	 the	 patient	 and	 the
analyst.	The	impasse,	on	the	other	hand	involves	a
very	 subtle	 interaction	 between	 the	 analyst	 and
the	patient	so	that	it	may	go	on	for	months	or	even
years	 before	 the	 analyst	 realizes	 what	 has
happened.	In	fact,	the	patient	who	is	suffering	the
impasse	 not	 only	 often	 does	 not	 mention	 it,	 but
will	 resolutely	 deny	 it	 if	 it	 is	 suggested	 by	 the
analyst.	It	is	complex	and	multidetermined	and	the
countertransference	 is	 always	 deeply	 and	 subtly
involved.	 In	 my	 clinical	 experience,	 when	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
598
analyst	 realizes	 that	 an	 impasse	 has	 occurred,	 it
may	be	a	shocking	and	humiliating	experience	and
requires	 serious	 self-analytic	 study	 (see	 the
concept	 of	 countertransference	 structure	 in
COUNTERTRANSFERENCE).

INSTINCT
(see	also	DEATH	INSTINCT	AND	DRIVE)
Probably	no	other	concept	has	caused	as	much
confusion	and	difficulty	for	students	of	Freud	than
his	notion	of	instinct	(Trieb).	Freud	(1920)	himself
described	instinct	as	“at	once	the	most	important
and	 the	 most	 obscure	 element	 of	 psychological
research”	 (p.	 34).	 The	 main	 reason	 for	 this
obscurity	is	that	Freud’s	“instinct”	refers	us	to	the
unresolved	 issue	 of	 the	 borderline	 between	 the
mind	 and	 the	 body.	 Freud	 (1905)	 at	 the	 start
defined	 it	 as	 “the	 psychical	 representative	 of	 an
endosomatic,	 continuously	 floating	 source	 of
stimulation”	 (p.	 168),	 a	 concept	 lying	 on	 the
frontier	 between	 the	 mental	 and	 the	 physical.	 In
this	 early	 definition	 he	 did	 not	 distinguish
between	
an	
instinct	
and	
its	
“psychical
representative,”	but	in	later	work	he	drew	a	sharp
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
600
distinction	 between	 them.	 In	 his	 (1915b)	 later
views	 an	 instinct	 can	 never	 become	 an	 object	 of
consciousness;	 only	 the	 idea	 (Vorstellung)	 that
represents	 the	 instinct	 can	 become	 conscious.
Even	 in	 the	 unconscious	 an	 instinct	 cannot	 be
represented	 by	 other	 than	 an	 idea:	 “When	 we
nevertheless	 speak	 of	 an	 unconscious	 instinctual
impulse	or	of	a	repressed	instinctual	impulse	…	we
can	 only	 mean	 an	 instinctual	 impulse	 the
ideational	representative	of	which	is	unconscious”
(p.	177).
The	 differentiation	 between	 an	 instinct	 (in
Freud’s	 sense	 of	 the	 word)	 and	 its	 ideational
representative	in	the	psyche	contains	within	it	the
unresolved	 problem	 of	 the	 relationship	 between
brain	and	mind.	The	most	helpful	suggestion	to	the
reader	 is	 to	 remember	 that	 Freud	 conceives	 of
instinct	in	a	looser	and	less	precise	manner	than	is
denoted	 by	 the	 current	 dictionary	 term,	 which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
601
implies	 an	 inherited	 behavioral	 trait	 or	 pattern,
especially	 of	 animals.	 Jones	 (1955)	 explains	 that
other	 words,	 such	 as	 “urge,”	 “impulsion,”	 or	 the
American	expression	“drive,”	have	been	suggested
as	 translations,	 but	 he	 regards	 none	 of	 them	 as
entirely	satisfactory.	Some	contemporary	authors
wish	 to	 completely	 do	 away	 with	 the	 instinct
portion	 of	 Freud’s	 contribution,	 claiming	 it	 is
inconsistent	 with	 modern	 biology.	 Numerous
substitutions	have	been	suggested,	but	none	have
found	general	acceptance.
This	 vagueness	 in	 one	 of	 the	 fundamental
concepts	 of	 Freud’s	 psychodynamics	 has	 been
unfairly	 used	 to	 criticize	 the	 whole	 scientific
foundation	of	the	psychoanalytic	approach.	Freud
(1915a)	 himself	 anticipated	 and	 answered	 this
criticism	 in	 the	 opening	 paragraph	 of	 “Instincts
and	 Their	 Vicissitudes,”	 which	 contains	 one	 of
Freud’s	 basic	 statements	 on	 the	 philosophy	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
602
science	and	reminds	us	that	no	science,	not	even
the	 most	 exact,	 begins	 with	 entirely	 clear	 and
sharply	defined	basic	concepts:
The	 true	 beginning	 of	 scientific	 activity
consists	rather	in	describing	phenomena	and
then	 in	 proceeding	 to	 group,	 classify	 and
correlate	 them.	 Even	 at	 the	 stage	 of
description	 it	 is	 not	 possible	 to	 avoid
applying	 certain	 abstract	 ideas	 to	 the
material	 in	 hand,	 ideas	 derived	 from
somewhere	or	other,	but	certainly	not	from
the	 new	 observations	 alone.	 Such	 ideas—
which	will	later	become	the	basic	concepts	of
the	science—are	still	more	indispensable	as
the	material	is	further	worked	over,	[p.	117]
Freud	(1915a)	maintains	that	these	ideas	must
necessarily	possess	some	degree	of	indefiniteness,
and	 strictly	 speaking	 they	 are	 in	 the	 nature	 of
conventions,	 “although	 everything	 depends	 on
their	not	being	arbitrarily	chosen	but	determined
by	 having	 significant	 relations	 to	 the	 empirical
material,	 relations	 that	 we	 seem	 to	 sense	 before
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
603
we	can	clearly	recognize	and	demonstrate	them”
(p.	 117).	 After	 thorough	 investigation	 and
observation	in	the	field,	we	formulate	these	basic
scientific	 concepts	 with	 increased	 precision	 and
progressively	 modify	 them,	 yet	 they	 still	 remain
basic	postulates.
One	 such	 postulate	 is	 that	 of	 instinct.	 Freud
(1915a)	 goes	 on	 to	 delineate	 the	 concept	 more
clearly,	 first	 separating	 it	 from	 a	 stimulus	 that
represents	a	single	impact	that	can	be	disposed	of
by	 a	 single	 expedient	 action	 (e.g.,	 flight	 from	 the
source	of	stimulation).	Thus	instinct	does	not	arise
from	 the	 external	 world	 but	 from	 within	 the
organism	itself,	and	it	operates	as	a	constant	force
rather	 than	 as	 a	 momentary	 impact.	 “Moreover,
since	it	impinges	not	from	without	but	from	within
the	 organism,	 no	 flight	 can	 avail	 against	 it”	 (p.
118).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
604
We	cannot	actually	tell	what	an	instinct	is;	we
can	only	define	it	operationally.	Freud’s	definition
rests	on	the	principle	of	constancy,	which	he	calls
a	 biological	 postulate	 and	 describes	 thus:	 “The
nervous	 system	 is	 an	 apparatus	 which	 has	 the
function	of	getting	rid	of	the	stimuli	that	reach	it,
or	of	reducing	them	to	the	lowest	possible	level;	or
which,	if	it	were	feasible,	would	maintain	itself	in
an	 altogether	 unstimulated	 condition”	 (p.	 120).
This	postulate	as	a	mode	of	mental	functioning	is
quite	contrary	to	the	findings	of	Piaget	and	many
recent	 investigators	 (Lichtenberg	 1983,	 Stern
1985),	which	imply	that	the	mental	functions	even
in	 the	 most	 primitive	 state	 seek	 out	 stimulation
and	thrive	on	mastery	if	the	stimulation	is	not	too
overwhelming.	It	is	clear	that	the	notion	of	instinct
as	 an	 explanatory	 casual	 hypothesis	 is	 highly
controversial	 and	 fraught	 with	 philosophical
difficulties;	perhaps	it	is	easier	now	to	understand
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
605
why	Freud	revised	his	instinct	theory	four	times.
Although	 most	 psychoanalysts	 find	 Freud’s
final	
version	
of	
the	
theory	
of	
instincts
unsatisfactory,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 have	 a	 working
knowledge	 of	 his	 notion	 of	 instinct	 and	 his	 four
theories	 in	 order	 to	 avoid	 becoming	 confused	 in
reading	
his	
works.	
For	
a	
thorough
metapsychological	review	of	the	whole	topic,	see
Compton	(1983a,b).
One	of	the	earliest	ways	in	which	the	organism
distinguishes	between	the	inner	and	outer	world
is	through	the	discovery	that	muscular	action	can
avoid	certain	noxious	stimuli;	one	can	take	flight
from	the	outer	world	but	not	from	the	inner	world.
The	formation	of	the	ego	and	the	mechanisms	of
defense	is	given	its	primary	impetus	by	the	need
to	 develop	 protection	 against	 the	 constant
instinctual	forces	from	the	inner	world	that	cannot
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
606
be	avoided	by	the	muscular	action	of	flight.	Freud
(1915a)	 sees	 an	 instinct	 as	 the	 “psychical
representative	 of	 the	 stimuli	 originating	 from
within	the	organism	and	reaching	the	mind,	as	a
measure	of	the	demand	made	upon	the	mind	for
work	 in	 consequence	 of	 its	 connection	 with	 the
body”	(p.	122).	Each	instinct	is	characterized	by	a
pressure	(Drang),	which	is	a	measure	of	force	or
the	 demand	 for	 work	 and	 represents	 the	 “very
essence”	of	an	instinct.	The	aim	(Zeil)	of	an	instinct
is	 “in	 every	 instance	 satisfaction,	 which	 can	 only
be	obtained	by	removing	the	state	of	stimulation
at	the	source	of	the	instinct”	(p.	122).	The	object
(Objekt)	 of	 an	 instinct	 is	 the	 thing	 in	 regard	 to
which	 or	 through	 which	 the	 instinct	 is	 able	 to
achieve	its	aim;	the	source	(Quelle)	of	an	instinct
lies	in	the	somatic-chemical	or	mechanical	aspects
of	the	body.	Freud	(1915a)	claims	that	the	study	of
the	 sources	 of	 instincts	 lies	 outside	 the	 scope	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
607
psychology:	“In	mental	life	we	know	them	only	by
their	aims”	(p.	123).
The	difficulties	multiply	with	Freud’s	question,
“What	instincts	should	we	suppose	that	there	are,
and	 how	 many?”	 (p.	 123).	 It	 is	 well	 known	 that
Freud	had	a	compelling	need	to	keep	the	instincts
divided	into	two	homogenous	groups.	The	original
grouping	was	between	the	sexual	instincts	and	the
ego-preservative	
instincts,	
with	
very	
little
attention	paid	to	the	latter	since	Freud	at	the	time
was	so	busy	dipping	into	the	id	and	uncovering	the
infantile	sexual	wishes.	In	1905,	in	Three	Essays	on
the	 Theory	 of	 Sexuality,	 the	 libido	 was	 first
explicitly	 established	 as	 an	 expression	 of	 the
sexual	 instinct;	 in	 a	 short	 paper	 on	 psychogenic
disturbances	 of	 vision,	 Freud	 (1910)	 introduced
the	term	“ego	instincts,”	which	he	considered	self-
preserving.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
608
In	 “On	 Narcissism”	 (1914),	 this	 duality	 broke
down	 when	 the	 notion	 of	 ego-libido	 was
introduced	 as	 a	 natural	 stage	 of	 development
called	 primary	 narcissism.	 It	 then	 became
necessary	 to	 distinguish	 between	 originally
nonlibidinal	 ego	 instincts	 and	 libidinal	 ego
instincts.	 Sexual	 energies	 flowing	 within	 the	 ego
made	 it	 impossible	 to	 separate	 sexual	 and	 ego
instincts;	 the	 “alibidinous”	 part	 remained	 poorly
defined	and	not	in	balance	with	the	libidinal	ego
instincts.	 The	 great	 danger	 at	 this	 point	 was	 in
falling	 into	 Jung’s	 solution	 of	 using	 libido	 to
represent	 all	 instincts,	 a	 monistic	 theory	 that
rendered	the	whole	concept	of	instincts	and	libido
meaningless.
A	third	and	transitional	theory	of	the	instincts
was	 suggested	 indirectly	 in	 the	 paper	 “Instincts
and	 Their	 Vicissitudes”	 (1915a).	 Although	 the
division	between	ego	instincts	and	sexual	instincts
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
609
is	 preserved,	 a	 consideration	 of	 the	 relations
between	love	and	hate	led	Freud	to	the	conclusion
that	 hate	 was	 to	 be	 regarded	 as	 a	 nonlibidinal
reaction	of	the	ego.	This	implies	that	the	important
aspect	 of	 the	 nonlibidinal	 ego	 instincts	 is	 the
aggressive	or	sadistic	aspect.	Freud	suggests	two
kinds	 of	 sadism:	 (a)	 moral	 sadism,	 the	 drive	 for
power	or	the	control	of	the	environment	for	self-
preservation;	 and	 (b)	 sexual	 sadism,	 which
appears	in	certain	perversions	and	frustrations	of
the	 sexual	 instinct.	 Freud	 maintains	 that	 the
impulses	to	assert,	control,	and	aggress	upon	can
be	 separated	 from	 libidinal	 impulses,	 but	 the
argument	 is	 not	 convincing	 since	 if	 sadism	 is
found	 at	 every	 level	 of	 sexual	 development,	 why
can	 it	 not	 be	 considered	 a	 part	 of	 the	 libidinal
instincts?	 In	 this	 theory	 sadism	 is	 considered
partly	sexual	and	partly	nonsexual	aggressiveness,
with	the	nonsexual	aggressive	strivings	for	power
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
610
and	so	on	representing	the	nonlibidinal	part	of	the
instincts.
In	the	final	theory	of	the	instincts,	as	described
in	 Beyond	 the	 Pleasure	 Principle	 (1920),	 Freud
elevates	aggressiveness	to	an	independent	status
of	its	own	and	abandons	the	notion	of	ego	instincts
entirely.	 Aggression	 becomes	 a	 vicissitude	 of
primary	 masochism.	 The	 instincts	 are	 finally
divided	into	Eros,	the	libidinal	or	sexual	instinct,
and	 the	 death	 instinct—representing	 a	 tendency
to	disorganization	and	an	expression	of	the	inertia
of	 living	 matter,	 of	 the	 organic	 to	 become
inorganic,	 dead,	 inanimate.	 As	 libido	 represents
the	energy	of	the	sexual	instincts,	so	“destrudo”	or
“mortido”	 represents	 the	 energy	 of	 the	 death
instincts	(terms	added	by	Freud’s	followers).	This
postulation	 of	 a	 primary	 death	 instinct	 is	 not
generally	 accepted	 today,	 but	 it	 must	 be	 pointed
out	 that	 no	 better	 formulation	 has	 been	 offered
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
611
(see	DEATH	INSTINCT).
To	claim	that	outwardly	directed	aggression	is
the	primary	instinct	parallel	or	polar	opposite	to
the	 sexual	 instincts	 forces	 one	 to	 postulate	 that
man	
has	
an	
innate	
powerful,	
destructive,
aggressive	 drive.	 Such	 a	 postulate	 leads	 to	 the
confusing	 question	 of	 why,	 since	 aggression	 is	 a
component	of	all	sexual	stages	of	development,	a
separate	aggressive	instinct	at	a	polar	opposite	to
the	 sexual	 instincts	 should	 be	 postulated.	 Either
the	
libidinal	
and	
aggressive	
instinctual
phenomena	start	from	something	that	is	common
to	 both	 and	 only	 become	 differentiated	 in	 the
course	 of	 development,	 or	 each	 has	 a	 different
origin	 and	 follows	 separate	 though	 at	 times
intersecting	 lines	 of	 development.	 The	 first	 of
these	 views	 is	 a	 monistic	 one	 like	 that	 of	 Jung;
Freud	tried	to	sidestep	this	view	by	separating	out
the	 aggressive	 aspect	 of	 the	 ego-preservative
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
612
functions	from	the	problem	of	erotic	sadism.	The
final	step	was	to	remove	aggressiveness	from	the
ego	instincts	and	give	it	an	independent	status	as
an	instinctual	group	with	an	aim	of	its	own.	The
ego	is	now	thought	of	as	being	obliged	to	struggle
with	 aggressiveness	 exactly	 as	 it	 is	 obliged	 to
struggle	 with	 libido;	 it	 could	 give	 way	 to	 it,
sublimate,	 repress,	 develop	 reaction	 formations,
neutralize	it	by	adding	libidinal	elements,	or	direct
the	 aggression	 onto	 itself.	 The	 logic	 of	 the
hypothesis	seemed	to	force	Freud	to	postulate	the
death	 instinct.	 If	 the	 libido	 is	 the	 energy	 of	 the
sexual	 instincts	 and	 is	 primarily	 and	 originally
directed	upon	the	self,	we	must	similarly	postulate
that	 the	 energy	 of	 the	 aggressive	 instincts	 was
originally	 directed	 upon	 the	 self—	 the	 stage	 of
primary	masochism.
In	Freud’s	view,	the	vicissitudes	of	an	instinct
have	 a	 defensive	 connotation.	 These	 vicissitudes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
613
are:	 (1)	 reversal	 into	 its	 opposite,	 which	 can
involve	either	a	change	from	active	to	passive	aim
or	a	reversal	of	the	content	of	the	instinct;	(2)	a
turning	 around	 upon	 the	 subject;	 (3)	 repression;
and	(4)	sublimation,	which	Freud	later	says	is	not
a	vicissitude	but	a	way	of	healthy	discharge.	These
tendencies	 are	 all	 opposed	 to	 the	 instinctual
pressure	for	explosive	straightforward	discharge,
regardless	of	reality.
In	a	turning	around	upon	the	subject,	the	first
and	second	vicissitudes	coincide	in	that	both	the
aim	 and	 the	 object	 of	 the	 instinct	 sometimes
change.	For	example,	the	wish	to	exercise	violence
or	 inflict	 pain	 on	 another	 person	 proceeds	 to	 a
change	of	object	to	the	self;	this	may	also	change
the	aim	of	the	instinct	from	active	to	passive,	and
so	the	self	is	substituted	as	an	object	to	take	over
the	role	of	the	other	person.	This	is	the	situation	of
masochism	(see	MASOCHISM);	thus	sadism	always
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
614
precedes	 masochism	 in	 the	 third	 instinct	 theory
(see	 above).	 In	 reversal	 into	 the	 opposite,	 the
active	 aim	 to	 look	 at	 or	 torture,	 for	 example,	 is
changed	into	the	passive	aim	to	be	looked	at	and
to	be	tortured,	and	this	usually	involves	a	turning
around	on	the	subject.
Freud’s	 discussion	 of	 love	 and	 hate	 prepares
the	 way	 for	 the	 final	 instinct	 theory.	 There	 is	 no
polarity	between	love	and	hate,	for	love	is	not	an
instinct;	according	to	Freud,	it	is	an	elaboration	of
the	sexual	instinct,	whereas	hate	is	an	instinct	and
a	primal	emotion.	For	Freud,	love	is	a	higher-order
reaction	 resulting	 from	 sexual	 satisfaction.	 Thus
speaking	 of	 a	 reversal	 from	 love	 to	 hate	 is	 not	 a
description	of	the	vicissitude	of	an	instinct.	Freud
(1915a)	 explains,	 “The	 case	 of	 love	 and	 hate
requires	a	special	interest	from	the	circumstance
that	love	refuses	to	be	fitted	into	our	scheme	of	the
instincts”	 (p.	 133).	 He	 insists	 that	 love	 and	 hate
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
615
“spring	 from	 different	 sources,	 and	 had	 each	 its
own	 development	 before	 the	 influence	 of	 the
pleasure-unpleasure	 relation	 made	 them	 into
opposite”	(p.	138).	Hate	at	this	point	is	conceived
as	springing	from	the	aggressive	component	of	the
nonlibidinal	 ego	 instincts.	 Thus	 sadism	 is	 the
aggression	of	the	ego	instincts	with	vicissitudes	of
its	own,	although	there	is	also	a	sexual	sadism.	The
sadism	 of	 the	 ego	 instincts	 is	 a	 will	 to	 power	 or
dominance.	According	to	Freud,	when	the	will	to
cruelty	or	torture	is	added,	we	have	the	infusion	of
the	sadism	of	the	ego	instincts	with	sexual	sadism.
This	 distinction	 between	 sexual	 sadism	 as	 a
part	 of	 the	 libidinal	 instincts	 and	 hate	 or	 moral
sadism	as	a	vital	component	of	the	ego	instincts	is
unsatisfactory	 and	 demanded	 revision,	 as	 Freud
obviously	understood.	It	is	fascinating	to	see	how
Freud	 reached	 his	 final	 revision	 of	 the	 instinct
theory	 and	 to	 study	 the	 various	 aspects	 of	 his
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
616
personal	 and	 intellectual	 life	 that	 were	 at	 play
when	he	created	the	polarity	of	the	life	and	death
instincts.
Why	 can	 we	 not	 postulate	 the	 two	 primary
groups	of	instincts	as	libidinal	and	aggressive?	The
answer,	 as	 we	 have	 seen,	 is	 because	 we	 also
postulate	 that	 the	 primary	 state	 of	 the	 organism
involves	 these	 instincts	 infusing	 the	 self.	 So,	 in
primary	narcissism,	the	original	investment	of	the
libido	 is	 on	 the	 self.	 To	 be	 consistent	 we	 would
have	to	postulate	a	primary	masochism	in	which
the	original	investment	of	the	aggression	was	also
on	 the	 self.	 One	 cannot	 logically	 avoid	 the
consequences	of	Freud’s	final	revision	of	instinct
theory—like	 Freud,	 we	 are	 forced	 to	 accept	 this
revision	
by	
the	
logic	
of	
our	
theoretical
formulations.	The	only	way	to	avoid	this	situation
is	 to	 throw	 out	 his	 theory	 of	 instincts	 entirely.
Compton	 (1983a)	 demonstrates	 that	 when	 one
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
617
moves	 to	 structural	 theory,	 there	 is	 much
confusion	 in	 the	 use	 of	 drives,	 regulatory
principles,	and	objects.	He	claims	that	the	concept
of	narcissistic	libido	is	untenable.

INTELLECTUALIZATION,
ISOLATION
Isolation	represents	a	mechanism	of	defense	in
which	affect	and	idea	are	separated.	In	the	typical
clinical	 situation,	 the	 affect	 may	 appear	 with	 no
ideation	 attached	 to	 it,	 or	 the	 idea	 may	 appear
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
619
with	no	affect	that	one	would	expect	attached	to	it.
Intellectualization	represents	the	concentration	on
abstract	 and	 speculative	 ideas.	 It	 becomes	 a
defense	when,	as	in	adolescence,	it	is	used	to	exert
control	 over	 anxiety	 and	 reduce	 tension.	 The
abstract	 discussions	 and	 “little	 groups	 of	 serious
thinkers”	 that	 characterize	 college	 dormitories
utilize	intellectualization	and	isolation	as	ways	of
dealing	 with	 the	 tensions	 that	 are	 produced	 by
physical	 proximity	 and	 the	 upsurges	 of	 the
hormones	during	adolescence.
Although	
there	
has	
been	
considerable
attention	 paid	 to	 the	 appearance	 of	 isolation	 in
clinical	 material,	 not	 enough	 attention	 is	 paid	 to
intellectualization.	This	is	a	special	problem	if	one
has	a	practice	in	a	university	community,	or	where
other	 mental	 health	 practitioners	 are	 one’s
patients.	The	tendency	for	educated	individuals	to
use	defensive	intellectualization	must	be	watched
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
620
for	 constantly,	 and	 the	 defensive	 use	 by	 one’s
patients	who	are	mental	health	practitioners	of	all
sorts	of	theories	and	speculations	must	be	noted
and	 interpreted	 properly.	 Nothing	 is	 more
destructive	to	an	uncovering	psychotherapy	than
getting	 involved	 in	 intellectual,	 abstract,	 or
theoretical	discussions	with	patients.	These	kinds
of	
interventions	
are	
invariably
countertransference	unless	they	are	done	for	the
very	 specific	 purpose	 of	 supportive	 therapy.	 The
pitfall	 in	 the	 practice	 of	 psychotherapy	 is	 to	 be
seduced	
by	
the	
patient’s	
intelligence	
or
intimidated	by	the	patient’s	superior	knowledge	of
psychiatric	 or	 psychological	 theory,	 a	 knowledge
that	is	useless	when	one	is	a	patient.	The	gravest
problem	with	intellectualization	is	that	it	produces
an	 unemotional	 atmosphere	 and	 hides	 the	 real
affects	and	important	aspects	of	the	transference.
In	 my	 supervisory	 experience,	 insufficiently
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
621
analyzed	 therapists	 are	 especially	 prone	 to
becoming	 involved	 in	 intellectualization	 with
patients	 as	 a	 form	 of	 countertransference	 or	 to
being	
unaware	
that	
a	
patient	
is	
using
intellectualization	as	a	principal	means	of	defense.
The	reason	this	is	so	seductive	is	that	it	produces	a
very	 pleasant	 and	 academic	 ambience	 in	 the
therapy	hour,	allowing	tension	reduction	in	both
parties.
INTERPRETATION,
LISTENING
(see	also	LISTENING)
The	 goal	 of	 an	 interpretation	 is	 to	 help	 the
patient	become	consciously	aware	of	the	meaning
of	 some	 element	 in	 his	 or	 her	 mental	 life.	 This
involves	the	patient’s	recognizing	mental	contents
that	 were	 previously	 unconscious	 and	 defended
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
622
against.	 Interpretation	 therefore	 acts	 as	 a	 tool
chiefly	 in	 an	 insight-directed	 treatment;	 it	 is	 less
commonly	 used	 in	 supportive	 treatment.	 Only
some	 of	 the	 highlights	 of	 the	 technique	 of
interpretation	can	be	brought	out	here.	It	is	both	a
skill	and	a	delicate	art	that	develops	gradually	as
the	therapist’s	self-knowledge,	clinical	experience,
and	maturity	increase.
Every	
other	
procedure	
prepares	
for
interpretation,	 amplifies	 the	 interpretation,	 or
makes	
an	
interpretation	
effective	
(see
INTERVENTIONS).	 To	 interpret	 is	 to	 make
unconscious	 or	 preconscious	 psychic	 content
conscious,	 to	 give	 it	 meaning	 and	 causality.	 The
reasonable	 and	 conscious	 ego	 is	 made	 aware	 of
something	 to	 which	 it	 had	 been	 oblivious.	 This
usually	requires	more	than	a	single	intervention;
hence,	 the	 need	 for	 working	 through	 (see
WORKING	THROUGH).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
623
The	 therapist	 must	 use	 his	 or	 her	 own
conscious	 mind,	 empathy,	 intuition,	 and	 fantasy
life,	 as	 well	 as	 intellectual	 and	 theoretical
knowledge,	 to	 arrive	 at	 an	 interpretation.	 By
interpreting	 the	 therapist	 goes	 beyond	 what	 is
understandable	 and	 observable	 by	 ordinary
conscious	 and	 logical	 thinking.	 The	 patient’s
responses	are	necessary	to	determine	whether	the
interpretation	is	valid	or	not.
All	 successful	 interpretation	 is	 based	 on
adequate	listening.	If	one	cannot	listen,	one	cannot
possibly	arrive	at	correct	interpretations.	Dewald
(1964)	approaches	this	subject	by	discussing	the
therapist’s	 activity	 in	 listening,	 which	 is	 a	 good
deal	more	than	a	passive	recording	of	the	material
verbalized	by	the	patient.	The	therapist	takes	note
of	 the	 pattern	 and	 the	 sequence	 of	 the	 material
presented,	 the	 “temporal	 juxtaposition”	 of	 the
material,	 what	 material	 has	 been	 omitted	 by	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
624
patient	 and	 tries	 to	 observe	 his	 or	 her	 own
personal	 reactions	 to	 the	 patient	 and	 to	 the
patient’s	 material.	 The	 therapist	 uses	 himself	 or
herself	 as	 an	 exploring	 instrument,	 on	 the	 basis
that	personal	reactions	to	the	patient	may	indicate
some	 of	 the	 effects	 that	 the	 patient	 produces	 in
other	people	with	whom	he	or	she	interacts.	This
gives	 the	 therapist	 a	 better	 understanding	 of	 the
patient’s	
interrelationship	
to	
his	
or	
her
environment	outside	the	treatment.
In	 many	 ways	 the	 therapist	 has	 to	 use	 his	 or
her	 self	 as	 a	 stethoscope.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 the
therapist	 must	 adopt	 an	 attitude	 of	 evenly
suspended	attention	(Freud	1912),	in	which	he	or
she	 does	 not	 limit	 the	 self	 to	 specific	 ideas,
thoughts,	 or	 feelings	 produced	 by	 the	 patient	 at
that	particular	moment	but	rather	attempts	to	let
thoughts	 and	 associations	 range	 freely	 over	 the
material.	As	the	therapist	listens	and	observes,	he
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
625
or	 she	 may	 be	 reminded	 at	 times	 of	 similar
phenomena—general	
patterns	
or	
particular
instances	of	human	behavior	and	experience.	This
may	enable	the	therapist	to	bring	in	new	ideas	and
new	understanding	of	the	material	that	would	not
be	noted	if	he	or	she	had	adhered	to	rigid	listening
and	recording	of	the	exact	data	from	the	patient.
It	follows	that	the	skilled	therapist	must	have	a
superior	 capacity	 to	 listen.	 A	 certain	 lack	 of
rigidity,	 a	 sensitivity,	 and	 an	 empathy	 with	 the
patient	 as	 he	 or	 she	 presents	 thoughts	 and
describes	 experiences	 are	 necessary.	 In	 addition,
empathy	involves	the	therapist	in	making	a	partial
and	 transient	 identification	 with	 the	 patient,
putting	himself	or	herself	into	the	patient’s	shoes.
If	the	therapist	does	not	have	the	capacity	to	listen
with	 evenly	 suspended	 attention	 or	 empathize
with	 the	 patient	 (or,	 in	 more	 technical	 terms,	 to
regress	 in	 the	 service	 of	 the	 ego	 and	 oscillate
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
626
between	 such	 a	 regression	 and	 the	 secondary-
process	 capacities	 of	 putting	 the	 information
received	 in	 this	 regression	 into	 terminology	 that
can	 then	 be	 expressed	 to	 the	 patient),	 the
therapist	will	fail.
The	 material	 presented	 by	 the	
patient
produces	
in	
the	
therapist	
an	
empathic
identification	
and	
understanding	
through
resonance	 after	 evenly	 suspended	 attention.
Considerable	 debate	 remains	 in	 the	 literature
regarding	the	emphasis	on	empathy	by	Kohut	and
his	followers	(see	EMPATHY).	Balter	and	Spencer
(1991)	 insist	 that	 Kohut’s	 use	 of	 empathy	 and
introspection	represents	a	fundamental	change	in
listening	 stance	 from	 that	 of	 Freud’s	 free
association	and	evenly	suspended	attention.	This
would,	 they	 claim,	 inevitably	 lead	 to	 a	 different
theory	and	approach.	Each	psychotherapist	must
ponder	this	unresolved	issue.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
627
The	 therapist	 needs	 to	 rationally	 understand
and	organize	the	material	in	a	way	that	makes	it
comprehensible	to	the	patient.	The	therapist	must
also	 decide	 how	 and	 when	 to	 present	 what	 has
been	understood	to	the	patient.	For	example,	if	the
therapeutic	 session	 is	 almost	 over,	 it	 may	 be
tactically	wiser	to	wait	for	another	time,	since	the
end	of	a	session	is	not	the	best	time	to	present	the
patient	with	new	ideas.
Another	 way	 of	 approaching	 the	 problem	 of
the	taxing	and	difficult	procedure	of	listening	is	to
attempt	 to	 set	 out	 a	 series	 of	 rules	 that	 the
therapist	 can	 use	 to	 help	 in	 understanding
unconscious	material.	Saul	(1958)	gives	a	series	of
rules	that	I	have	found	useful	in	my	own	clinical
work	and	teaching.	To	paraphrase:
1.	Keep	close	to	the	material;	do	not	introduce
your	own	associations;	do	not	swing	wide
and	 far	 away	 from	 the	 material	 in	 your
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
628
ideas	about	it.
2.	Look	for	the	major	themes	first,	rather	than
the	subsidiary	themes	and	details.
3.	 Keep	 to	 the	 level	 of	 consciousness	 of	 the
material.	 Do	 not	 mix	 levels.	 This	 is
extremely	
important	
in	
the	
art	
of
interpretation.	If	a	patient	is	dealing	with
material	in	the	area	of	resistance,	it	is	very
important	 to	 keep	 interpretation	 in	 the
area	 of	 resistance	 and	 not	 interpret
content	when	the	patient	is	not	ready	for
it.	 Or,	 if	 the	 patient	 is	 presenting	 deep,
pregenital,	unconscious	material	in	sexual-
genital	 form,	 it	 is	 important	 not	 to	 make
probing	 interpretations	 of	 the	 pregenital
material	before	the	patient	is	ready	for	it.
This	is	a	common	example	of	wild	analysis
(see	 WILD	 ANALYSIS)	 and	 is	 a	 grave
mistake	 because	 it	 simply	 mobilizes
defenses.
4.	Distinguish	dynamics	from	content.	No	matter
how	
unintelligible	
associations	
and
dreams	 may	 be,	 at	 least	 the	 main	 topics
and	tendencies,	the	emotional	forces,	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
629
something	 of	 their	 interplay	 are	 usually
discernible.	 If	 the	 therapist	 finds	 himself
or	herself	throughout	even	a	single	session
totally	 lost	 and	 with	 no	 understanding	 of
the	material	at	all,	there	may	be	a	problem
with	
a	
lack	
of	
training	
or	
a
countertransference	problem,	or	both.	The
only	
solution	
is	
self-analysis	
and
consultation.	 For	 a	 therapist	 of	 any
integrity,	 this	 will	 come	 as	 a	 command,
self-instigated.	In	general,	there	are	far	too
few	consultations.	Many	disasters	could	be
avoided	by	this	simple	device.
5.	Keep	separate	what	is	current	in	the	present
life	 situation	 from	 the	 transference	 and
from	the	past	or	childhood.
6.	 Be	 alert	 to	 the	 effects	 on	 the	 material	 of
current	stimuli	in	the	patient’s	life	and	also
from	 the	 transference.	 In	 psychotherapy
one	 always	 has	 to	 keep	 a	 sharp	 eye	 on
what	is	going	on	in	the	reality	situation	of
the	patient	at	any	given	time.	Ignoring	the
reality	 situation	 soon	 makes	 of	 therapy	 a
sterile	 intellectual	 process	 that	 gets
nowhere	and	usually	causes	the	patient	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
630
feel	
rejected	
and,	
correctly,
misunderstood.
7.	 Review	 the	 material	 both	 in	 terms	 of	 the
libidinal	 motivations	 directed	 toward	 self
and	 others	 and	 the	 hostile	 motivations.
Look	for	manifestations	of	fight	and	flight.
Try	to	understand	material	in	terms	of	the
ego,	
id,	
and	
superego	
rather	
than
emphasize	 any	 one	 of	 these	 realms	 of
mental	 functioning.	 All	 material	 contains
ego	 motivations	 and	 sexual	 as	 well	 as
aggressive	motivations.
8.	 Pay	 close	 attention	 to	 the	 sequence	 of
associations	 and	 dream	 elements.	 The
beginning	of	the	hour	often	expresses	the
theme	of	the	session;	the	end	of	a	dream
represents	 solutions,	 or	 lack	 of	 them,	 to
conflicts.
9.	Watch	for	those	associations	connected	with
the	 greatest	 emotional	 response.	 One	 of
the	ways	to	avoid	getting	bogged	down	in
a	
great	
deal	
of	
apparently
incomprehensible	
material	
is	
to
concentrate	on	those	areas	that	seem	to	be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
631
associated	with	the	most	feeling	and	those
that	seem	to	be	associated	with	the	least.
Sometimes	
the	
patient	
isolates	
the
material	from	the	affect,	and	material	that
seems	 to	 be	 presented	 in	 the	 coldest
manner	 can	 be	 the	 most	 important	 (see
INTELLECTUALIZATION,	ISOLATION).
10.	 Look	 for	 the	 positive	 progressive	 forces	 in
the	patient,	as	well	as	the	regressive	ones.
In	
an	
eagerness	
to	
understand
unconscious	 material,	 the	 therapist	 may
forget	 that	 the	 patient	 is	 changing	 and
improving.	 The	 patient	 has	 a	 progressive
force	 toward	 health,	 which	 can	 be
influencing	the	material.
11.	 Study	 the	 interpersonal	 relations	 of	 the
patient	 for	 his	 or	 her	 object	 relations—
persons	 whom	 he	 or	 she	 loves,	 hates,	 is
dependent	
on,	
and	
so	
forth—for
identifications	and	projections.
12.	Finally,	be	very	cautious	about	interpreting
symbols,	slips,	errors,	and	so	forth	on	an	ex
cathedra	basis.	Look	for	what	the	patient
accepts	and	acts	upon	in	the	material.	Saul
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
632
(1958)	 calls	 this	 “a	 prognostic	 guide”	 to
what	 the	 person	 is	 really	 capable	 of
accepting	and	acting	on	in	real	life.	One	of
the	 most	 common	 beginner’s	 errors	 is	 to
attempt	 to	 impress	 the	 patient	 with	 wild
analysis.	 This	 almost	 invariably	 has	 a
paradoxical	 effect,	 and	 represents	 a
countertransference	problem.
Alexander	 (1956)	 points	 out	 that	 in	 analytic
therapy	 our	 main	 allies	 are	 the	 striving	 of
unconscious	 forces	 for	 expression	 and	 the
integrating	 tendency	 of	 the	 conscious	 ego.
Alexander	 maintains	 that	 even	 if	 we	 do	 nothing
else	 but	 not	 interfere	 with	 these	 two	 forces,	 we
will	be	able	to	help	many	patients.	He	continues,
Interpretations	which	connect	the	actual	life
situation	with	past	experiences	and	with	the
transference	 situation—	 since	 the	 latter	 is
always	
the	
axis	
around	
which	
such
connections	 can	 best	 be	 made—are	 called
total	
interpretations.	
The	
more	
that
interpretations	approximate	this	principle	of
totality,	 the	 more	 they	 fulfill	 their	 double
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
633
purpose:	they	accelerate	the	assimilation	of
new	material	by	the	ego	and	mobilize	further
unconscious	material,	[p.	68]
Certain	 factors	 can	 be	 kept	 in	 mind	 that	 will
help	in	developing	the	art	of	interpretation.	First,
the	 patient	 must	 be	 ready	 to	 receive	 an
interpretation,	and	there	must	be	preparation	for
interpretation	
by	
the	
understanding	
of
unconscious	material.	Then,	interpretation	should
be	as	total	as	possible,	and	it	should	refer	to	major
emotional	 forces	 and	 not	 bog	 down	 in	 too	 many
intricate	masses	of	detail.	Interpretation	should	be
realistic	 and	 in	 the	 clear,	 simple,	 and	 everyday
language	of	the	patient.	It	should	never	be	wild.	It
should	be	presented	in	a	matter-of-fact	way,	in	a
friendly	 and	 practical	 manner,	 and	 should	 be
brought	out	almost	casually	so	that	the	patient	can
accept	and	think	about	it	without	feeling	put	upon
or	forced	to	accept	it.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
634
Correct	interpretations	obviously	also	help	the
therapeutic	alliance.	They	demonstrate	an	ability
on	 the	 therapist’s	 part	 to	 understand	 accurately
the	
patient’s	
unconscious	
and	
the	
central
emotional	 forces	 in	 the	 material	 at	 hand.	 The
correct	interpretation	is	based	on	a	great	deal	of
evidence,	 focuses	 on	 main	 issues	 and	 not	 side
issues,	is	presented	in	a	nontechnical	fashion,	and
is	narrowed	down	to	the	presenting	material.	The
therapist	should	wait	until	he	or	she	has	enough
material	 and	 information	 so	 that	 the	 patient	 is
almost	 making	 the	 interpretation	 by	 himself	 or
herself.	The	only	exceptions	to	this	are	emergency
situations	where	the	therapist	feels	that	the	whole
therapy	 is	 in	 danger	 unless	 some	 form	 of
resistance	is	stopped.	The	therapist	may	then	have
to	interpret	widely	and	deeply	in	an	attempt	to	put
a	 stop	 to	 therapy-threatening	 or	 even	 life-
threatening	behavior.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
635
Glover	
(1955)	
distinguished	
between
“incomplete”	 and	 “inexact”	 interpretations.	 An
incomplete	 interpretation	 is	 simply	 a	 step	 in
technique	in	which	the	therapist	gets	the	patient
to	 move	 closer	 to	 the	 unconscious	 material,	 but
the	interpretation	is	not	total.	It	is	based	on	lack	of
sufficient	 clinical	 material	 and	 problems	 with
resistance.
An	 inexact	 interpretation	 has	 a	 different
purpose,	 although	 at	 a	 given	 moment	 it	 might
seem	to	be	the	same.	An	inexact	interpretation	is
deliberately	 offered	 as	 providing	 a	 definitive
meaning	 to	 a	 certain	 arrangement	 of	 material,	 a
meaning	 that	 in	 the	 unstated	 opinion	 of	 the
therapist	 actually	 falls	 short	 of	 the	 truth.	 The
therapist	 has	 judged	 that	 the	 complete	 truth
would	be	dangerous	or	intolerable	to	the	patient.
The	 patient	 seizes	 the	 inexact	 interpretation
eagerly,	because	it	helps	to	continue	to	repress	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
636
truth.	The	process	at	work	here	is	effectively	one
of	displacement.	It	is	fostered	by	the	therapist	to
bolster	 the	 patient’s	 defenses	 when	 uncovering
psychotherapy	is	contraindicated.
Tarachow	(1963)	notes	that	it	is	important	for
the	therapist	to	realize	the	difference	between	an
inexact	interpretation	and	a	wrong	interpretation.
An	inexact	interpretation	is	deliberately	handed	to
a	 patient	 to	 enable	 the	 patient	 to	 shore	 up	 ego
structure	and	to	maintain	stability	of	defenses.	A
wrong	 interpretation	 is	 simply	 a	 mistake	 by	 the
therapist	 that	 the	 patient	 eagerly	 jumps	 on	 to
shore	 up	 the	 forces	 of	 resistance.	 This	 will
generally	cause	some	difficulty	in	the	progress	of
the	 therapy,	 unless	 the	 therapist	 is	 alert	 to	 the
patient’s	responses	and	realizes	that	a	mistake	has
been	made.
The	 best	 test	 of	 an	 interpretation	 is	 in	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
637
response	 that	 it	 receives	 from	 a	 patient.	 If	 the
interpretation	 is	 utilized	 in	 making	 a	 psychic
change	 (e.g.,	 the	 removal	 of	 a	 resistance,	 or	 an
improved	 life	 adaptation)	 it	 is	 meaningful	 and
useful.	It	is	obvious	that	an	important	measure	of
the	 therapist’s	 success	 in	 the	 technique	 and
practice	of	psychotherapy	is	in	his	or	her	capacity
to	produce	meaningful	and	useful	interpretations.
This	 capacity	 is	 partly	 intuitive	 and	 partly
developed	by	study	and	clinical	experience.	Above
all,	it	is	enhanced	by	the	personal	integrity	of	the
therapist	
and	
genuine	
dedication	
to	
self-
understanding	and	understanding	the	patient.

INTERSUBJECTIVE	FIELD
This	 term	 was	 introduced	 by	 Brandchaft	 and
Stolorow	 (1984)	 and	 by	 Atwood	 and	 Stolorow
(1984)	 to	 refer	 to	 the	 fact	 that	 diagnosis	 and
meaning	 in	 a	 therapy	 situation	 are	 primarily	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
639
function	 of	 the	 mutual	 interchange	 between
therapist	 and	 the	 patient.	 It	 is	 a	 variant	 of	 the
hermeneutic	approach	(see	HERMENEUTICS)	and
is	 introduced	 in	 order	 to	 contrast	 it	 with	 the
classic	positivist	notion	of	the	neutral	realistic	and
relatively	
healthy	
therapist	
confronting	
the
emotionally	 disturbed	 and	 pathological	 patient
and	 making	 an	 “objective”	 diagnosis,	 a	 concept
analogous	 to	 the	 medical	 evaluation	 of	 a	 patient
with	 a	 physical	 disease.	 It	 again	 raises	 the
unresolved	 important	 issue	 of	 whether	 the
method	 in	 the	 human	 sciences	 (see	 HUMAN
SCIENCES)	can	be	adopted	from	that	used	by	the
physical	 and	 biological	 sciences	 or	 whether	 a
unique	 method,	 such	 as	 phenomenology	 (see
PHENOMENOLOGY)	must	be	used.
This	approach	carries	the	risk	of	assuming	that
diagnoses	 have	 no	 objective	 validity	 and	 are
simply	a	function	of	the	intersubjective	field.	This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
640
is	 clearly	 wrong	 since	 there	 is	 now	 suggestive
evidence	 for	 biological	 and	 constitutional	 factors
that	 go	 into	 the	 formation	 of	 psychopathology.
Brandchaft	 and	 Stolorow	 are	 well	 aware	 of	 this
and	 have	 been	 falsely	 accused	 of	 an	 untenable
position.	 Stolorow	 and	 colleagues	 (1987)	 have
developed	their	position	at	greater	length,	shown
its	 relationship	 to	 self	 psychology,	 and	 given
clinical	illustrations	of	their	approach.
An	even	more	radical	view	has	been	presented
by	 Natterson	 (1991),	 who	 proclaims	 that	 the
idiosyncratic	 subjectivity	 of	 the	 therapist	 “is	 a
basic	
motivational	
source	
and	
structuring
influence	 in	 the	 therapeutic	 process”	 (p.	 223).	 In
this	 view	 there	 must	 be	 continuous	 self-
monitoring	 by	 the	 therapist	 of	 his	 or	 her
individual	desires,	fears,	and	perspectives	brought
to	
the	
treatment	
situation,	
inevitably	
and
constantly	 exerting	 a	 shaping	 and	 constituting
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
641
influence	 on	 the	 transference	 and	 the	 treatment
process.	 This	 is	 beyond	 countertransference
because	it	is	in	addition	to	it,	since	it	is	not	stirred
up	 simply	 by	 the	 patient’s	 transference	 or
personality,	but	by	a	whole	host	of	other	factors	in
the	external	life	and	past	history	of	the	therapist.

INTERVENTIONS
(see	also	INTERPRETATION)
Some	 authors	 use	 intervention	 as	 a	 generic
term	 for	 all	 the	 analyst’s	 communications	 to	 the
patient,	 including	 instructions,	 explanations,	 and
reconstructions.	 There	 are	 four	 classical	 types	 of
interventions	 that	 take	 place	 in	 psychoanalytic
psychotherapy.	 The	 first	 three	 of	 these	 are
questions,	clarifications,	and	confrontations.
Clarification	
focuses	
on	
conscious	
and
preconscious	
mental	
processes	
and	
is	
an
intervention	that	presumes	the	patient	has	access
to	the	material,	although	he	or	she	may	not	have
expressed	 it	 or	 have	 been	 fully	 aware	 of	 it.
Confrontation	 is	 used	 to	 direct	 the	 patient’s
attention	to	something	conscious	or	preconscious
that	has	already	been	expressed	but	on	which	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
643
patient’s	 attention	 is	 not	 focused	 at	 the	 moment.
Reconstructions	 and	 explanations	 gain	 special
importance	 in	 self	 psychological	 analysis	 (Kohut
1984)	and	contain	a	certain	mode	of	gratification
(see	RECONSTRUCTION).
The	 most	 important	 and	 most	 commonly
emphasized	
intervention	
in	
psychoanalytic
psychotherapy	 is	 interpretation.	 Moore	 and	 Fine
(1990)	
define	
genetic	
interpretations	
as
connecting	 present	 material	 with	 the	 past;	 they
include	
reconstructions	
under	
genetic
interpretations.	 Dynamic	 interpretations	 clarify
current	 conflicting	 mental	 trends	 that	 result	 in
current	
behavior,	
feelings,	
and	
so	
forth.
Transference	
interpretations	
deal	
with	
the
therapeutic	 relationship	 as	 it	 is	 affected	 by	 the
transference	(see	INTERPRETATION).

J-K
JEALOUSY
How	curious	that	jealousy,	which	we	have	all
experienced	at	one	time	or	another,	is	not	defined
in	Samuel	Johnson’s	dictionary!	It	is	an	important
concept	for	psychotherapists	because	it	appears	in
a	 morbid	 form	 in	 paranoia,	 and	 also	 because	 it
must	 be	 distinguished	 in	 Kleinian	 theory	 from
envy.	The	morbid	form	of	paranoid	jealousy	is	the
delusion	 that	 the	 marital	 or	 sexual	 partner	 is
unfaithful.	 The	 classical	 example	 of	 this	 is	 in
Shakespeare’s	 Othello.	 Such	 jealousy	 may	 be
accompanied	
by	
endless	
arguments	
and
interrogations	of	the	partner	and	even	torture	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
646
violence,	 including	 homicide.	 There	 is	 a	 form	 of
chronic	 alcoholism	 associated	 with	 pathological
jealousy.	Jealousy	in	psychotic	conditions	takes	a
delusional	form.
In	classical	psychoanalytic	theory	envy,	rivalry,
and	 jealousy	 are	 not	 clearly	 differentiated	 and
there	is	an	overlap	of	jealousy	and	the	concept	of
narcissistic	 wounding.	 The	 emphasis	 in	 classical
theory	 is	 on	 the	 oedipal	 desire	 for	 exclusive
possession	of	the	parent	of	the	opposite	sex	and
the	rivalry	and	jealousy	with	the	siblings	and	the
other	parent	when	the	desired	parent	shows	any
attention	to	them.
All	 this	 is	 in	 sharp	 contrast	 to	 the	 theory	 of
Melanie	Klein	(1957),	who	introduced	the	concept
of	envy	(see	ENVY)	as	primary	and	constitutional.
At	 a	 slightly	 later	 developmental	 time	 jealousy
crystallizes	 out	 of	 this	 constitutional	 or	 primary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
647
envy.	 Primal	 envy,	 which	 contains	 the	 attack	 on
people	 with	 special	 advantages	 and	 qualities
simply	for	the	sake	of	their	goodness,	is	gradually
modulated	 to	 jealousy	 and	 greed,	 and	 then
hopefully	to	a	more	mature	state	of	competition.
According	 to	 Hinshelwood	 (1989),	 envy	 is	 a
fantasy	of	forced	entry	and	destructive	attacks	on
the	 good	 object.	 There	 may	 be	 an	 equally
omnipotent	fantasy	of	taking	the	object	in	with	a
damaging	 violence	 so	 that	 the	 object	 is	 spoiled
through	a	violent	form	of	possession	and	control.
This	 is	 defined	 as	 greed	 and	 may	 result	 in	 an
accumulation	 of	 damaged	 objects	 inside,	 “each
provoking	 a	 greater	 demand	 and	 hunger	 for	 a
good	object	to	be	taken	in	to	alleviate	the	steadily
worsening	internal	state”	(p.	171).
Jealousy	is	based	more	on	love	and	aims	at	the
possession	of	the	loved	object	and	the	removal	of
the	rival,	pertaining	to	a	triangular	relationship	at
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
648
a	
time	
of	
life	
when	
objects	
are	
clearly
differentiated	 from	 each	 other.	 Envy	 is	 more
primary,	 more	 dyadic,	 and	 involves	 the	 wish	 to
attack	and	destroy	as	a	primitive	and	fundamental
emotion	 aimed	 at	 spoiling	 the	 goodness	 of	 the
object	 in	 order	 to	 remove	 the	 source	 of	 envious
feelings.	Because	of	the	spoiling	aspects	of	envy,	it
has	 the	 least	 libidinal	 components	 and	 the
strongest	 suffusion	 with	 the	 death	 instinct	 (see
DEATH	INSTINCT);	greed	has	a	stronger	libidinal
component	 and	 is	 again	 more	 concentrated	 on
possessing	 the	 goodness	 of	 the	 object	 through
internalization.

(see	MID-LIFE	CRISIS)
KERNBERG,	OTTO
(see	SPLITTING)
KLEIN,	MELANIE
(1882-1960)
Melanie	 Klein,	 born	 in	 Vienna,	 was	 the
youngest	 of	 four	 children	 from	 the	 second
marriage	 of	 a	 Jewish	 doctor	 who	 was	 over	 50
when	she	was	born.	She	was	closer	to	her	much
younger	mother	and	became	a	humanities	student,
always	 regretting	 she	 had	 not	 studied	 medicine.
She	 married	 at	 21	 and	 had	 three	 children.	 Her
husband	 found	 work	 in	 Budapest	 and	 she	 began
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
650
analysis	 with	 Ferenczi,	 who	 encouraged	 her	 to
analyze	 children.	 In	 1921,	 after	 separating	 from
her	 husband,	 she	 moved	 to	 Berlin	 and	 began
analysis	 with	 Abraham.	 But	 14	 months	 later	 he
died	and	in	1927	she	moved	to	England.	There	she
engaged	in	a	longstanding	and	often	acrimonious
debate	with	the	followers	of	Anna	Freud,	who	did
not	 believe	 children	 could	 be	 psychoanalyzed.
Segal	(1974,	1980)	offers	the	best	overall	review
of	Klein’s	life	and	thought.	Her	work	is	collected	in
four	volumes	(Klein	1932,	1961,	1975a,	1975b);	a
recent	 review	 of	 her	 basic	 concepts	 is	 presented
by	Petot	(1990,	1991).
There	are	five	crucial	notions	in	Klein’s	system.
First,	 she	 believed	 that	 stages	 of	 the	 Oedipus
complex	 and	 superego	 formation	 exist	 in	 early
infancy,	 which	 implies	 that	 the	 infant	 has	 the
capacity	 for	 some	 very	 complex	 perceptions,
emotions,	 and	 mental	 integrations.	 Second,	 she
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
651
postulated	 that	 the	 early	 postnatal	 operation	 of
introjection	and	projection	build	the	infant’s	inner
phantasy	 world;	 introjection	 and	 projection	 are
based	 on	 dealing	 with	 the	 death	 instinct	 as	 the
initial	problem	of	life.
Third,	Klein	postulated	two	critical	“positions,”
a	 difficult	 term	 that	 is	 different	 from	 Freud’s
developmental	 phases	 (oral,	 anal,	 genital).	 The
paranoid-schizoid	position	deals	with	ambivalence
by	splitting	and	projection	and	occurs	during	the
first	three	or	four	months	of	life;	it	is	characterized
by	 persecutory	 fears	 and	 anxiety	 over	 survival.
During	 this	 position	 the	 good	 (gratifying)	 breast
produces	 a	 feeling	 of	 love	 when	 the	 infant	 is
satisfied.	This	is	projected	and	experienced	as	the
good	
breast	
loving	
the	
infant,	
who	
then
internalizes	 this	 sense	 of	 being	 loved	 as	 a
protection	against	the	death	instinct.	The	infant’s
oral	sadism	springing	from	the	death	instinct	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
652
from	the	bad	(frustrating)	breast	imagined	when
the	 infant	 is	 frustrated	 produces	 hate.	 This	 is
projected	 and	 experienced	 as	 the	 bad	 breast
hating	 the	 infant.	 This	 bad	 breast	 is	 also
internalized	 in	 order	 to	 control	 it	 (Klein	 1946).
The	 basic	 implication	 is	 that	 the	 infant	 can	 feel
supported	
or	
attacked	
from	
within	
itself.
Furthermore,	the	hate	and	love	can	be	reprojected
or	reintrojected,	so	that	if	the	hate	is	reprojected
or	 reintrojected	 a	 vicious	 cycle	 of	 an	 increased
sense	 of	 persecution	 from	 within	 or	 without	 is
produced;	if	love	is	reprojected	and	reintrojected,
a	cycle	of	increased	well-being	is	begun.
Klein	introduced	confusion	through	the	use	of
her	 term	 “part-object”	 (see	 OBJECT).	 Kernberg
(1980)	points	out	that	she	used	this	term	in	two
ways.	 First,	 Klein	 meant	 to	 represent	 a	 partial
anatomical	 aspect	 of	 a	 real	 person,	 such	 as	 the
breast,	which	the	infant	perceives	as	if	it	were	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
653
object	to	which	the	infant	is	relating.	The	second
sense—	 predominantly	 used	 by	 Kleinian	 authors
—is	 explained	 by	 Kernberg	 thus:	 “As	 a	 result	 of
splitting,	 part-objects	 constitute	 either	 part	 of
persons	or	total	persons	perceived	in	a	distorted,
unrealistic	 way	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 the
projection	 of	 pure	 libido	 or	 aggression,	 so	 that
those	 objects	 are	 either	 all	 good	 or	 all	 bad”	 (p.
882).
The	 second	 half	 of	 the	 first	 year	 of	 life,
according	 to	 Klein,	 is	 marked	 by	 the	 depressive
position	 (see	 DEPRESSIVE	 POSITION),	 emerging
as	self	and	object	differentiation	becomes	possible
in	a	cognitive	sense.	Splitting	into	part	objects	is
less	 present;	 as	 a	 result,	 anxiety	 occurs	 over	 the
loss	of	good	objects	without	and	within,	ushering
in	the	depressive	position.	This	is	a	consequence
of	 the	 capacity	 for	 internalizing	 whole	 objects,
which	Klein	says	begins	in	the	second	quarter	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
654
the	first	year	of	life.	The	infant	fears	that	its	own
destructive,	greedy	impulses	will	destroy	the	good
breast,	which	is	later	expressed	as	the	child’s	fear
that	the	parent	may	die.	The	destructive	impulses
can	 destroy	 the	 good	 breast	 by	 appropriating	 it;
this	
is	
sometimes	
distinguished	
from	
the
destruction	 of	 the	 breast	 due	 to	 envy,	 to	 be
discussed	shortly.	At	any	rate,	a	state	of	sadness	is
ushered	 in	 and	 becomes	 the	 key	 hurdle	 in
ordinary	 development.	 If	 it	 is	 too	 painful,	 a
regression	to	the	paranoid-schizoid	position	or	a
defensive	swing	to	the	manic	state	occurs,	and	the
psychological	
groundwork	
is	
laid	
for	
the
psychoses.
The	 good	 and	 bad	 breasts	 in	 the	 paranoid-
schizoid	 position	 are	 forerunners	 of	 the	 benign
and	harsh	superego.	For	Klein,	the	oedipal	triangle
begins	 in	 the	 oral	 stage,	 and	 there	 is	 an	 inborn
knowledge	 of	 the	 genitals	 of	 both	 sexes.	 Thus
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
655
there	 is	 a	 long	 and	 complex	 prehistory	 before
Freud’s	 oedipal	 stage,	 involving	 combinations	 of
parents,	
splitting,	
projections,	
and
internalizations.	 There	 may	 be	 a	 premature
advance	 into	 oedipal	 material	 due	 to	 the	 use	 of
genital	
love	
mobilized	
against	
pregenital
aggression.
The	 fourth	 set	 of	 Kleinian	 concepts	 are
introjective	
identification	
and	
projective
identification.	 Introjective	 identification	 results
from	 the	 introjection	 of	 the	 object.	 Projective
identification	 is	 a	 hybrid	 concept	 that	 is	 used
differently	 by	 every	 subsequent	 author	 (see
PROJECTIVE	IDENTIFICATION).
The	fifth	basic	concept	was	introduced	by	Klein
in	her	seventies	as	a	major	addition	and	produced
new	storms	of	protest	against	what	she	assumed
was	 possible	 in	 the	 mind	 of	 the	 infant.	 She
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
656
believed	that	there	was	an	early	infantile	form	of
envy,	 also	 based	 on	 the	 death	 instinct,	 that	 was
aimed	 at	 the	 destruction	 and	 possession	 of	 the
envied	good	breast	(or	in	treatment,	the	imagined
serene	 analyst);	 furthermore,	 that	 there	 was	 a
constitutional	variation	in	the	amount	of	envy	and
aggression	 present	 in	 each	 individual	 (see	 ENVY
and	JEALOUSY).
Oral	sadism	is	the	first	critical	manifestation	of
the	 death	 instinct	 (see	 DEATH	 INSTINCT	 and
SADISM).	 Oral	 sadism	 varies	 with	 constitutional
strength	 and	 is	 the	 key	 to	 understanding	 human
development	 and	 pathology.	 It	 is	 first	 projected,
resulting	 in	 persecutory	 fears	 and	 the	 fear	 of
annihilation	 by	 the	 destructive	 devouring	 breast.
The	first	source	of	anxiety	arises	when	projected
oral	 sadism	 threatens	 to	 destroy	 and	 invade	 the
ego	 or	 self	 (again,	 not	 carefully	 differentiated	 by
Klein).	 Oral	 sadism	 also	 produces	 envy,	 which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
657
appears	first;	the	breast	is	experienced	as	willfully
withholding,	 and	 there	 is	 a	 wish	 to	 scoop	 out,
destroy,	and	possess	it.	Later	derivations	of	envy
are	greed,	which	is	a	more	sophisticated	form	of
envy	 and	 arises	 from	 it,	 and	 jealousy,	 a	 later
emotional	
development	
characteristic	
of
triangular	situations,	such	as	the	oedipal	conflicts.
Here	a	third	person	is	hated	because	that	person
preempts	 the	 desired	 love.	 It	 follows	 that
constitutionally	excessive	aggression	would	foster
a	 great	 deal	 of	 splitting	 and	 denial	 of	 reality	 in
order	 to	 deal	 with	 these	 affects,	 and	 their
associated	fantasies,	constituting	envy,	greed,	and
jealousy.
Conversely,	 the	 projection	 of	 “good”	 inner
objects	onto	new	objects	forms	the	basis	of	trust	in
later	life.	Gratitude	comes	from	good	experiences,
decreases	greed,	and	leads	to	a	healthy	generosity
in	
contrast	
to	
what	
Klein	
calls	
“reactive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
658
generosity,”	a	defense	against	envy	that	eventually
ends	in	feelings	of	being	robbed.
Splitting	 originally	 occurs	 in	 good	 objects
which	 are	 introjected	 and	 bad	 ones	 which	 are
projected,	but	a	secondary	splitting	can	take	place
when	 aggression	 is	 strong	 and	 there	 is	 a	 related
predominance	 of	 bad	 objects.	 These	 bad	 objects
are	 then	 further	 split	 into	 fragments	 and	 when
these	fragments	are	projected	we	get	the	multiple
persecutors	 or	 the	 so-called	 “bizarre	 objects”
described	 dramatically	 by	 Klein’s	 analysand	 and
follower,	Bion	(1963,	1967).
Narcissistic	internal	structures	and	narcissistic
object	 relationships	 arise	 in	 an	 effort	 to	 escape
persecutory	fears	by	an	excessive	dependence	on
an	 idealized	 object	 and	 by	 the	 use	 of	 others	 to
confirm	 one’s	 grandiosity.	 The	 idealization	 of
external	objects	in	the	paranoid-schizoid	position
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
659
is	 marked	 by	 fantasies	 of	 unlimited	 gratification
from	these	objects,	which	protects	the	individual
against	
frustration,	
denies	
any	
need	
for
aggression,	 and	 protects	 the	 individual	 against
persecutory	fears	from	the	objects.
The	 idealization	 of	 internal	 objects	 in	 the
depressive	position	protects	the	individual	against
unbearable	 reality.	 The	 denial	 of	 internal	 and
external	
reality	
represents	
the	
denial	
of
aggression	 and	 is	 a	 form	 of	 hallucinatory	 wish
fulfillment	 at	 the	 cost	 of	 reality	 testing.	 The
aggression	of	both	the	bad	inner	and	outer	objects
is	denied.
Sexual	 promiscuity	 or	 sexual	 conquests,	 seen
commonly	 in	 the	 narcissistic	 disorders,	 may
represent	the	turning	from	one	idealized	object	to
another	in	a	desperate	attempt	to	escape	imagined
inner	 and	 outer	 persecutors.	 Hypochondriasis	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
660
explained	 as	 the	 projection	 of	 persecutory	 bad
objects	 to	 parts	 of	 one’s	 own	 body;	 the	 fear	 of
poisoning	 and	 of	 pathological	 control	 from	 the
outside	is	based	on	a	combination	of	persecutory
paranoid	and	hypochondriacal	fears.
In	the	depressive	position	the	fear	shifts	from
that	 of	 a	 persecutory	 fear	 to	 one	 of	 harming	 the
good	internal	object,	and	idealization	is	used	here
to	 protect	 against	 aggression	 toward	 the	 good
internal	object.	Depressive	anxiety	or	guilt	about
the	 survival	 of	 good	 inner	 and	 outer	 objects	 is
critical,	so	the	object	is	idealized	in	the	depressive
position	to	protect	against	aggression	to	it	and	to
remove	 guilt	 over	 this	 aggression.	 In	 contrast	 to
Kohut,	idealization	is	used	in	both	of	Klein’s	basic
positions	 as	 a	 defense	 against	 sadism	 and
destruction	 in	 fantasy	 (Segal	 1974,	 1980).
Internalized	bad	objects	are	no	longer	projected	in
the	depressive	position,	nor	are	they	reintrojected,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
661
because	 now	 the	 total	 object	 is	 experienced.
Therefore,	 the	 internal	 bad	 objects	 remain,
forming	 the	 roots	 of	 the	 primitive	 superego	 that
attacks	 the	 ego	 or	 self	 with	 guilt	 feelings.	 Good
internal	objects	attenuate	this	attack.
The	standards	set	by	or	the	demands	coming
from	the	idealized	good	internal	objects	become,
when	
combined	
with	
sadistic	
superego
precursors,	 cruel	 demands	 for	 perfection	 leading
to	an	unremitting	harshness	of	the	superego.	This
is	 complicated,	 in	 cases	 where	 there	 is	 much
sadism,	due	to	the	need	to	protect	the	good	objects
in	 the	 superego	 by	 excessive	 idealization.	 The
result	 is	 that	 the	 standards	 of	 the	 superego
become	extremely	high.

LACAN,	JACQUES
(1901-1981)
In	 their	 guide	 to	 the	 maverick	 French
psychoanalyst	 Lacan’s	 (1977)	 Ecrits,	 Muller	 and
Richardson	 (1982)	 explain	 how	 Lacan	 translates
the	 topographic	 theory	 of	 early	 Freud	 into
linguistics.	 Free	 association	 is	 thought	 of	 as	 the
flow	 of	 “Signifiers,”	 a	 term	 borrowed	 from	 the
linguistic	theory	of	Saussure	(1986).	Each	Signifier
refers	 not	 to	 an	 individual	 “signified”	 mental
concept	 of	 desire,	 but	 to	 another	 Signifier	 in	 the
chain	of	free	associations.	The	subject,	as	he	or	she
develops	and	becomes	articulated	with	language,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
665
increasingly	alienates	primary	unconscious	desire
in	the	Signifier	chain.	As	Lacan	puts	it,	we	end	up
with	the	wanderings	of	true	desire	caught	in	the
net	of	Signifiers;	It	is	the	It	that	speaks.
Freud’s	 condensation	 aspect	 of	 primary
process,	according	to	Lacan,	is	actually	metaphor,
a	linguistic	process	in	which	one	phrase	stands	for
a	set	of	others	suggesting	a	likeness;	for	example,
“a	volley	of	oaths.”	Condensation	in	Freud’s	theory
is	 therefore	 a	 series	 of	 Signifiers	 connected
through	
metaphor.	
Freud’s	
displacement	
is
metonomy,	 a	 linguistic	 process	 in	 which	 one
contiguous	 element	 stands	 for	 another;	 for
example,	“a	good	table”	for	good	food.	When	Lacan
makes	 his	 most	 famous	 statement	 that	 the
unconscious	 is	 structured	 like	 a	 language,	 he
means	that	the	unconscious	consists	of	repressed
early	Signifiers	of	desire	connected	by	the	rules	of
metonomy	 and	 metaphor.	 The	 unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
666
consists	entirely	of	early	Signifiers	that	had	to	be
further	linguistically	disguised	due	to	the	demands
of	 fitting	 into	 the	 cultural	 order.	 There	 are	 no
drives	and	no	instincts;	no	biology	is	involved.
According	 to	 Lacan,	 the	 phase	 of	 inaugural
primary	 narcissism	 (unbounded	 phase)	 occurs
first	 in	 human	 development.	 Next	 comes	 the
imaginary	 or	 mirror	 stage,	 which	 is	 preverbal,
presymbolic,	 and	 forms	 a	 false	 ego.	 This	 is
described	at	length	in	Lacan’s	(1968)	famous	1953
speech	delivered	in	Rome	and	forms	the	basis	of
his	 disagreement	 with	 traditional	 psychoanalytic
structural	theory	(see	MIRROR	STAGE).	Then,	in	a
brief	transitory	stage,	the	child	comes	up	against
the	“forbidden.”	This	results	in	the	symbolic	stage
as	 the	 child	 acquires	 language;	 there	 is	 a	 split
between	 the	 inner	 and	 outer	 world,	 between	 a
false	 “I,”	 (a	 false	 ego)	 and	 the	 outer	 world.	 To
resolve	 this,	 the	 child	 must	 identify	 with	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
667
father’s	 laws	 and	 cultural	 order	 and	 enter	 the
quest	 for	 objects	 in	 a	 manner	 ever	 further
removed	 from	 its	 original	 desire.	 (Later,	 Lacan
calls	these	stages	perceptual	orders,	since	they	can
exist	simultaneously.)
The	child	originally	desires	to	be	a	phallus	in
union	 with	 the	 mother.	 It	 is	 the	 desire	 to	 be	 the
desired	of	the	mother,	to	be	the	mother’s	phallus.
Lacan	sometimes	uses	the	word	“phallus”	here	as
a	 symbol;	 he	 is	 not	 using	 it	 only	 specifically	 to
mean	 the	 penis.	 It	 represents	 what	 the	 mother
wants	 the	 most,	 that	 which	 would	 bring	 her
fulfillment.	 To	 understand	 Lacan,	 one	 must	 be
familiar	with	Hegel,	who	held	that	“desire”	is	to	be
the	desired	of	the	other	person	(see	DESIRE).	As
one	 develops	 toward	 adulthood,	 the	 chain	 of
Signifiers	 moves	 further	 from	 the	 originally
signified	 desire	 and	 from	 one’s	 true	 self	 and,
consequently,	from	understanding	the	meaning	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
668
one’s	own	speech.	The	adult	individual	knows	less
about	what	is	really	meant	by	his	or	her	linguistic
expressions	when	speaking	to	another	person.
There	 are	 three	 fundamental	 ideas	 in	 Lacan.
First,	 the	 individual	 is	 constituted	 by	 language.
The	individual	has	no	essence,	center,	or	instincts.
The	 unconscious	 consists	 only	 of	 the	 earliest
Signifiers,	 which	 are	 structured	 like	 a	 language.
Second,	 discourse	 embodies	 society;	 politics	 is
embedded	in	our	language	and	we	are	all	caught
up	 in	 it,	 since	 the	 human	 being	 is	 only	 an
individual	 subject	 because	 of	 language	 and
membership	 in	 society.	 Third,	 there	 is	 no	 such
thing	as	an	autonomous	ego.	This	is	a	false	notion,
an	 ex	 post	 facto	 explanation,	 says	 Lacan.	 Lacan
maintains	that	the	ego	is	always	false	and	stands
in	the	way	of	knowledge	of	our	true	desires.
For	 Lacan,	 desire	 is	 the	 driving	 human	 force,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
669
not	 libido.	 It	 comes	 from	 animal	 demand,	 the
demand	 of	 the	 brute,	 as	 he	 calls	 it.	 The	 infant
begins	 in	 a	 dual	 symbiosis	 with	 the	 mother,	 the
realm	of	primary	narcissism.	As	this	ruptures,	the
infant	 realizes	 that	 it	 is	 not	 the	 mother.	 At	 this
point	 human	 want	 begins	 to	 appear,	 the	 human
form	of	desire.	The	human	desires	the	paradise	of
fusion	 with	 the	 mother,	 to	 be	 what	 the	 mother
desires	most	and	in	a	fusion	with	her.	Lacan	uses
for	this	the	symbol	“phallus,”	which	is	the	Signifier
of	this	desire	for	perfect	union	with	the	mother.
For	 Lacan,	 a	 primordial	 castration	 has
occurred	when	this	fusion	is	inevitably	disrupted
by	 the	 vicissitudes	 of	 development.	 Following
Heidegger,	 the	 first	 experience	 of	 human	 limit
occurs	 when	 this	 union	 is	 ruptured.	 Lacan	 does
not	distinguish	between	male	and	female	earliest
development.	 The	 dialectic	 of	 desire,	 based	 on
Hegel’s	theory,	occurs	next.	The	ultimate	quest	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
670
to	be	recognized	and	desired	by	the	desired.	This
is	 closely	 related	 to	 the	 “gleam	 in	 the	 mother’s
eye”	 that	 Kohut	 mentions.	 Indeed,	 for	 Kohut
(1971)	 there	 is	 also	 a	 “mirror	 stage”	 (p.	 124)	 of
preverbal	 beginnings,	 but	 there	 the	 similarity
ends,	 for	 Kohut’s	 mirror	 stage	 involves	 the
mirroring	and	confirming	response	of	the	archaic
selfobject	 to	 the	 emerging	 self	 of	 the	 infant	 and
does	 not	 involve	 either	 mirrors	 or	 imaginings.
Kohut	is	referring	to	an	experience,	not	an	image.
For	Lacan,	the	child	wants	to	be	the	desired	of	the
mother,	her	fullness,	her	phallus,	but	must	end	up
expressing	 only	 culturally	 legitimate	 desires
through	 endless	 derivative	 Signifier	 chains,
multiple	displacements	in	language.
It	 is	 impossible	 to	 become	 the	 desired	 of	 the
mother	because	the	father,	who	has	the	phallus,	is
there.	 When	 Lacan	 uses	 the	 term	 “father,”	 he
means	three	things:	the	real	father,	the	imaginary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
671
father,	 and	 the	 law	 of	 the	 father.	 For	 Lacan,	 the
father	 is	 a	 spoilsport.	 He	 says	 to	 the	 infant,	 you
cannot	 sleep	 with	 your	 mother.	 He	 says	 to	 the
mother,	 you	 cannot	 reappropriate	 your	 product.
So	 the	 oedipal	 struggle	 is	 in	 having	 to	 forgo	 the
original	 desire	 and	 channel	 it	 through	 the
symbolic	cultural	order,	expressing	it	in	some	way
through	 words.	 It	 is	 interesting	 to	 compare	 this
with	 the	 traditional	 drive-conflict	 psychoanalytic
view	of	the	resolution	of	the	oedipal	struggle.	For
example,	Loewald	(1980)	describes	the	father	as
representing	“castrating	reality.”	He	explains,	“The
longing	 for	 the	 father,	 seeking	 his	 help	 and
protection,	is	a	defensive	compromise	in	order	to
come	to	terms	with	his	superior,	hostile	power”	(p.
9).	For	Lacan,	to	identify	with	the	father	is	to	find
legitimate	 Signifies,	 which	 means	 accepting	 the
culture,	the	facts	of	life,	and	human	finitude.	This
is	 a	 process	 that	 Lacan	 calls	 oedipization,	 by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
672
means	of	which	one	enters	the	social	order.	When
one	has	accomplished	this,	the	oedipal	struggle	is
resolved;	from	then	on	in	one’s	language,	a	chain
of	 Signifiers	 occurs	 in	 which	 the	 signified	 desire
becomes	 hidden,	 sliding	 incessantly	 under	 the
chain	of	Signifiers.
This	concept	of	the	signified	“sliding”	under	a
chain	 of	 Signifiers	 is	 central	 to	 Lacan’s	 theory	 of
treatment.	
For	
Lacan,	
psychoanalysis	
is
hermeneutics.	 It	 brings	 out	 underlying	 contexts
and	structures	from	the	unconscious.	It	reveals	a
personal	code.	The	past	is	hidden	by	the	linguistic
transformations	that	occur	because	the	individual
must	 fit	 into	 the	 symbolic	 order.	 Historical
reconstruction	in	psychoanalysis	is	not	important,
for	psychoanalysis	is	a	discourse	with	the	other.	It
brings	to	light	the	desires	that	are	hidden	in	the
metaphors	 and	 tropes,	 for	 the	 human	 subject	 is
endlessly	 displaced	 and	 reconstituted	 by	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
673
symbolic	order	of	desire	through	which	language
passes.	This	study	of	the	patient’s	language,	says
Lacan,	 can	 guide	 the	 patient	 back	 to	 insatiable,
unconscious	desires.
“Repression”	 for	 Lacan	 is	 simply	 a	 set	 of
linguistic	 transformations	 using	 metaphor	 and
metonomy	that	the	child	must	use	to	fit	into	the
symbolic	 order	 during	 oedipalization.	 In	 this
sense,	according	to	Lacan,	“Man	is	a	marionette	of
his	culture.”	The	enemy	is	the	ego	that	is	born	in
the	mirror	phase,	a	false	notion	that	the	individual
has	of	the	self	as	an	entity.
In	
summary,	
Lacan	
decenters	
the	
self.
Everyone	has	a	divided	self,	says	Lacan;	from	the
mirror	stage	on	we	are	all	alienated	from	our	true
self.	 There	 is	 no	 autonomous	 ego	 or	 center	 to	 a
person.	 Lacan	 changes	 the	 focus	 of	 theory	 from
biology	 or	 instincts	 to	 language,	 and	 from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
674
mechanisms	 to	 tropes.	 There	 is	 no	 original
instinctual	unconscious,	only	chains	of	Signifiers	in
the	 unconscious.	 In	 psychopathology	 the	 person
loses	his	or	her	grip	on	the	chain	of	Signifiers,	and
the	 analyst	 must	 restore	 discourse	 to	 its	 owner.
Psychiatric	 labels	 are	 useless,	 for	 each	 person’s
unique	narrative	is	crucial.
For	
Lacan	
(1978),	
psychoanalysis	
or
psychoanalytic	psychotherapy	is	a	reversal	due	to
the	“dummy”	(le	mort)	analyst.	The	silence	of	the
analyst	 causes	 a	 two-fold	 regression:	 backward
among	the	chains	of	Signifiers	“undoing	the	secret
knots,”	 as	 Lacan	 puts	 it,	 toward	 the	 unconscious
primal	 Signifiers	 of	 desire	 that	 constitute	 the
unconscious;	 and	 to	 the	 loss	 of	 false	 narcissistic
images	 by	 which	 the	 ego	 is	 constituted	 in	 the
mirror	 stage.	 This	 regression	 is	 caused	 by	 the
frustration	
of	
the	
patient’s	
desire	
in	
the
psychoanalytic	 situation.	 The	 dummy	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
675
analyst	 frustrates	 the	 patient’s	 demand.	 Through
transference,	 the	 chain	 of	 Signifiers	 retrogresses
until	 it	 reaches	 the	 truth	 of	 the	 patient’s	 desires
and	 restores	 full	 speech	 to	 the	 patient.	 Ça	 parle,
the	 it	 speaks,	 much	 more	 directly	 when	 that	 has
been	 achieved,	 says	 Lacan	 (see	 LACAN’S	 “LE
MORT”).

LACAN’S	“LE	MORT”
(THE	DUMMY)
Portrayed	here	is	a	clinical	model	from	Lacan’s
(1977)	Ecrits.	In	“The	Direction	of	the	Treatment
and	 the	 Principles	 of	 Its	 Power,”	 presented	 in
1958,	
Lacan	
compares	
the	
practice	
of
psychoanalytic	psychotherapy	to	a	game	of	bridge
involving	 four	 players	 (p.	 229).	 The	 analyst’s
crucial	role	is	that	of	the	silently	listening	bridge
“dummy”	 (le	 mort),	 and	 the	 purpose	 of	 the
treatment	is	to	induce	the	Other	of	the	patient	(the
patient’s	unconscious,	in	Lacan’s	terms)	to	speak.
The	 four	 “players”	 would	 be	 the	 consciously
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
677
speaking	patient,	the	patient’s	unconscious	Other,
the	 speaking	 analyst,	 and	 the	 silent,	 “dummy”
analyst.
For	 Lacan	 (1968),	 psychoanalysis	 stresses
“distracted	 listening”	 for	 the	 “return	 of	 truth”	 in
the	 patient’s	 discourse	 in	 the	 form	 of	 figures	 of
speech	 or	 tropes,	 allusions,	 puns,	 equivocations,
slips,	 and	 dreams,	 always	 concealing	 desire;	 the
material	is	heard	like	polyphonic	music.	The	goal
of	 treatment	 is	 to	 move	 from	 “empty	 speech”	 to
“full	 speech,”	 in	 which	 the	 analyst	 reflects	 the
message	 of	 the	 “it”	 to	 the	 subject.	 There	 is	 no
offering	 of	 the	 therapist	 as	 a	 model	 for
identification,	 no	 strengthening	 of	 the	 ego,	 no
holding	 or	 nurturing	 or	 repair	 of	 structural
deficits;	 there	 is,	 however,	 a	 deemphasis	 on
interpretation	of	resistances	and	defenses.
Lacan	 (see	 LACAN)	 posited	 four	 stages	 or,	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
678
he	 later	 referred	 to	 them,	 “perceptual	 orders”	 in
human	 development:	 (1)	 the	 inaugural	 primary
narcissism	 or	 unbounded	 chaotic	 fragmented
stage;	(2)	the	imaginary	or	mirror	stage,	which	is
preverbal	and	presymbolic	and	forms	a	false	ego
distinct	 from	 the	 truth	 about	 the	 subject	 (this
claim	 that	 the	 ego	 is	 a	 false	 and	 alien	 image—as
described	 in	 Lacan’s	 [1968]	 famous	 speech
delivered	
in	
1953—is	
the	
basis	
of	
his
disagreement	 with	 traditional	 psychoanalytic
structural	 theory);	 (3)	 the	 brief	 transitory	 stage,
when	the	child	comes	up	against	the	“forbidden”;
and	(4)	the	symbolic	stage,	which	is	constituted	as
the	 child	 acquires	 language	 and	 produces	 a	 split
between	the	inner	and	outer	world.	In	order	to	do
this,	the	child	must	identify	with	the	father’s	laws
and	cultural	order	and	enter	the	quest	for	objects
in	a	manner	further	and	further	removed	from	its
original	desire.	For	Lacan,	this	original	desire	is	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
679
be	a	phallus	in	union	with	the	mother	(i.e.,	it	is	the
desire	to	be	the	desired	of	the	mother,	for	which
the	phallus	is	the	primal	signifier).	As	one	moves
in	the	chain	of	verbal	signifiers	from	the	originally
signified	 desire,	 one	 moves	 away	 from	 one’s
individual	 truth,	 one’s	 true	 wishes,	 and	 from
understanding	
the	
meaning	
of	
one’s	
own
utterances.	 So	 the	 maturing	 adult	 individual
knows	 less	 and	 less	 about	 what	 he	 or	 she	 really
means	 to	 say	 when	 he	 or	 she	 speaks	 to	 another
person.
The	
past	
is	
hidden	
by	
linguistic
transformations	as	a	result	of	having	to	fit	into	the
symbolic	 and	 cultural	 order.	 The	 psychoanalytic
process	brings	to	light	the	desires	that	are	hidden
in	 the	 metaphors	 and	 tropes,	 for	 the	 human
subject	is	endlessly	displaced	and	reconstituted	by
the	 symbolic	 order	 of	 language	 through	 which
desire	 must	 pass,	 and	 then	 be	 translated	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
680
communicated.	 This	 study	 of	 the	 patient’s
language,	says	Lacan,	can	guide	the	therapist	and
patient	back	to	the	patient’s	unconscious	desires.
The	main	advantage	of	Lacan’s	approach	is	in	his
stress	 on	 the	 informed	 doctor	 who	 relates	 to	 a
patient	 as	 an	 autonomous	 specific	 individual
human	subject	and	tunes	in	to	what	the	patient	is
uniquely	
saying—the	
central	
goal	
of
psychoanalytic	listening.
One	 way	 this	 is	 accomplished	 is	 through	 the
silence	 of	 the	 “dummy”	 analyst,	 which	 induces	 a
twofold	 regression	 in	 the	 patient:	 (1)	 backwards
along	 the	 chains	 of	 signifiers	 to	 the	 unconscious
primary	 signifiers	 of	 desire	 that	 constitute	 the
unconscious;	 and	 (2)	 to	 the	 loss	 of	 false
narcissistic	images	by	which	the	ego	is	constituted,
starting	 in	 the	 fragmented	 stage,	 consolidated	 in
the	 mirror	 stage,	 and	 continuing	 throughout	 life.
What	 causes	 this	 regression	 is	 the	 frustration	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
681
the	patient’s	desire	in	the	psychoanalytic	situation
as	 the	 “dummy”	 analyst	 does	 not	 respond	 to	 the
patient’s	 demand.	 This	 generates	 a	 backward
motion	 along	 the	 patient’s	 chain	 of	 signifiers.
Through	transference	it	reaches	what	Lacan	calls
the	truth	of	the	patient’s	desires,	and	restores	full
speech	to	the	patient.
In	
Lacan’s	
bridge-game	
model	
of
psychoanalytic	
psychotherapy,	
the	
patient’s
conscious	 speaks	 first;	 but	 contained	 in	 this
speech	 are	 the	 desires	 from	 the	 patient’s	 Other,
hidden	 in	 metaphors	 or	 tropes,	 allusions,	 jokes,
equivocations,	 slips,	 and	 dreams.	 These	 are
addressed	 toward	 the	 “dummy”	 analyst,	 who	 is
relatively	 silent	 because	 it	 is	 the	 analyst’s
professional	 obligation	 to	 keep	 his	 or	 her	 own
desires	 unvoiced	 in	 the	 treatment;	 otherwise,
explains	 Lacan,	 “the	 game	 will	 proceed	 without
anyone	knowing	who	is	leading”	(p.	230).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
682
The	conscious-speaking	analyst	has	the	option,
as	Lacan	puts	it,	to	play	either	to	the	right	or	to	the
left	 of	 the	 opening	 player	 (the	 patient).	 If	 the
analyst’s	 self	 intervenes	 before	 the	 patient
experiences	the	“dummy”	analyst,	for	example	by
responding	 to	 the	 conscious	 spoken	 demands	 of
the	 patient	 in	 some	 way	 such	 as	 attempting	 to
offer	 a	 model	 for	 identification,	 “strengthen	 the
ego,”	support,	hold,	nurture,	advise,	or	repair	the
patient,	 then	 the	 patient’s	 Other	 will	 never	 be
stimulated	 to	 speak	 in	 expressions	 containing
more	 and	 more	 regressed	 and	 original	 chains	 of
the	 signifiers	 of	 desire.	 If	 the	 analyst’s	 conscious
subject	plays	after	the	patient	has	experienced	the
“dummy”	 analyst	 and	 has	 responded,	 then	 the
analyst	is	in	a	position	to	return	the	voice	of	the
patient’s	Other	back	to	the	patient	and	restore	the
patient	to	fuller	speech.

Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773),	 surely	 a	 man	 who
never	 experienced	 it	 himself,	 defined	 leisure	 as
“freedom	 from	 business	 or	 hurry;	 a	 vacancy	 of
mind;	 power	 to	 spend	 time	 according	 to	 choice”
(p.	 1133).	 This	 somewhat	 ambivalent	 definition
underestimates	the	extreme	importance	of	leisure
as	the	basis	of	culture,	and	the	use	of	leisure	as	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
684
measure	of	a	person’s	maturity.	It	is	important	in
taking	 a	 psychiatric	 history	 to	 ask	 patients
specifically	 whether	 they	 experience	 leisure	 and
how	they	employ	leisure;	this	information	can	tell
a	great	deal	about	the	patient’s	lifestyle,	superego,
level	of	maturity,	and	intrinsic	energies.
There	have	been	very	few	good	references	on
the	subject.	In	a	diary	note	on	October	7,	1962,	I
reviewed	
an	
unusual	
new	
book	
by
DeGrazia(1962),	as	follows:
[DeGrazia]	 chooses	 Aristotle's	 definition	 of
leisure	as	part	of	the	contemplative	life	and
sharply	separates	it	from	“free	time”	which	is
merely	for	recuperation	from	work.	Leisure
is	 a	 great	 rarity	 these	 days	 and	 there	 is	 a
certain	 snobbish	 implication	 by	 DeGrazia
that	 those	 who	 live	 the	 leisurely	 life	 are
better.	 He	 notes	 that	 leisure	 requires
sacrifice	and	is	a	state	of	being	in	which	an
activity	is	performed	for	its	own	sake	or	its
own	 end.	 ...	 He	 suggests	 music,	 and
contemplation,	 and	 friends	 chosen	 for	 their
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
685
own	worth.
DeGrazia	presents	statistics	to	show	that	work
and	work-oriented	free	time	are	in	about	the	same
proportion	as	they	always	have	been,	but	leisure
time	is	even	less	available	than	before.	He	warns
how	advertising	has	moved	in	to	utilize	free	time,
reducing	the	share	of	time	that	can	be	devoted	to
leisure,	 and	 he	 discusses	 the	 history	 of	 time,
concluding,	 “to	 have	 leisure	 one	 must	 be	 free	 of
the	 clock”	 (p.	 328).	 The	 question	 of	 leisure,
DeGrazia	 notes,	 is	 the	 question	 of	 whether
“parcels	of	time”	can	be	put	aside	for	a	person	to
be	 alone	 with	 himself	 or	 herself.	 Truth	 comes	 in
leisure,	 claims	 DeGrazia,	 and	 he	 warns	 that
democracy	 tends	 to	 seduce	 people	 away	 from
leisure.
Three	reasons	why	people	don’t	utilize	leisure
are:	first,	there	is	often	no	tradition	of	it,	as	in	our
culture;	 second,	 television	 and	 the	 advertising
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
686
industry	 are	 opposed	 to	 leisure	 and	 bring	 in	 a
different	 tradition—	 that	 of	 consumption;	 third,
according	 to	 DeGrazia,	 leisure	 is	 beyond	 the
capacity	of	most	people.	Culture	is	paideia,	surely
something	one	absorbs	as	a	child.	Many	people	do
not	have	the	intelligence,	or	the	temperament,	to
enjoy	leisure,	says	DeGrazia.	He	divides	the	world
into	two	classes	of	people:	the	great	majority	and
“the	 leisure	 kind.”	 The	 latter	 love	 ideas	 and
imagination—	 which	 provides	 them	 with	 both	 a
blessing	and	a	torment—and	they	create	culture.
It	 should	 be	 noted	 that	 these	 classes	 are	 not
related	to	the	“leisure	class”	discussed	in	Veblen’s
(1931)	 famous	 book	 dealing	 with	 conspicuous
consumption.
DeGrazia	claims	that	the	great	majority	envies
the	leisure	kind;	also,	each	of	these	two	classes	has
their	 own	 literature.	 He	 urges	 political	 action	 as
necessary	to	encourage	the	growth	of	the	leisure
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
687
class	and	ends	with	an	exhortation	for	us	to	live	a
life	of	good	quality.	He	warns	that	design	on	the
world	 fractionizes	 one’s	 view	 and	 unsettles	 the
mind:	 “The	 crowding	 of	 desires,	 one	 upon	 the
other,	can	shake	a	man’s	head	until	it	rattles”	(p.
420).
A	 sort	 of	 sequel	 to	 this	 work	 appeared	 eight
years	 later	 in	 Linder	 (1970).	 The	 motto	 of	 his
work	 is	 Horas	 non	 numero	 nisi	 serenas	 (Only	 the
quiet	 hours	 count).	 For	 Linder,	 cultivation	 of	 the
mind	 and	 spirit	 is	 “generally	 accepted”	 as	 a
supreme	goal,	and	increased	consumption	reduces
the	
time	
available	
for	
this.	
Self-discipline,
concentration,	 achieving	 excellence,	 and	 even
reading	a	book	intelligently	are	all	lost	due	to	the
pressures	of	time.	He	divides	time	into	four	kinds:
ordinary	 work	 time;	 personal	 work	 time,	 which
involves	 the	 maintenance	 of	 the	 body	 and	 one’s
property;	 consumption	 time	 for	 using	 these
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
688
material	 goods;	 and	 culture	 time,	 which	 Russell
(1972)	calls	“idleness.”	There	is,	of	course,	a	fifth
kind	of	time,	which	Linder	labels	“true	idleness,”
that	occurs	in	poverty	and	has	nothing	to	do	with
leisure.
The	 pursuit	 of	 money	 and	 prestige	 is	 not
compatible	 with	 the	 goal	 of	 having	 quiet	 hours.
The	enemies	of	leisure	are	the	wish	for	money	and
ambition,	 a	 harsh	 punitive	 driving	 superego,	 or,
using	self	psychology,	an	unconscious	clamor	for
archaic	grandiosity	and	exhibitionistic	mirroring.
Rybczynski	 (1991)	 presents	 a	 rather	 upbeat
discussion	 of	 how	 the	 weekend	 became	 a	 very
important	 temporal	 institution	 in	 modern	 times.
This	 is	 primarily	 an	 historical	 study,	 but
Rybczynski	recognizes	that	so-called	free	time	can
be	 gobbled	 up	 by	 a	 whole	 series	 of	 weekend
chores	 even	 more	 strenuous	 than	 one’s	 work
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
689
during	 the	 week:	 home	 repairs,	 gardening,
shopping,	athletics,	and	the	weekend	trips	on	the
crowded	 highways.	 A	 whole	 series	 of	 new	 tasks
have	 arisen	 in	 our	 day	 that	 might	 be	 called
“weekend	 work,”	 such	 as	 working	 at	 one’s	 golf
swing,	to	say	nothing	of	jogging,	weight	lifting,	and
all	 the	 other	 tortures	 that	 overfed	 Americans
impose	upon	themselves.	Add	to	that	a	good	deal
of	 unwanted	 but	 obligated	 Friday	 and	 Saturday
night	 socializing	 and	 one	 has	 a	 weekend
nightmare	 rather	 than	 a	 weekend	 of	 leisure.
Rybczynski	 does	 not	 recognize	 this,	 nor	 does	 he
deal	 with	 the	 problem	 of	 boredom	 on	 the
weekend,	 to	 say	 nothing	 about	 the	 brain-
stultifying	effect	on	those	unfortunate	individuals
who	 can	 find	 nothing	 better	 to	 do	 than	 lie	 in	 an
overstuffed	 chair	 in	 front	 of	 the	 TV.	 He	 sees	 the
weekend	as	a	chance	to	create	work	that	is	more
meaningful,	but	in	my	experience	that	is	not	what
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
690
the	great	majority	do	with	their	free	time.
None	 of	 these	 well-crafted	 discussions	 of
leisure	take	up	the	realistic	issues	of	the	individual
swept	 up	 by	 the	 materialistic	 values	 of	 our
civilization,	 or	 the	 patient	 driven	 by	 a	 relentless
superego	 or	 an	 unconscious	 archaic	 grandiosity.
These	 are	 serious	 clinical	 problems	 and	 because
this	 drive	 often	 results	 in	 financial	 or	 political
success,	 they	 are	 sometimes	 overlooked	 in	 our
patients.	Today	we	are	living	in	a	civilization	with
material	 wealth	 far	 greater	 than	 that	 ever
dreamed	of,	yet	we	have	less	true	leisure	than	the
lowest	ancient	shepherds,	who	could	play	the	lute
and	 give	 names	 to	 the	 constellations.	 As
Livingstone	 (in	 Hutchins	 1936)	 comments:	 “The
Greeks	could	not	broadcast	the	Aeschylean	trilogy,
but	 they	 could	 write	 it”	 (p.	 25n).	 Schor	 (1991)
points	 out	 that,	 contrary	 to	 all	 expectations,
Americans	 enjoy	 less	 leisure	 today	 than	 at	 any
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
691
time	 since	 the	 end	 of	 World	 War	 II,	 and	 she
documents	 this	 unanticipated	 decline	 in	 leisure
both	at	work	and	in	the	home.	Schor	argues	that
only	 in	 the	 eighteenth	 and	 nineteenth	 centuries
did	workers	in	Western	countries	have	longer	and
more	arduous	work	schedules	than	we	have	today,
so	 that	 there	 is	 a	 trend	 as	 old	 as	 the	 industrial
revolution	in	which	leisure	time	has	been	eroded
in	favor	of	the	strong	preference	of	employers	and
of	employees	for	longer	hours	and	more	money.
The	 major	 factor	 accounting	 for	 this	 is	 the
great	 stress	 our	 civilization	 has	 placed	 on	 the
acquisition	 of	 material	 wealth;	 as	 the	 value	 on
goods	 increases,	 the	 competition	 for	 them
becomes	keener	and	the	tempo	of	life	speeds	up.
In	 addition,	 our	 new	 industrial	 state	 has	 all	 the
communication	 techniques	 at	 its	 disposal	 to
manufacture	and	expand	our	wants.	When	this	is
coupled	with	the	fact	that	work	in	such	a	state	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
692
less	backbreaking,	in	the	literal	sense	of	the	word,
due	to	technological	progress,	it	is	not	hard	to	see
why	 the	 hours	 of	 “work”	 would	 tend	 to	 be
increased	in	an	effort	to	satisfy	all	the	new	wants
and	to	service	and	“enjoy”	all	the	new	gadgets	and
machines,	 from	 electric	 pencil	 sharpeners	 to
snowmobiles.
An	 additional	 paradox	 quickly	 unfolds	 with	 a
little	observation.	Greater	affluence	does	not	lead
to	more	happiness	or	even	to	a	more	relaxed	pace
of	 life;	 the	 contrary	 is	 true.	 As	 the	 physician,	 for
example,	works	his	way	up	from	the	impoverished
resident	or	intern	to	the	middle-aged	“pillar	of	the
community,”	life	does	not	tend	to	become	easier,
and	expenses	seem	constantly	to	rise	faster	than
income.	 This	 law	 as	 a	 generalization	 has	 been
formulated	by	the	clever	C.	N.	Parkinson.
We	are	faced	with	a	form	of	slavery,	the	danger
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
693
of	psychosomatic	breakdown,	increasing	economic
pressures,	and	unhappiness,	all	amazingly	enough
in	the	face	of	constantly	rising	personal	affluence.
The	solution	to	this	dilemma	is	to	live	a	life	of	good
quality.	As	Pieper	(1952)	said,	we	must	find	a	way
to	 substitute	 for	 restlessness	 (at	 the	 bottom	 of
which	 there	 sometimes	 appears	 to	 be	 a	 fanatical
and	
even	
ultimately	
suicidal	
activity)	
the
capability	of	seeing	life	as	a	whole	and	the	world
as	 a	 whole,	 and	 to	 act	 in	 accordance	 with	 this
extended	 viewpoint.	 This	 can	 only	 be	 done	 by
provision	 for	 an	 intelligent	 use	 of	 leisure	 time.
Pieper	(1952)	states:
The	point	and	justification	of	leisure	are	not
that	
the	
functionary	
should	
function
faultlessly	and	without	breakdown,	but	that
the	functionary	should	continue	to	be	a	man
—and	 that	 means	 that	 he	 should	 not	 be
wholly	absorbed	in	the	clearcut	milieu	of	his
strictly	limited	function;	the	point	is	also	that
he	 should	 continue	 to	 be	 capable	 of	 seeing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
694
life	as	a	whole	and	the	world	as	a	whole;	that
he	 should	 fulfill	 himself,	 and	 come	 to	 full
possession	of	his	faculties,	face	to	face	with
being	as	a	whole,	[p.	57]
There	 are	 many	 other	 ways	 of	 posing	 the
problem.	For	example,	Schopenhauer	saw	men	as
driven	by	an	unconscious	will	of	imperious	desire,
always	 striving,	 never	 satisfied.	 As	 long	 as	 the
consciousness	is	filled	by	the	will,	there	can	be	no
happiness	 and	 no	 peace,	 only	 at	 best	 a	 respite
from	pain,	which	itself	is	often	felt	as	boredom.	He
(in	Durant	1926)	writes:
To	see	how	short	life	is,	one	must	have	lived
long.	 …	 Up	 to	 our	 36th	 year	 we	 may	 be
compared,	in	respect	to	the	way	we	use	our
vital	 energy,	 to	 people	 who	 live	 on	 the
interest	 of	 their	 money;	 what	 they	 spend
today	 they	 have	 again	 tomorrow.	 But	 from
the	age	of	36	onward,	our	position	is	like	that
of	the	investor	who	begins	to	entrance	on	his
capital.	...	It	is	the	dread	of	this	calamity	that
makes	love	of	possession	increase	with	age.
[p.	356]
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
695
Although	insanity	and	suicide	are	discussed	by
Schopenhauer	as	ways	of	relief	from	the	world	of
the	strivings	of	“will,”	he	also	allows	the	possibility
of	 relief	 through	 use	 of	 the	 intellect	 to	 achieve
wisdom	 and	 enjoy	 the	 arts:	 “A	 man	 who	 has	 no
mental	 needs	 is	 called	 a	 Philistine;	 he	 does	 not
know	what	to	do	with	his	leisure—difficilis	in	otio
quies	 (Quiet	 in	 leisure	 is	 difficult);	 he	 searches
greedily	from	place	to	place	for	new	sensations	…”
(p.	359).
The	 ultimate	 deliverance	 from	 servitude
toward	the	“will”	and	material	interests	is	found	in
the	
contemplation	
of	
art,	
according	
to
Schopenhauer.	
His	
pessimism	
about	
man’s
captivation	by	the	“will”	would	certainly	be	borne
out	 by	 the	 recent	 trends	 in	 modern	 civilization
toward	worship	of	the	material	goods	of	life.	The
intelligent	 use	 of	 leisure	 is	 a	 significant	 mark	 of
psychological	maturity	(see	CORRUPTION).

LIBIDO
Most	 authors	 agree	 that,	 along	 with	 The
Interpretation	 of	 Dreams,	 Freud’s	 (1905)	 Three
Essays	 on	 the	 Theory	 of	 Sexuality	 represents	 his
greatest	 work.	 The	 three	 essays	 present	 an
elaboration	of	nosological	considerations	based	on
Freud’s	
theory	
of	
the	
sexual	
etiology	
of
psychogenic	disorders.	Freud’s	basic	libido	theory
was	set	down	in	these	three	essays	and	in	various
later	 contributions;	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 the
subject	is	presented	by	Nagera	(1969).
Freud	was	interested	in	the	vicissitudes	of	the
instincts	 as	 the	 individual	 grows	 up	 (see
INSTINCT),	 particularly	 the	 sexual	 instinct.	 The
“energy”	 of	 the	 sexual	 instinct	 is	 defined	 as	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
698
libido.	 Sexual	 life	 does	 not	 begin	 at	 puberty	 but
starts	with	clear	manifestations	soon	after	birth.	It
is	 necessary	 to	 distinguish	 sharply	 between	 the
concepts	of	sexual	and	genital.	The	former	is	the
wider	 concept	 and	 includes	 many	 activities	 that
have	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 the	 genitals.	 Sexual	 life
comprises	the	obtaining	of	pleasure	from	certain
zones	of	the	body,	an	activity	that	is	subsequently
brought	 into	 the	 service	 of	 reproduction.	 In
Freud’s	
early	
thinking	
these	
zones	
(see
EROTOGENIC	 ZONE)	 represented	 areas	 from
which	 libido	 arose	 or	 that	 were	 stimulated	 by
certain	 chemical	 or	 hormonal	 changes	 to	 bring
forth	 certain	 urgent	 impulses.	 Later	 they	 were
thought	 of	 as	 areas	 of	 pleasure	 through	 which
libido	could	be	discharged.
The	first	of	the	zones	to	appear	is	the	mouth.
During	the	oral	period,	the	infant	experiences	pure
pleasure	around	the	mouth.	Not	only	does	it	suck
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
699
in	 the	 milk	 that	 is	 necessary	 for	 life,	 but	 it	 also
enjoys	 stimulation	 of	 this	 erotogenic	 zone	 and
subsequent	libido	discharge.
The	 first	 half	 of	 the	 oral	 period,	 the	 first	 six
months	of	life,	is	thought	of	as	essentially	passive
in	Freud’s	libido	theory.	The	infant	desires	to	be
given	to	and	passively	receive	through	the	mouth.
It	wishes	to	suck	and	satiate,	to	fall	asleep	at	the
mother’s	 breast,	 to	 be	 devoured	 and	 returned
inside	the	mother.
The	 next	 six	 months	 of	 life,	 characterized	 by
the	development	of	teeth,	is	an	active,	or	sadistic,
oral	 stage.	 Here	 a	 new	 pleasure	 is	 found,	 that	 of
biting.	 Anger	 or	 rage	 experienced	 in	 the	 oral
period	is	reacted	to	by	a	hallucinatory	fantasy	of
biting,	 chewing,	 and	 devouring	 the	 frustrating
object.	 This	 may	 originally	 be	 a	 very	 pleasant
retaliation	 fantasy,	 but	 it	 often	 has	 to	 be	 deeply
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
700
repressed	 by	 the	 ego	 because	 the	 frustrating
object	is	most	often	the	mother.	There	would	be
danger	 if	 the	 mother	 were	 to	 be	 devoured	 and
destroyed	since	she	is	also	the	source	of	life	for	the
infant.
Between	the	ages	of	1	and	2	a	new	erotogenic
zone	 becomes	 important,	 the	 anus.	 Many	 of	 the
conflicts	 and	 problems	 of	 the	 2-year-old	 revolve
around	 toilet	 training	 and	 the	 production	 or
withholding	of	bowel	movements.	The	anal	stage
of	development	is	divided	by	some	into	an	active,
or	sadistic,	and	a	subsequent	passive,	or	retentive,
period.	 The	 active	 period	 appears	 first;	 the
appearance	 of	 the	 retentive	 period	 heralds	 the
beginning	of	true	object	love.	In	the	active	anal	or
anal-sadistic	stage,	the	predominant	fantasy	is	to
expel	 and	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 objects.	 Having	 a	 bowel
movement	is	conceived	of	as	the	hostile	expulsion
of	a	bad	object,	which	gives	a	pleasant	sensation.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
701
During	the	passive	anal	stage,	the	wish	to	retain	is
predominant.	The	child	may	enjoy	the	sensation	of
control	over	the	full	rectum,	and	battles	may	ensue
between	the	child	and	the	mother	as	to	where	and
when	it	should	have	the	bowel	movement.	In	the
act	 of	 defecation	 and	 the	 mother’s	 wiping	 and
cleaning,	 libido	 is	 discharged	 through	 the	 anal
erotogenic	zone.
Around	the	age	of	4	the	erotogenic	zone	shifts
to	 the	 genitalia.	 This	 has	 been	 called	 the	 phallic
and	 subsequent	 oedipal	 phase	 of	 development.
The	object	of	the	libido	at	the	age	of	5	is	the	parent
of	the	opposite	sex,	and	the	parent	of	the	same	sex
is	seen	as	a	rival.	The	fantasy	is	that	of	possessing
sexually	 the	 parent	 of	 the	 opposite	 sex	 and
destroying	or	getting	rid	of	the	parent	of	the	same
sex.	 Here	 again,	 although	 the	 fantasy	 may	 be
pleasant,	 it	 often	 has	 to	 be	 repressed	 because	 of
the	fear	of	retaliation,	especially	in	the	boy,	who
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
702
fears	 castration	 as	 retaliation	 for	 the	 desire	 to
possess	the	mother.
The	 oedipal	 phase	 is	 followed	 by	 a	 so-called
latent	 phase,	 in	 which	 no	 new	 erotogenic	 zones
are	 developed,	 and	 finally	 by	 adolescence.	 So
Freud	often	speaks	of	the	biphasic	nature	of	sexual
urges.	 The	 first	 great	 increase	 in	 sexual	 urge
occurs	around	the	age	of	5.	It	then	falls	off	with	the
passing	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 and	 reappears
again	 in	 adolescence.	 This	 is	 a	 biological
phenomenon,	part	of	the	process	of	maturation.
As	the	individual	advances	through	the	various
stages	of	psychosexual	development,	a	tendency	to
attach	 certain	 quantities	 of	 libido	 to	 earlier
erotogenic	 zones	 and	 associated	 fantasies	 is	 left
behind.	 Fixation	 depends	 on	 two	 factors:	 the
amount	 of	 overindulgence	 a	 person	 has	 had	 at	 a
given	 stage	 of	 development	 and	 the	 amount	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
703
deprivation	 a	 person	 has	 had	 at	 this	 period	 of
development.	 There	 is	 always	 some	 fixation	 in
everybody	 at	 all	 stages	 of	 development	 (see
FIXATION).
Later,	when	difficulties	in	living	arise,	there	is	a
tendency	to	regress	to	earlier	points	of	fixation	in
development	(see	REGRESSION).	A	price	has	to	be
paid	for	this	regression,	for	it	results	in	a	revival	of
problems	that	were	unsolved	and	unmastered	in
the	 earlier	 stage.	 These	 problems	 give	 rise	 to
anxiety	 because	 they	 involve	 the	 pressing	 for
expression	 of	 unsatisfied	 infantile	 impulses	 and
needs	that	are	unacceptable	to	the	ego;	this	forces
the	ego	to	use	additional	defense	mechanisms	to
aid	 repression.	 Often	 the	 defense	 mechanisms
used	in	this	situation	are	of	a	drastic	nature	and
exaggerated	quantity,	causing	the	individual	much
difficulty	in	life	and	leading	to	the	development	of
the	 clinical	 picture	 we	 call	 neurosis	 (see
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
704
NEUROSIS).	
Furthermore,	
guilt	
about	
the
regression	tends	to	increase	the	complications	and
stress	 of	 the	 situation	 and	 encourage	 more
regression.
The	case	of	Little	Hans	(Freud	1909)	illustrates
the	 application	 of	 Freud’s	 theories	 of	 infantile
sexuality	 to	 clinical	 situations.	 The	 symptoms	 of
neuroses	 develop	 as	 a	 converted	 expression	 of
impulses,	 which	 in	 a	 broader	 sense	 might	 be
designated	 as.	 perverse	 if	 they	 could	 manifest
themselves	 directly	 in	 purely	 conscious	 fantasies
and	acts.	The	polymorphous	perverse	disposition
is	 the	 primitive	 and	 universal	 disposition	 of	 the
human	sexual	impulse	from	which	normal	sexual
behavior	
develops	
as	
a	
consequence	
of
maturation,	
organic	
changes,	
and	
psychic
repression.	 At	 this	 point	 in	 his	 work,	 Freud
imagined	 libido	 as	 a	 quantum	 of	 sexual	 energy
arising	 from	 all	 over	 the	 body;	 the	 psychic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
705
representative	 of	 this	 is	 ego	 libido.	 Libido	 is
accessible	to	study	only	when	invested	in	objects;
libido	 can	 be	 given,	 removed,	 suspended,	 or
invested	in	the	self.	In	psychotherapy	we	study	the
vicissitudes	of	libido	in	the	individual’s	life	history
and	via	the	transference.
In	 his	 later	 work	 Freud	 (1914,	 1915)	 more
formally	described	the	libido	theory,	in	which	the
investment	
of	
libido	
in	
various	
mental
representations	
was	
called	
cathexis	
(see
CATHEXIS).	Libido	can	be	discharged	when	there
is	drive	gratification	or	be	dammed	up	if	it	is	not
discharged,	 which	 Freud	 thought	 led	 to	 the
formation	 of	 certain	 forms	 of	 psychasthenia.
Libido	cathected	to	one’s	self	representation	Freud
called	 ego	 libido,	 and	 libido	 cathected	 to	 various
object	representations	Freud	referred	to	as	object
libido.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
706
Freud	 (1937)	 described	 individuals	 whose
libido	
is	
readily	
attached	
to	
the	
object
representation	 of	 the	 analyst	 and	 so	 easily	 form
transferences	as	having	plastic	libido.	Those	who
cannot	 make	 such	 cathexis	 and	 who	 cling	 to	 a
heavy	
investment	
in	
archaic	
object
representations	 he	 described	 as	 having	 adhesive
libido,	 (see	 ADHESIVENESS	 OF	 THE	 LIBIDO).
Unfortunately,	the	concept	of	adhesive	libido	has
been	used	all	too	often	as	an	excuse	for	the	failure
of	 psychoanalytic	 treatment.	 It	 should	 be	 kept	 in
mind	that	this	is	a	hydrodynamic	theory	in	which
libido	is	conceived	of	as	analogous	to	energy,	but
the	 entire	 theory	 is	 a	 metaphor	 rather	 than	 a
quantitatively	 measurable	 hypothesis.	 As	 such,	 it
has	 been	 criticized	 from	 all	 sides,	 and	 some
psychoanalysts	have	advocated	its	abrogation	(see
METAPSYCHOLOGY).

LIMIT	SITUATIONS
(BOUNDARY	SITUATIONS)
Boundary	 situations	 represent	 the	 crises	 in
human	existence	in	which	conflict	and	its	meaning
become	 poignantly	 and	 tragically	 clear.	 Jaspers
(1932a,b,c)	emphasizes	death,	suffering,	struggle,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
708
chance,	guilt,	and	the	uncertainty	of	the	world,	and
two	 more	 general	 boundary	 situations—that	 of
the	 particular	 historical	 determination	 of	 the
individual’s	existence	and	that	of	the	relativity	of
all	that	is	real.	Other	authors	sometimes	refer	to
those	as	limit	situations.
Limit	 or	 boundary	 situations,	 such	 as	 the
knowledge	of	our	impending	death,	bring	us,	says
Jaspers,	 to	 illumination	 of	 our	 Existenz	 (if	 we	 let
them).	 This	 leads	 to	 our	 grasp	 of	 transcendence,
which	 is	 known	 only	 indirectly	 by	 what	 Jaspers
calls	“ciphers,”	such	as	myths	or	religions.	The	key
point	 for	 psychotherapists	 is	 that	 the	 human	 is
always	more	unknowable	and	indescribable	than
what	is	known	and	described.
Jaspers	argues	for	what	he	calls	“philosophical
faith,”	pointing	out	that	if	one	is	unwilling	to	have
philosophical	 faith,	 then	 one	 must	 hold	 that	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
709
immediate	 world	 is	 all	 there	 is,	 that	 the
individual’s	 destiny	 is	 fully	 determined,	 that
humans	are	imperfectable	and	alone,	and	that	the
world	is	self-supporting.	He	(1962,	1966)	tries	to
illustrate	 through	 study	 of	 the	 lives	 of	 the	 great
philosophers	
how	
they	
have	
dramatically
struggled	with	existential	questions	and	boundary
situations,	and	how	by	their	actual	lives	and	active
philosophizing	 they	 have	 illuminated	 the	 various
concepts	he	is	trying	to	get	across.
How	an	individual	deals	with	limit	situations	is
extremely	 important	 in	 psychotherapeutic	 work.
An	old	Japanese	saying	reminds	us	that	only	when
an	 individual	 is	 extremely	 desperate	 can	 we
become	 acquainted	 with	 that	 person’s	 true	 core.
This	is	quite	true	both	in	our	clinical	work	and	in
our	assessment	of	ourselves	and	others.

LISTENING
Freud’s	 (1912)	 technique	 of	 listening	 with
evenly	 suspended	 attention	 constitutes	 an	 effort
not	 to	 prescind	 from	 the	 patient’s	 material,	 in
order	 to	 prevent	 the	 therapist	 from	 making	 any
selection	out	of	preconceived	expectations.	Freud
wishes	to	avoid	the	danger	of	the	therapist	never
finding	 anything	 out	 that	 he	 or	 she	 does	 not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
711
already	know,	and	distorting	what	is	perceived	to
fit	experience-distant	theoretical	preconceptions.
The	 question	 of	 whether	 one	 can	 really	 give
such	equal	notice	to	everything	communicated	by
the	patient	has	often	been	raised,	but	only	recently
has	it	been	answered	increasingly	in	the	negative.
Many	experienced	therapists	by	now	have	learned
that	everyone	approaches	the	data	of	the	patient’s
free	 associations	 and	 behavior	 as	 manifested	 in
the	treatment	with	a	certain	mental	set,	one	that	is
based	 on	 either	 conscious	 or	 preconscious
theoretical	 and	 philosophical	 conceptions.	 This
mental	set	determines	what	is	perceived	and	what
is	 selected,	 regardless	 of	 the	 therapist’s	 effort	 to
listen	 with	 evenly	 suspended	 attention.	 All	 a
stance	of	evenly	suspended	attention	can	do	is	to
try,	in	a	deliberately	conscious	fashion,	to	reduce
the	influence	of	this	mental	set.	It	is	obvious	that
this	stance	is	enhanced	greatly	if	the	therapist	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
712
aware	of	his	or	her	preconceptions	and	how	these
influence	all	aspects	of	perception	of	the	patient.
A	typical	example	of	how	such	preconceptions
or	 preoccupations	 interfere	 is	 the	 insistence	 on
taking	full	notes	on	or	even	recording	a	patient’s
material.	It	is	far	better	to	take	notes	immediately
after	the	session	with	the	patient.	Or,	if	one	has	a
memory	 as	 prodigious	 as	 Freud’s,	 to	 write	 these
things	down	from	memory,	after	work	is	over.
Recording	 invariably	 interferes	 with	 the
production	of	the	patient’s	material.	It	represents
an	 unwarranted	 intrusion	 into	 the	 individual’s
privacy	and	encourages	exhibitionism	on	the	part
of	 the	 patient,	 as	 well	 as	 suspicion	 that	 the
material	 the	 patient	 produces	 is	 being	 used	 for
purposes	 other	 than	 the	 therapy	 itself—which	 is
usually	the	case.
Freud	 (1912)	 offers	 the	 famous	 telephone
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
713
receiver	analogy:
[The	
therapist]	
must	
turn	
his	
own
unconscious	 like	 a	 receptive	 organ	 towards
the	transmitting	unconscious	of	the	patient.
He	 must	 adjust	 himself	 to	 the	 patient	 as	 a
telephone	 receiver	 is	 adjusted	 to	 the
transmitting	microphone.	Just	as	the	receiver
converts	 into	 sound	 waves	 the	 electric
oscillations	in	the	telephone	line	which	were
set	 up	 by	 sound	 waves,	 so	 the	 doctor’s
unconscious	is	able,	from	the	derivatives	of
the	unconscious	which	are	communicated	to
him,	to	reconstruct	that	unconscious,	which
has	
determined	
the	
patient's	
free
associations,	[pp.	115-116]
He	goes	on	to	maintain	that	“if	the	doctor	is	to	be
in	a	position	to	use	his	unconscious	in	this	way	as
an	 instrument	 in	 the	 analysis,”	 he	 must	 have
“undergone	 a	 psycho-analytic	 purification”	 (p.
116).	 Otherwise	 the	 inevitable	 and	 innumerable
“complexes	 of	 his	 own”	 (p.	 116),	 even	 it	 the
therapist	 is	 apparently	 a	 successful	 person,
disqualify	the	therapist	from	practicing	intensive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
714
psychotherapy.	 Freud	 says:	 “There	 can	 be	 no
reasonable	doubt	about	the	disqualifying	effect	of
such	 defects	 in	 the	 doctor;	 every	 unresolved
repression	in	him	constitutes	what	has	been	aptly
described	by	Stekel	as	a	“blind	spot”	in	his	analytic
perception”	(p.	116).
It	 is	 clear	 from	 Freud’s	 writing	 that	 an
important	focus	of	psychoanalytic	listening,	if	one
includes	
both	
verbal	
and	
nonverbal
communication,	 is	 to	 become	 aware	 of	 the
nuances	 of	 the	 development	 of	 transference.	 As
Freud	repeatedly	remarks,	the	success	or	failure	of
a	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 rests	 primarily	 on	 the
identification	 and	 management	 of	 transference
phenomena.
In	 the	 process	 of	 psychoanalytic	 listening
Freud	 (1914)	 suggests	 that	 the	 therapist	 not
attempt,	at	least	at	the	beginning	of	treatment,	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
715
bring	 any	 particular	 moment	 or	 problem	 into
focus:	 “He	 contents	 himself	 with	 studying
whatever	 is	 present	 for	 the	 time	 being	 on	 the
surface	of	the	patient’s	mind,	and	he	employs	the
art	 of	 interpretation	 mainly	 for	 the	 purpose	 of
recognizing	 the	 resistances	 which	 appear	 there,
and	 making	 them	 conscious	 to	 the	 patient”	 (p.
147).
One	 of	 the	 most	 difficult	 resistances	 to	 deal
with	
in	
intensive	
psychotherapy	
and
psychoanalysis,	 says	 Freud	 (1914),	 occurs	 when
the	patient,	instead	of	remembering	what	has	been
repressed,	acts	it	out	either	within	or	outside	the
analytic	 situation:	 “He	 reproduces	 it	 not	 as	 a
memory	but	as	an	action;	he	repeats	it,	without,	of
course,	knowing	that	he	is	repeating	it”	(p.	150).
This	is	a	common	way	for	patients	to	“remember”
previous	 relationships.	 It	 is	 the	 task	 of	 the
therapist,	by	careful	listening,	to	become	aware	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
716
what	 is	 being	 repeated	 in	 the	 course	 of	 the
treatment,	 either	 in	 the	 relationship	 with	 the
therapist	 or	 in	 the	 development	 of	 relationships
with	others	outside	treatment	(see	ACTING	OUT).
Thus	all	descriptions	on	the	part	of	a	patient	about
current	 relationships,	 as	 well	 as	 dreams,	 need	 to
be	 listened	 to	 carefully	 for	 allusions	 to	 the
relationship	 with	 the	 therapist,	 and	 for	 the
repetition	 or	 displacement	 of	 disavowed	 aspects
of	 this	 relationship	 outside	 the	 consulting	 room.
Very	 important	 aspects	 of	 the	 transference	 often
appear	in	this	manner	and	are	easily	overlooked.
I	 have	 proposed	 elsewhere	 (see	 Chessick
1989)	that	we	approach	the	data	of	psychoanalytic
communication	
from	
five	
more	
or	
less
psychoanalytic	
models	
in	
turn,	
without
definitively	 assigning	 major	 preeminence	 to	 any
one	model	in	any	given	clinical	situation	until	after
we	have	been	at	least	open	to	examining	the	data
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
717
in	 detail	 from	 five	 points	 of	 view.	 Without	 this
approach,	 no	 material	 can	 be	 convincingly
understood	as	falling	under	the	rubric	of	a	given
model.
Clinical	 experience	 unfailingly	 demonstrates
two	 principles.	 The	 first	 is	 that	 a	 psychoanalytic
model	 is	 the	 only	 acceptable	 kind	 of	 model	 for
achieving	 depth	 understanding	 of	 a	 person.	 The
second	
is	
that	
one	
neglects	
Freud’s
drive/conflict/defense	 orientation	 at	 one’s	 peril.
Many	 alternative	 approaches	 have	 been	 devised
over	the	years	to	get	away	from	Freud’s	emphasis
on	
sexuality	
and	
aggression	
as	
ultimately
constituting	 the	 infantile	 core	 or	 fantasy	 life	 or
even	 the	 psychic	 reality	 of	 the	 adult,	 as	 well	 as
from	 his	 central	 focus	 on	 the	 Oedipus	 complex.
Many	cases	flounder	when	alternative	stances	are
used	 by	 the	 therapist	 for	 defensive	 purposes.	 To
avoid	this,	the	primary	model	in	approaching	any
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
718
patient	 material	 should	 be	 Freud’s	 “drive/
structure”	model	(Greenberg	and	Mitchell	1983);
furthermore,	 Freud’s	 dicta	 for	 psychoanalytic
listening	 should	 be	 followed	 whenever	 possible.
Any	 departure	 from	 this	 channel	 should	 be
tentative,	 and	 the	 problem	 of	 possible	 defensive
collusion	should	constantly	be	kept	in	mind.
We	 can	 begin	 listening	 from	 the	 channel	 of
Freud’s	
drive/conflict/	
defense	
orientation,
staying	 carefully	 tuned	 for	 derivatives	 of	 core
unconscious	infantile	fantasies	that	are	expressed
in	the	material	both	through	verbal	and	nonverbal
manifestations.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 we	 can	 allow
ourselves	 to	 be	 open	 to	 what	 Husserl	 (1913)
would	call	“imaginative	variations”	in	our	minds,
tentatively	 trying	 to	 fit	 the	 material	 into	 the
orientations	 of	 the	 other	 listening	 channels.	 The
material	 itself	 usually	 suggests	 what	 channel	 is
most	suitable	for	understanding	what	the	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
719
is	trying	to	communicate.	This	affords	a	temporary
fusion	 of	 horizons	 with	 the	 patient,	 as	 Gadamer
(1982)	 would	 characterize	 it	 (see	 FUSION	 OF
HORIZONS),	
and	
helps	
us	
to	
frame	
our
interventions	 in	 a	 language	 the	 patient	 will
understand.	But	we	must	always	keep	in	mind	that
sooner	 or	 later	 we	 are	 going	 to	 return	 to	 the
drive/conflict/defense	 model	 as	 the	 patient
develops	 trust	 in	 our	 empathy	 and	 reveals	 more
and	more	of	himself	or	herself	to	us.	Furthermore,
if	the	therapy	is	to	be	truly	psychoanalytic,	we	are
ultimately	 going	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 core	 infantile
fantasy	 derivatives	 as	 they	 are	 expressed	 in	 the
transference.
Our	understanding	of	the	patient	gained	from
these	various	channels	of	psychoanalytic	listening
can	then	be	translated	into	rational	interventions.
With	 careful	 listening,	 the	 patient’s	 response	 to
our	 interventions	 may	 serve	 as	 validation	 or
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
720
negation	of	the	correctness	of	our	understanding.
Each	 proposed	 channel	 of	 psychoanalytic
listening	 carries	 a	 stance	 about	 psychological
development,	 a	 view	 of	 psychic	 change,	 and
assumptions	 about	 the	 curative	 factors	 in
intensive	psychotherapy.	These	stances	contradict
each	
other	
in	
important,	
philosophically
fundamental	 ways	 and	 cannot	 at	 present	 be
reconciled,	
since	
they	
reflect	
profound
disagreement	about	the	nature	of	humans	and	the
nature	of	knowledge	itself.
The	 first	 model	 was	 presented	 by	 Freud	 and
focuses	on	the	Oedipus	complex	and	the	inevitable
emergence,	
in	
a	
properly	
conducted
psychoanalysis,	 of	 the	 need	 for	 drive	 satisfaction
in	 the	 transference.	 This	 enables	 us	 to	 study	 the
patient’s	 infantile	 conflicts	 and	 their	 subsequent
vicissitudes	 in	 terms	 of	 defenses	 against	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
721
instinctual	 drives	 and	 the	 resulting	 crucial
compromise	 formations	 produced	 by	 the	 ego	 in
dealing	 with	 its	 three	 harsh	 masters—the
superego,	the	id,	and	external	reality.	At	the	core
are	 the	 patient’s	 childhood	 or	 infantile	 fantasies,
derivatives	 of	 which	 repeat	 themselves	 over	 and
over	again	in	the	patient’s	mental	life	and	behavior
(Arlow	1985).	On	this	channel	we	carefully	listen
for	the	derivatives	of	these	fantasies	and	look	for
them	 to	 be	 reenacted	 or	 reexperienced	 in	 the
transference.
The	second	channel	utilizes	the	perspective	of
the	so-called	object-relations	theory	for	its	model.
The	work	of	Klein	and	Bion	focuses	on	the	earliest
projective	and	introjective	fantasies	of	the	patient
as	they	appear	in	the	object	relatedness	manifest
in	the	transference	and	in	the	process	of	projective
identification	 as	 it	 occurs	 in	 the	 analytic	 process
(see	 KLEIN).	 Bion	 (1963,	 1967)	 emphasizes	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
722
“toilet	 function”	 of	 the	 analyst,	 in	 which	 the
analyst	must	receive,	metabolize,	and	give	back	in
acceptable	 form	 the	 unacceptable	 fantasies	 and
affects	and	expressions	of	these	coming	from	the
patient	 (see	 REVERIE).	 This	 is	 of	 enormous
importance,	 especially	 in	 the	 treatment	 of
borderline	patients	(Waldinger	1987).
A	study	of	projective	identification	operating	in
the	 therapeutic	 process	 emphasizes	 the	 patient’s
earliest	 internalized	 object	 relations	 and	 yields
data	 about	 how	 the	 patient	 as	 an	 infant	 (if	 one
follows	Klein)	or	as	a	preoedipal	child	organized
these	relations	into	self	and	object	representations
and	 then	 projected	 and	 reintrojected	 various
aspects	 of	 these	 images	 (see	 PROJECTIVE
IDENTIFICATION).	
Understanding	
of	
these
processes	 clarifies	 the	 patient’s	 relationships	 in
the	 present	 because	 all	 such	 relationships	 are
perceived	and	reacted	to	through	the	spectacles	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
723
these	
early	
organized	
self	
and	
object
representations.	 Klein’s	 assumption	 is	 that	 the
infantile	ego	is	capable	of	such	organization.
A	third	channel,	which	focuses	on	the	patient’s
being-in-the-world,	is	the	phenomenological	point
of	view.	Here	an	attempt	is	made	to	grasp	the	facts
of	the	patient’s	life	“phenomenologically,”	that	is,
without	 other	 theoretical	 preconceptions	 to
organize	 the	 data.	 This	 approach	 was	 elaborated
in	 philosophy	 by	 Husserl	 and	 then	 differently	 by
Heidegger,	and	taken	up	especially	by	the	pioneer
psychoanalysts	 Boss	 (1963)	 and	 Binswanger
(1963).
The	
notion	
of	
phenomenology	
(see
PHENOMENOLOGY)	has	been	used	in	many	ways
and	 is	 very	 confusing.	 Husserl	 (1913)	 first	 used
the	 term	 in	 1900.	 For	 him	 the	 phenomenologic
method	 was	 a	 way	 of	 doing	 philosophy.	 A
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
724
phenomenon	
is	
whatever	
appears	
for	
us
immediately	in	experience.	Husserl’s	method	rests
on	what	he	calls	transcendental-phenomenological
reduction;	he	does	not	permit	the	selection	out	of
experience	of	certain	specific	sensations,	feelings,
and	
so	
on,	
since	
this	
already	
assumes
classificatory	 principles	 about	 the	 world.	 Thus
phenomenologic	 statements	 cannot	 be	 called
empirical	in	the	traditional	sense	since	empirical
statements	 are	 already	 about	 assumed	 “things”
out	 there.	 Phenomenologic	 statements	 attempt
what	Husserl	calls	presuppositionless	inquiry—no
theories,	 just	 descriptions	 of	 the	 phenomena	 as
they	present	themselves	to	an	unprejudiced	view.
From	the	point	of	view	of	the	psychotherapist,
the	phenomenologic	stance	is	just	to	react	to	what
is	simply	there	in	a	felt	experience;	one	does	not
disconnect	 or	 isolate	 or	 interpret	 aspects	 of	 this
experience.	 Epoche,	 phenomenological	 reduction,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
725
or	 the	 bracketing	 of	 being	 demand	 refrainment
from	 judgment	 about	 morals,	 values,	 causes,
background,	 even	 the	 subject	 (the	 patient)	 and
objective	 observer	 (the	 therapist).	 One	 pays
special	
attention	
to	
one’s	
own	
state	
of
consciousness	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 patient,	 for
example,	 “the	 feel”	 of	 a	 schizophrenic,	 the
ambience	such	an	individual	creates.
The	point	of	this	stance	is	to	keep	looking	and
listening	 in	 the	 so-called	 phenomenologic	 sense,
staying	right	with	the	material	of	the	patient	and
taking	 everything	 the	 patient	 has	 to	 say	 at	 face
value	rather	than	searching	for	hidden	processes.
This	
is	
derived	
from	
the	
practice	
of
phenomenological	 reduction.	 Phenomenologists
argue	 that	 a	 distance	 is	 opened	 between	 the
doctor	and	the	patient	by	the	analytic	technique	of
free	 association,	 a	 gap	 that	 may	 be	 filled
unproductively	 by	 abundant	 verbal	 material	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
726
analytic	ideas,	conceptions,	and	theories;	instead,
they	advise	proceeding	by	emotional	interchange
based	on	staying	strictly	with	the	phenomena	and
the	manifest	appearance	that	the	patient	presents.
Phenomenological	 reduction	 of	 the	 emotional
distance	 between	 the	 patient	 and	 the	 therapist,
then,	is	the	crucial	procedure	leading,	hopefully,	to
a	true	meeting	or	encounter	(Jaspers	1972).
The	 fourth	 listening	 stance	 is	 that	 of	 self
psychology	 (Kohut	 1971,	 1977,	 1984),	 which
focuses	 on	 the	 state	 of	 the	 patient’s	 self	 as	 it	 is
empathically	 grasped	 by	 the	 analyst	 (see	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).	 Important	 originators	 of	 this
approach	 were	 Fairbairn	 and	 Winnicott,	 who
introduced	the	notion	of	the	true	and	the	false	self.
Although	there	were	numerous	versions	of	the	self
already	 utilized	 in	 philosophy	 and	 psychology,	 it
was	Kohut	who	brought	the	focus	on	the	self	into	a
systematic	 and	 elaborate	 psychoanalytic	 theory.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
727
Significant	 alterations	 in	 this	 theory	 have	 been
offered	by	Gedo	(1979,	1984).	Although	he	rejects
some	of	Kohut’s	premises,	Gedo’s	establishment	of
hierarchies	 of	 self-organization	 represents	 a
further	 elaboration	 and	 movement	 away	 from
traditional	 psychoanalytic	 metapsychology,	 and
his	discussions	contain	arguments	and	proposals
with	 which	 every	 therapist	 ought	 to	 be	 familiar
(see	BEYOND	INTERPRETATION).
We	
can	
distinguish	
between	
cognitive
observations	
and	
empathic	
observations.
Cognitive	
observations	
are	
of	
verbal	
and
nonverbal	 behaviors	 as	 well	 as	 of	 subjective
reactions	of	the	therapist,	and	are	capable	of	being
consensually	
validated	
by	
other	
objective
observers.	Empathy,	on	the	other	hand,	is	defined
by	the	self	psychologists	Muslin	and	Val	(1987)	as
“a	 mode	 of	 observation	 that	 attempts	 to	 capture
the	 subject’s	 inner	 life”	 (p.	 5)	 and	 requires	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
728
observer	to	draw	out	of	himself	or	herself	a	state
or	experience	that	somewhat	approximates	that	of
the	subject.	These	assessments	allow	the	therapist
to	answer	such	questions	as	“What	is	the	patient
experiencing?”	 and	 “Where	 are	 these	 reactions
coming	from?”
The	 complexity	 and	 controversial	 aspects	 of
the	 empathic	 approach	 to	 data	 gathering	 have
been	 much	 discussed	 in	 philosophy	 and	 in	 the
psychotherapy	 literature.	 The	 systems	 of	 self
psychology	 and	 traditional	 psychoanalysis	 are
basically	 incompatible.	 Reed	 (1987)	 warns	 that
the	“classical	analyst	who	listens	only	to	resistance
and	 the	 self-psychologist	 who	 listens	 only	 to
material	relating	to	the	empathic	failure	of	a	self-
object	are	listening	to	theory,	not	to	the	patient”
(p.	 437).	 But	 all	 authors	 agree	 that	 the	 essential
task	is	listening.	Listening	requires	the	therapist	to
be	free	from	the	urges	to	do	or	to	say	something,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
729
which	runs	contrary	to	much	of	medical	training
and	to	our	prevailing	pragmatic	culture.	It	leaves
the	
problem	
of	
validation	
of	
empathic
observations	 to	 the	 internal	 process	 of	 the
treatment.
The	final	listening	stance	on	which	to	organize
the	transmission	from	the	patient	might	be	termed
the	
interactive,	
which	
focuses	
on	
the
countertransference	 of	 the	 therapist	 or,	 more
generally,	 on	 the	 here-and-now	 factors	 in	 the
treatment,	 emphasizing	 the	 role	 of	 the	 analyst’s
participation.	 Many	 of	 the	 conflicting	 points	 of
view	 placed	 under	 this	 rubric	 have	 been
developed	 as	 a	 response	 to	 our	 increasing
understanding	 of	 the	 patient’s	 need	 for	 an
experience	 and	 not	 just	 an	 explanation	 in	 the
treatment.	Modell	(1976)	offers	the	notion	of	the
psychoanalytic	 process	 in	 the	 early	 phase	 of	 the
treatment	 of	 narcissistic	 or	 schizoid	 patients	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
730
providing	a	“cocoon,”	a	holding	of	the	patient	until
he	 or	 she	 is	 ready	 for	 self-exploration.	 Langs
(1982)	 emphasizes	 the	 presence	 of	 delineated
interactive	 fields	 in	 which	 the	 data	 coming	 from
the	 patient	 are	 loaded	 with	 allusions	 to	 the
therapist’s	
participation,	
and	
even	
to	
the
therapist’s	 mental	 state.	 In	 this	 extreme	 but
carefully	
worked	
out	
view,	
the	
patient’s
unconscious	
is	
capable	
of	
perceiving	
the
therapist’s	personal	difficulties,	thus	allowing	the
therapist	to	be	cured	so	that	he	or	she	may	in	turn
cure	the	patient.
Gill	 (1982),	 in	 a	 less	 radical	 approach,
emphasizes	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 therapist’s
participation	
in	
determining	
the	
particular
transference	 manifestations	 that	 develop	 in	 a
given	
treatment.	
He	
also	
focuses	
his
interpretations	 on	 the	 here-and-now	 interaction
between	patient	and	therapist.	Gill’s	view	is	close
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
731
to	
Sullivan’s	
(1947,	
1953)	
more	
extreme
“interpersonal”	 theory	 of	 psychiatry,	 which
erroneously	 eschews	 Freud’s	 crucial	 concept	 of
“psychic	 reality”	 and	 attempts	 to	 study	 a
scientifically	
delineated	
interaction	
in	
the
treatment,	 one	 in	 which	 the	 therapist	 both
participates	 in	 and	 observes	 the	 interaction.
Sullivan’s	 approach	 suffers	 from	 a	 certain
metapsychological	 shallowness	 because	 of	 its
emphasis	 on	 the	 interactional	 without	 sufficient
study	 of	 the	 filtering	 mechanism	 constituted	 by
intrapsychic	fantasy	configurations	through	which
the	patient	inevitably	experiences	this	interaction.
Sullivan’s	concept	of	parataxic	distortion	attempts
to	 make	 up	 for	 this,	 but	 it	 has	 not	 received
widespread	acceptance.
Focus	on	the	current	interaction	between	the
patient	and	the	therapist	reveals	that	Freud’s	early
advocacy	of	neutrality	and	opacity	to	the	patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
732
represents	 a	 theoretical	 impossibility.	 It	 can	 be
demonstrated	 easily	 that	 even	 in	 his	 own	 work
Freud	did	not	follow	these	precepts.	It	is	likely	that
Freud’s	 papers	 on	 technique	 were	 aimed	 at
preventing	 massive	 acting	 out	 by	 incompletely
analyzed	or	even	unanalyzed	therapists	with	their
patients,	 as	 was	 common	 in	 the	 early	 days	 of
psychoanalysis	and	remains	all	too	common	with
much	less	justification	today.
My	view	differs	significantly	from	that	of	Gedo
and	 Goldberg	 (1973)	 in	 that	 their	 principle	 of
“theoretical	complementarity”	(p.	4)	assumes	that
the	different	frames	of	reference,	or	models	of	the
mind,	 operate	 only	 as	 long	 as	 no	 internal
contradictions	 arise	 among	 the	 various	 parts	 of
the	theory.	They	believe	that	even	Freud	did	not
intend	 to	 dispense	 with	 his	 older	 conceptions	 as
he	 went	 forward	 to	 propose	 new	 ones,	 and	 that
the	changeover	from	one	set	of	Freud’s	concepts
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
733
to	 another	 did	 not	 have	 to	 indicate	 that	 one
replaced	or	superseded	the	other.
However,	
in	
my	
approach,	
theoretical
orientations	 are	 being	 utilized	 that	 directly
conflict	with	each	other	and	cannot	be	thought	of
as	complementary	because	the	basic	premises	that
underlie	
them,	
both	
their	
epistemological
foundations	 and	 their	 basic	 assumptions	 about
human	 nature	 and	 its	 motivations,	 collide
(Chessick	
1992).	
This	
forces	
a	
radical
discontinuity	as	we	shift	from	channel	to	channel
in	 our	 receiving	 instrument,	 rather	 than,	 as	 we
would	 all	 prefer	 to	 do,	 sliding	 back	 and	 forth
between	 theoretically	 consistent	 positions,	 or	 at
least	complementary	positions	that	are	consistent
with	each	other.
The	
worst	
mistake	
a	
beginner	
in
psychoanalytic	listening	can	make	at	this	historical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
734
point	in	the	development	of	psychoanalytic	theory
is	 to	 assume	 that	 in	 some	 fashion	 these	 five
standpoints	
can	
be	
blended	
into	
some
supraordinate	 theory	 that	 can	 generate	 all	 of
them.	Careful	examination	of	the	premises	of	these
standpoints	reveals	that	this	is	impossible	in	our
current	state	of	knowledge.	If	we	use	this	shifting
of	 systems,	 we	 are	 forced	 to	 accept	 the	 radical
discontinuities,	 much	 in	 the	 way	 the	 early
physicists	had	to	accept	the	fact	that	certain	data
involving	 light	 rays	 were	 better	 explained	 by	 a
wave	 theory	 whereas	 other	 data	 were	 best
explained	by	a	corpuscular	theory,	and	these	two
theories	 were	 radically	 incompatible	 in	 the
prevailing	state	of	scientific	understanding	at	the
time.	The	problem	in	the	human	sciences	is	even
more	 profound,	 and	 some	 thinkers	 such	 as
Foucault	(1973)	have	claimed	that	in	principle	no
agreement	 can	 ever	 be	 reached	 on	 a	 single
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
735
theoretical	 model	 for	 scientific	 understanding	 of
all	human	mentation	and	behavior.
Other	 clinicians	 may	 insist	 that	 certain
theoretical	 approaches	 should	 be	 added	 to	 these
channels.	 The	 most	 important	 requirement	 of	 a
model	is	that	it	be	suggested	by	the	very	data	the
patient	produces	rather	than	be	superimposed	on
the	 data	 by	 experience-distant	 or	 arbitrary	 or
mystical	 or	 dogmatic	 prior	 conceptions	 in	 the
mind	 of	 the	 therapist.	 This	 is	 a	 relative	 concept
because	no	theory	is	truly	experience-near,	since	it
is	impossible	to	approach	data	without	some	prior
conceptions.	Our	only	hope	is	that	our	conceptions
are	 not	 too	 abstract,	 generalized,	 and	 divorced
from	 the	 specific	 material,	 and	 that	 they	 are
capable	of	being	validated	by	a	study	of	how	the
patient	responds	to	interventions.	Even	this	may
be	difficult,	as	it	is	all	too	human	to	hear	what	we
wish	to	hear.	Hence	the	value	of	consultation	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
736
of	 the	 presentation	 of	 the	 details	 of	 therapist-
patient	exchanges	in	case	reports.
The	hardest	part	in	using	this	approach	is	to	be
willing	 to	 keep	 discontinuous	 and	 conflicting
models	in	one’s	mind.	This,	however,	offends	the
natural	and	very	dangerous	human	tendency	for	a
neat,	
consistent,	
and	
holistic	
theoretical
explanation	of	all	material,	even	if	it	is	wrong.	Kant
(1781)	called	this	mental	tendency	the	regulative
principle	 of	 reason,	 Bacon	 called	 it	 “idols	 of	 the
tribe”	(see	IDOLS),	and	Freud	would	have	based	it
on	the	powerful	synthesizing	function	of	the	ego.
Tolerance	and	flexibility	on	the	part	of	the	listener,
as	well	as	a	certain	maturity,	are	required,	and	this
can	be	very	difficult	to	achieve.
The	 advantage	 is	 a	 greater	 understanding	 of
the	
patient	
and	
a	
capacity	
to	
render
interpretations	 and	 interventions	 suitable	 to	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
737
developmental	 stage	 and	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the
patient	 at	 any	 given	 time.	 As	 the	 patient
experiences	 the	 therapist’s	 understanding	 and
communication	 at	 a	 level	 he	 or	 she	 finds
meaningful,	 trust	 is	 increased	 and	 the	 ego	 is
strengthened,	
allowing	
the	
patient	
to
communicate	 more	 derivatives	 of	 the	 infantile
fantasy	 life	 and	 receive	 greater	 depth	 of
psychoanalytic	understanding.

LOVE
Although	 Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 offered
fourteen	definitions	of	love,	Freud	(1930)	mused
that	human	love	is	the	only	thing	that	may	make
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
741
sense	out	of	the	absurd	condition	of	the	existential
world.	 Yet	 for	 Freud	 love	 was	 essentially	 a
derivative	 of	 sex.	 According	 to	 Freud	 (1930),
“Normally,	there	is	nothing	of	which	we	are	more
certain	than	the	feeling	of	our	self,	of	our	own	ego”
(p.	 65).	 In	 passionately	 falling	 in	 love,	 however,
ego	and	object	libido	cannot	be	distinguished:	“At
the	height	of	being	in	love	the	boundary	between
the	ego	and	object	threatens	to	melt	away.	Against
all	 evidence	 of	 his	 senses,	 a	 man	 who	 is	 in	 love
declares	that	‘I’	and	‘you’	are	one,	and	is	prepared
to	behave	as	if	it	were	a	fact”	(p.	66).
Viederman	 (1988)	 tells	 us,	 “One	 of	 the	 most
powerful	aspects	of	a	new	passionate	relationship
is	the	formation	of	a	new	sense	of	self’	(p.	9).	He
claims	 that	 the	 love	 experience	 helps	 us	 to
understand	 what	 we	 can	 expect	 from	 our	 body
and	 what	 we	 can	 expect	 our	 body	 to	 do.	 He
believes	 that	 the	 unconscious	 illusion	 of	 at	 least
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
742
some	 gratification	 of	 early	 infantile	 wishes
occurring	in	requited	love	allows	an	individual	to
approximate	 aspects	 of	 the	 ego-ideal	 from
childhood.
Many	authors,	including	Freud,	seem	to	agree
that	in	the	experience	of	passionate	love	there	is	a
temporary	 intense	 gratification,	 or	 at	 least	 the
illusion	 of	 potential	 gratification,	 of	 powerful
archaic	 infantile	 desires	 that	 have	 long	 been
frustrated	 and	 repressed.	 This	 leads	 to	 what
Viederman	 (1988)	 calls	 “a	 euphoric	 sense	 of
fullness,”	 (p.	 10)	 or	 what	 other	 authors	 have
described	as	the	sense	of	power	and	extraordinary
exaltation	that	goes	along	with	achieving	requited
passionate	love.
Viederman	 also	 notes	 that	 passionate	 love
allows	one	to	escape	the	constraints	of	reality	as
one	finds	oneself	in	a	passionate	embrace.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
743
Viederman	 stresses	 the	 illusion	 aspects	 of
passionate	love,	but	he	does	not	wish	to	devalue	it
on	this	account,	because	he	admits	that	once	it	is
experienced	 and	 reciprocated,	 it	 is	 the	 closest
thing	to	what	he	considers	ever-elusive	happiness.
This	 is	 close	 to	 the	 Freudian	 concept	 that	 the
greatest	 happiness	 consists	 of	 the	 preferably
sudden	gratification	of	long	dammed	up	infantile
wishes.	To	this	Viederman	adds	the	importance	of
being	 able	 to	 be	 one’s	 true	 self	 in	 the	 lover’s
presence	and	of	having	one’s	true	self	accepted	by
the	lover.	This	intense	mirroring	obviously	has	a
powerful	effect	on	the	cohesion	of	the	self.
One	unanswered	question	is	whether	falling	in
love	 and	 being	 in	 love	 can	 be	 explained
metapsychologically	as	a	formation	expressing	the
sexual	drive.	Certainly	it	is	a	complex	experience
and	definitely	not	just	a	pathological	regression	in
order	to	achieve	the	“oceanic	feeling”	and	a	sense
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
744
of	blissful	fusion	with	the	mother	of	infancy.
Passionate	 love	 can	 be	 set	 in	 motion	 by	 the
state	of	flux	and	instability	indigenous	to	the	late
adolescent	 phase,	 but	 somewhat	 paradoxically
also	 in	 middle	 age	 by	 the	 relentless	 and	 leaden
repetition	 of	 experience.	 For	 the	 middle-aged
individual,	 says	 Viederman	 (1988),	 “It	 is	 easy	 to
see	how	the	search	for	change,	the	search	for	the
new,	 the	 search	 for	 mystery	 can	 lead	 to	 a
passionate	experience	that	will	act	as	a	powerful
antidote	 to	 frustration,	 disappointment,	 and
repetition”	(p.	12).	Looking	at	the	matter	from	the
point	of	view	of	self	psychology	(Kohut	1977),	the
search	for	a	passionate	love	experience	in	middle
age	 is	 better	 explained	 by	 the	 increased
narcissistic	 wounding	 that	 inevitably	 takes	 place
as	 the	 individual	 realizes	 that	 he	 or	 she	 is	 not
going	 to	 reach	 cherished	 goals	 and	 ideals.
Passionate	
love	
can	
restore	
the	
damaged
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
745
narcissistic	 equilibrium	 in	 these	 situations	 by
achieving	a	fusion	with	the	projected	infantile	ego-
ideal,	even	if	it	is	an	illusion	and	only	temporary.
As	 Kohut	 (1977)	 writes,	 “There	 is	 no	 love
relationship	
without	
mutual	
(self-esteem
enhancing)	mirroring	and	idealization”	(p.	122n).	I
(Chessick	1985,	1989a,	1990b)	believe	this	to	be
an	 important	 clue	 in	 understanding	 the	 sad
situation	 of	 the	 aging	 therapist	 “falling	 in	 love”
with	his	or	her	patient,	as	described,	for	example,
by	Dahlberg	(1970).
For	 Viederman	 (1988),	 passionate	 love	 must
inevitably	 diminish,	 yet	 it	 can	 be	 a	 growth
experience.	 He	 views	 it	 as	 “an	 entirely	 personal
and	 a	 subjective	 experience”	 (p.	 13),	 one	 that
depends	on	the	individual’s	fantasies,	wishes,	and
memories.	Thus	no	accurate	general	definition	of
passionate	 love	 can	 be	 obtained:	 “When	 one
experiences	 passion	 one	 is	 never	 sure	 of	 how
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
746
much	 it	 approximates	 the	 experience	 of	 the
partner”	 (p.	 13).	 This	 has	 important	 clinical
ramifications,	since	a	patient’s	declaration	of	love
for	 the	 therapist	 may	 have	 an	 entirely	 different
meaning	than	what	the	therapist	assumes.
One	of	the	most	remarkable	phenomenological
descriptions	of	the	state	of	falling	in	love	has	been
presented	 by	 the	 Italian	 sociologist	 Francesco
Alberoni	 (1983).	 He	 points	 out	 the	 close
relationship	
between	
the	
great	
collective
movements	 of	 history	 and	 falling	 in	 love.	 The
forces	they	liberate	involve	similar	experiences	of
solidarity,	joy	and	life,	and	renewal.	There	is	the
birth	of	a	new	collective	“we”	constructed	out	of
two	or	more	individuals,	as	when	two	people	fall
in	 love.	 In	 an	 existing	 social	 structure	 this	 may
divide	whoever	was	united	and	unite	whoever	was
divided	 to	 form	 a	 new	 collective	 subject:	 “The
forces	 that	 operate	 in	 both	 cases	 have	 the	 same
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
747
violence	and	the	same	determination”	(p.	6).
Alberoni	 (1983)	 points	 out	 the	 distinction
between	“ordinary	sexuality”	in	our	everyday	life
and	the	“extraordinary	sexuality”	that	appears	in
the	 situation	 of	 passionate	 love.	 This	 distinction
has	not	been	stressed	sufficiently	in	the	literature.
During	 the	 sexual	 activity	 of	 passionate	 lovers,	 a
new	 vital	 energy	 is	 often	 released	 and	 there	 are
new	explorations	of	“the	frontiers	of	the	possible,
the	 horizons	 of	 the	 imaginary	 and	 of	 nature”	 (p.
13).	 The	 lovers	 are	 in	 what	 Alberoni	 calls	 a
“nascent	 state,”	 in	 which	 “eros	 overflows	 the
structures	 and	 floods	 prohibited	 territories”	 (p.
23).
Alberoni,	like	many	other	authors,	stresses	the
long	preparation	period	before	this	occurs,	which
may	 be	 characterized	 by	 increasing	 depression
and	a	slow	deterioration	in	relations	with	previous
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
748
love	 objects.	 He	 insists	 that	 the	 experience	 of
falling	in	love	originates	in	an	extreme	depression,
an	 inability	 to	 find	 something	 that	 has	 value	 in
everyday	life,	the	well-known	existential	malaise,
“the	 profound	 sense	 of	 being	 worthless	 and	 of
having	nothing	that	is	valuable	and	the	shame	of
not	having	it”	(p.	69).	This	can	happen	at	any	age
and	 is	 characterized	 by	 the	 “irreparable	 loss	 of
something	 in	 the	 self,	 a	 feeling	 that	 we	 will
inevitably	 become	 devoid	 of	 value	 or	 degraded,
compared	 with	 what	 we	 have	 been”	 (p.	 69).	 The
experience	 of	 romantic	 love	 becomes	 one	 of
liberation,	fullness	of	life,	and	happiness,	in	which
all	 alienation	 is	 temporarily	 extinguished.	 Thus,
for	example,	when	a	creative	person	falls	in	love,
he	 or	 she	 becomes	 more	 and	 more	 creative	 and
increases	his	or	her	capacity	to	enrich	life	with	the
fruits	 of	 imagination.	 Alberoni	 points	 out	 that
“artists,	poets	and	scientists	live	in	the	imaginary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
749
universe	they	have	created,	and	when	they	fall	in
love,	they	tend	to	transport	the	person	they	love	to
this	world	of	theirs”	(p.	65).
The	mystery	of	passionate	love	is	that	it	does
not	 go	 with	 marriage,	 but	 rather,	 historically
speaking,	 it	 is	 often	 associated	 with	 thoughts	 of
death	 or	 at	 least	 the	 longing	 for	 death.	 Thus,
although	 passionate	 love	 may	 represent	 at	 some
level	 the	 wish	 for	 union	 with	 incestuous	 objects
and	 the	 overcoming	 of	 one’s	 infantile	 sense	 of
inferiority	to	the	parental	objects,	there	still	seems
to	be	an	ultimate	goal—permanent	fusion	in	some
eternal	 fashion	 in	 another	 world—consistently
associated	 with	 it.	 This	 points	 to	 the	 deeper
preoedipal	roots	of	passionate	love	or	to	evidence
of	man’s	inherent	search	for	transcendence.
Bergmann	 (1982)	 emphasizes	 Freud’s	 (1905)
statement	 that	 “all	 finding	 is	 refinding”	 (p.	 202).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
750
By	this	Freud	meant	the	inevitable	finding	in	adult
love	of	the	infantile	love	object.	Freud	mistrusted
sexual	 passion	 as	 a	 basis	 for	 marriage.	 So,	 for
example,	in	1931	he	claimed	that	first	marriages,
based	 on	 falling	 passionately	 in	 love,	 are	 often
disappointing,	 while	 second	 marriages,	 assumed
to	 be	 more	 dispassionately	 chosen	 and	 more
practically	 determined,	 turn	 out	 better.	 Whether
this	is	true	or	not	remains	highly	debatable.
For	
Freud,	
tender	
feelings	
are	
always
transformed	sexual	feelings.	But	Bergmann	(1982)
adds,	“In	real	life	many	traumatized	patients	fall	in
love	 not	 with	 the	 person	 who	 reminds	 them	 of
their	 parent,	 but	 with	 the	 person	 they	 hope	 will
heal	the	wound	the	parental	figures	have	inflicted.
To	fall	in	love	with	the	rescuer	or	the	person	one
has	rescued	is	a	frequent	theme	of	romantic	love.
It	is	also	an	important	source	of	transference	love”
(p.	107).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
751
Hitschmann	(1952)	notes	that	Freud	discusses
love	130	times	in	his	collected	writings,	yet	he	is
not	 consistent	 about	 the	 subject	 and	 seems
therefore	 basically	 ambivalent	 and	 uncertain
about	the	matter	of	passionate	love.	Freud	(1912)
explained	 that	 the	 affectionate	 and	 sensual
currents	had	to	become	properly	fused	to	produce
the	 normal	 attitude	 in	 love.	 For	 Freud,	 both	 of
these	 currents	 are	 derived	 from	 the	 sexual
instinctual	 drives:	 the	 affectionate	 current	 has
aim-inhibited	 goals	 and	 the	 sensual	 current	 an
openly	 erotic	 intent.	 Altman	 (1977)	 emphasizes
the	ego	and	superego	aspects	of	the	experience	of
love	 and	 points	 out	 that	 love	 requires	 good	 ego
and	superego	functioning—it	is	far	more	than	the
discharge	of	libido.
Altman	agrees	with	Freud	(1921)	that	there	is
a	hostile	residue,	repressed,	in	each	love	affair	that
can	 cause	 considerable	 difficulty.	 He	 (1977)	 also
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
752
believes	 that	 behind	 the	 wish	 to	 die	 “is	 the
unconscious	wish	for,	expectation	of,	and	belief	in
life	everlasting	in	reunion	with	the	love	objects	of
childhood”	 (p.	 44).	 This	 points	 again	 to	 the
ceaseless	 effort	 to	 make	 good	 the	 loss	 of	 the
preoedipal	object,	which,	as	Bak	(1973)	explains,
results	 in	 a	 never-ending	 quest	 for	 love.	 Altman
believes	 that	 such	 love	 is	 doomed	 since	 it	 is
founded	on	depression	and	the	unconscious	wish
for	a	reunion	with	the	mother	of	infancy.
Freud	(1921)	describes	the	idealization	of	the
love	 object,	 which	 he	 believed	 to	 diminish	 with
each	sexual	satisfaction.	For	Freud,	being	in	love	is
based	 on	 the	 simultaneous	 presence	 of	 directly
sexual	 impulsions	 and	 of	 sexual	 impulsions	 that
are	inhibited	in	their	aims,	while	the	object	draws
a	 part	 of	 the	 subject’s	 narcissistic	 ego	 libido	 to
itself.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
753
Bergmann	 (1988)	 summarizes	 Freud’s	 views
on	love	into	three	theories.	The	first,	expressed	in
the	 Three	 Essays	 on	 Sexuality	 (Freud	 1905),
stresses	 the	 finding	 of	 the	 love	 object	 as	 a
refinding	of	the	infantile	love	object.	The	second,
in	 the	 paper	 “On	 Narcissism”	 (1914),	 describes
love	 as	 a	 massive	 transformation	 of	 narcissistic
libido	 into	 object	 libido	 with	 a	 subsequent
depletion	of	the	ego-ideal.	The	third,	in	the	paper
“Instincts	
and	
Their	
Vicissitudes”	
(1915),
deemphasizes	 the	 instinctual	 component	 and
depicts	love	as	a	relation	of	the	“total	ego”	to	its
object,	without	any	clear	definition	of	“total	ego.”
An	important	correction	to	Freud’s	discussion
of	the	problem	of	love	has	been	made	by	a	number
of	 authors,	 such	 as	 Chasseguet-Smirgel	 (1970).
Contrary	 to	 Freud’s	 pronouncement,	 one’s	 ego-
ideal	 is	 not	 depleted,	 but	 there	 is	 an	 increased
libidinal	 investment	 of	 the	 self	 that	 accompanies
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
754
the	 experience	 of	 being	 in	 love,	 as	 even	 Robert
Louis	Stevenson	(1988)	remarkably	described	it:
It	seems	as	if	he	had	never	heard	or	felt	or
seen	until	that	moment;	and	by	the	report	of
his	memory,	he	must	have	lived	his	past	life
between	sleep	and	waking.	...	a	very	supreme
sense	of	pleasure	in	all	parts	of	life—in	lying
down	 to	 sleep,	 in	 waking,	 in	 motion,	 in
breathing,	 in	 continuing	 to	 be—the	 lover
begins	to	regard	his	happiness	as	beneficial
for	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 world	 and	 highly
meritorious	in	himself,	[pp.	8-9]
Person	(1988)	points	out	that	the	capacity	for
passionate	love	is	inherent	in	human	nature,	and
that	both	females	and	males	seek	to	achieve	this
extraordinary	state.	Flashes	of	the	possibility	of	a
passionate	 love	 developing	 with	 this	 or	 that
individual	that	crosses	our	path	keep	occurring	to
us,	 similar	 to	 flashes	 of	 sexual	 desire	 or	 fantasy.
Passionate	love	is	“a	perpetual	possibility	waiting
to	be	born”	(p.	264),	but	these	flashes	are	usually
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
755
immediately	 discounted	 by	 the	 realistic	 situation
in	 which	 there	 is	 not	 only	 no	 chance	 of
reciprocation	 but	 usually	 the	 danger	 of	 a
humiliating	 rejection.	 Unless	 there	 is	 some	 hope
that	 one’s	 love	 may	 encounter	 a	 less	 stringent
response,	 the	 flashes	 suffer	 the	 same	 fate	 as
fleeting	sexual	fantasies.
In	 the	 psychoanalytic	 situation,	 where	 the
analyst	 is	 neither	 encouraging	 nor	 rejecting,	 and
certainly	does	not	condemn	or	belittle	the	patient
for	 his	 or	 her	 feelings,	 passionate	 love	 can	 be
allowed	 to	 flourish	 and	 does	 so	 much	 more
frequently	 than	 in	 ordinary	 life.	 This	 gives	 us	 an
opportunity	 to	 study	 the	 patient	 in	 depth	 if	 the
proper	empathic	and	analytic	stance	is	maintained
by	the	therapist.
Person	locates	the	source	of	passionate	love	in
our	 early	 lives,	 following	 Freud,	 and	 sees	 it	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
756
related	 to	 the	 play	 of	 the	 imagination	 and	 the
springs	 of	 our	 creativity.	 She	 views	 it	 as
potentially	transforming	and	transcending	the	self,
but	 opines	 that	 a	 mysterious	 leap	 is	 involved	 in
falling	 in	 love,	 similar	 to	 a	 religious	 conversion.
When	 this	 “leap”	 occurs,	 there	 is	 always	 a
heightened	 drama	 and	 sense	 of	 self-awareness
and,	when	the	love	is	reciprocated,	we	experience
a	sense	of	intermittent	transcendence	and	merger,
with	the	“oceanic”	feeling	as	a	typical	result.
When	this	happens,	values	and	priorities	may
become	reordered,	new	projects	undertaken,	new
responsibilities	assumed.	This	profound	change	in
the	 self	 may	 last	 even	 after	 the	 passionate	 love
affair	 has	 passed	 (Chessick	 1992).	 Thus	 Person
emphasizes	the	creative	and	positive	potential	of
passionate	love,	a	state	that	is	discontinuous	with
the	rest	of	our	lives	and	can	be	a	major	agent	of
change	 even	 outside	 the	 transference	 love	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
757
psychoanalytic	 experience.	 Some	 people	 manage
to	 allow	 such	 love	 to	 flourish	 for	 a	 long	 period,
especially	
if	
there	
are	
obstacles	
to	
its
consummation,	 which	 permit	 the	 individual	 to
experience	 intervals	 of	 merger	 and	 surrender
while	at	the	same	time	preserving	autonomy.	On
the	whole	this	approach	to	love	views	it	as	an	ego
function,	 an	 act	 of	 the	 creative	 imagination,	 in
contrast	 to	 Freud’s	 more	 id-related	 explanation
involving	a	refinding	of	incestuous	objects.	But	it
also	preserves	the	concept	of	a	“mysterious	leap,”
a	leap	that	is	better	understood	by	other	authors
quoted	above,	beginning	with	Freud.
This	 mysterious	 leap	 occurs	 when	 certain
conditions	are	met.	The	first	of	these	is	indeed	the
safety	 requirement	 of	 not	 anticipating	 the
certainty	 of	 serious	 narcissistic	 wounding	 if	 one
manifests	 one’s	 love.	 The	 totally	 inappropriate
appearance	 of	 passionate	 love	 suddenly	 in	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
758
situation	that	clearly	indicates	it	will	be	rejected,
often	 cruelly	 and	 scornfully,	 demonstrates	 very
poor	 reality	 testing	 in	 the	 lover.	 At	 best,	 such
declared	
infatuation	
indicates	
a	
severe
masochistic	disorder;	at	worst,	it	is	not	uncommon
in	schizophrenia.
The	 second	 condition	 is	 some	 association	 in
the	 lover’s	 mind	 of	 the	 beloved	 with	 either	 an
incestuous	love	object	or	an	object	from	childhood
invested	 with	 healing	 and	 soothing	 power—a
selfobject,	 or	 both,	 as	 in	 the	 case	 of	 Tristan	 and
Isolde	 (Chessick	 1990a).	 Or	 at	 least	 there	 is	 the
imaginative	hope	that	the	beloved	will	transform
into	 such	 an	 object,	 given	 the	 proper	 persuasion
and	 seduction.	 Arlow	 (1980)	 elaborates	 on	 this
condition,	 maintaining	 that	 “in	 every	 love
relationship	the	individual	acts	out	some	form	of
complicated	 unconscious	 fantasy	 rooted	 in	 early
vicissitudes	 of	 drive	 and	 object	 experience,	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
759
fantasy	 that	 ultimately	 determines,	 but	 only	 in
part,	the	pattern	of	loving	and	the	specific	person
or	 types	 of	 persons	 that	 will	 correspond	 object
choice”	(p.	27).
The	third	condition	is	that	of	the	activity	of	the
creative	 imagination.	 There	 has	 to	 be	 a	 problem
situation	that	calls	for	creative	imagination,	such
as	a	loss	that	must	be	ameliorated	or	a	depletion	of
middle	age	that	is	becoming	unbearable.	The	leap,
then,	is	one	of	the	imagination	where	the	illusion
is	created	that	the	beloved	object	will	be	able	to
perform	all	these	roles,	and	passionately,	so	there
will	be	a	sudden	release	of	dammed	up	narcissistic
and	 sexual	 tensions	 that	 have	 accumulated
sometimes	 for	 many	 years.	 This	 creative	 leap
triggers	 the	 idealization	 and	 obsession	 with	 the
beloved,	 and	 explains	 the	 exaltation	 and	 ecstasy
when	the	love	is	reciprocated.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
760
Kohut	(1978)	points	out,	“People	whose	self	is
in	 need	 of	 sustenance,	 whether	 because	 of	 the
energic	 drain	 and	 anxiety	 during	 a	 creative	 spell
or	 for	 other	 reasons,	 will	 tend	 to	 establish
narcissistic	 relationships	 to	 archaic	 selfobjects—
whether	 in	 the	 form	 of	 one	 of	 the	 varieties	 of	 a
mirror	transference	or	through	a	merger	with	an
idealized	 imago”	 (p.	 813n).	 He	 convincingly
demonstrates	
that	
in	
periods	
of	
intensive
creativity	a	similar	archaic	selfobject	transference
occurs	 to	 those	 seen	 in	 the	 psychoanalytic
situation,	a	“transference	of	creativity”	(p.	814).	It
follows	 from	 this	 that	 creativity	 enhances	 the
tendency	to	idealization	needed	in	falling	in	love,
and	 falling	 in	 love	 enables	 the	 actualization	 of
one’s	potential	for	creativity	since	it	lends	strength
to	a	self	that	would	otherwise	be	enfeebled	by	the
creative	process.
This	is	not	so	mysterious,	and	can	be	depicted
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
761
in	 metapsychological	 terms.	 Furthermore,	 the
length	 of	 the	 passion	 can	 be	 understood	 as	 a
function	 of	 the	 capacity	 of	 the	 lover	 to	 maintain
the	illusion	in	his	or	her	creative	imagination	for
an	indefinite	length	of	time,	and	of	the	degree	of
their	proximity	and	time	spent	together.	Some	of
us	have	a	greater	capacity	to	regress	in	the	service
of	 the	 ego	 than	 others,	 to	 maintain	 illusions	 and
idealizations	longer,	and	to	engage	in	a	play	space
in	 our	 fantasy-lives.	 Freud	 already	 pointed	 out
that	with	each	sexual	act	the	degree	of	idealization
of	 the	 loved	 one	 diminishes—perhaps	 he	 was
speaking	 from	 his	 own	 experience.	 But	 certainly
familiarity	makes	it	harder	and	harder	to	maintain
idealization,	 whereas	 partings	 and	 obstacles	 fan
the	flames	of	illusion	by	keeping	the	reality	of	the
beloved	 in	 a	 shadow	 and	 making	 it	 easier	 to
project	our	wishes	and	fantasies	onto	him	or	her.
That	is	why	passionate	love	is	often	thought	of	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
762
incompatible	with	marriage,	and	often	fades	after
the	familiarity	of	marriage	into	either	an	enduring
affection	or	a	parting	of	ways.	In	Freud’s	terms,	the
passionate	or	“lyrical”	phase	of	love	is	replaced	by
a	 calmer,	 more	 rational,	 more	 durable	 “epic”
phase.
Similarly,	 in	 the	 state	 of	 heightened	 creative
imagination	 and	 expanded	 play	 space	 during
passionate	love	there	is	an	enhanced	potential	to
create	in	other	areas	of	one’s	life	(Gediman	1975).
New	 values,	 projects,	 dreams,	 even	 artistic
compositions	
may	
abound.	
The	
increased
cohesiveness	 of	 the	 self	 as	 a	 function	 of	 the
mirroring	from	the	beloved	can	also	lead	to	better
ego	functioning,	greater	achievement,	heightened
joy	 in	 life,	 and	 an	 enhanced	 sense	 of	 being	 alive.
This	 transformation	 is	 no	 mystery	 and	 can	 be
understood	in	metapsychological	terms,	stressing
ego	 apparatuses	 and	 self	 psychology.	
The
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
763
debatable	 assumption	 I	 (Chessick	 1989b)	 am
making	in	this	formulation	is	that	ego	psychology
and	
self	
psychology	
can	
comfortably	
or
uncomfortably	 exist	 side	 by	 side	 (see	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).
But	 what	 of	 the	 longing	 for	 death	 at	 the
moment	 of	 ecstatic	 union?	 Why	 is	 the	 long-
awaited	 consummation	 often	 associated	 with
death	rather	than	life	and	companionship?	Could
this	 be	 due	 to	 guilt	 over	 breaking	 the	 incest
barrier?	 Or	 would	 the	 final	 consummation	 of	 life
secretly	 longed	 for	 be,	 indeed,	 the	 return	 to	 the
inorganic?	Was	Freud	right	after	all	that	the	quest
for	nirvana	is	the	fundamental	human	impulse	and
beyond	the	pleasure	principle?
Falling	in	love	cannot	simply	be	explained	as	a
refinding	of	incestuous	parental	objects,	although
this	is	always	an	important	basic	element	in	falling
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
764
in	 love	 and	 object	 choice,	 as	 Freud	 said.	 What
makes	falling	in	love	unique	for	each	individual	is
the	 specific	 ego	 functions	 involved	 in	 the	 act	 of
creative	imagination	that	each	person	uses,	falling
in	 love	 in	 a	 specific	 way	 to	 solve	 specific
intrapsychic	difficulties.	Falling	in	love	represents
a	creative	effort	to	find	a	solution	for	unbearable
narcissistic	 and	 libidinal	 tensions,	 often	 in	 an
emergency	 situation	 of	 object	 loss	 or	 narcissistic
wounding.	Depending	on	the	nature	of	this	effort,
the	 falling	 in	 love	 can	 be	 a	 constructive,	 helpful,
and	 forward-moving	 event,	 or	 it	 can	 lead	 to
destruction	 and	 tragedy.	 But	 no	 generalizations
can	be	made	about	the	function	of	falling	in	love
beyond	the	fact	that	it	tends	to	occur	when	there	is
a	serious	problem	to	be	solved.	These	problems	of
unbearable	 tension	 can	 range	 from	 the	 revived
Oedipus	
conflict	
that	
occurs	
in	
normal
adolescence,	 as	 well	 as	 from	 the	 preoedipal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
765
pathology	
that	
suffers	
a	
resurgence	
in
adolescence,	 to	 old	 age,	 where	 problems	 of	 loss,
loneliness,	 and	 despair	 can	 predominate.	 Any
variety	 of	 these	 problems	 is	 a	 challenge	 for
solution	 by	 the	 ego;	 one	 of	 the	 solutions	 that	 is
possible	is	the	creative,	imaginative	act	of	falling	in
love.
The	 phenomenon	 of	 falling	 in	 love	 only
becomes	 intelligible	 when	 one	 views	 it	 as
motivated	 by	 libidinal	 energies	 and	 narcissistic
disequilibrium	 and	 molded	 into	 a	 compromise
that	is	consistent	with	the	historical	and	cultural
horizons	 of	 the	 individual,	 so	 that	 it	 clearly
incorporates	 the	 unique	 superego-	 and	 ego-
functioning	aspects	of	that	individual.	This	is	true
even	 if	 one	 emphasizes	 the	 “oceanic	 feeling”	 or
altered	consciousness	or	“aberrant”	experience	in
requited	
passionate	
love.	
Werman	
(1986)
convincingly	 argues	 that	 such	 experiences	 in	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
766
adult	 cannot	 be	 simple	 replays	 of	 an	 infantile
experience,	 but	 instead	 represent	 “a	 complex
phenomenon	 that	 derives	 from	 all	 aspects	 of	 the
psyche,	 including	 the	 subject’s	 value	 system	 and
the	 influences	 of	 his	 culture”	 (p.	 123).	 With	 self
psychological	 understanding	 of	 the	 problems	 in
maintaining	 narcissistic	 equilibrium,	 the	 extreme
exaltation	accompanying	requited	passionate	love
is	 no	 longer	 a	 mysterious	 or	 quasi-psychotic
phenomenon;	 rather,	 it	 represents	 both	 Freud’s
concept	of	rapid	gratification	of	long	dammed	up
infantile	 wishes,	 or	 at	 least	 the	 illusion	 of	 such
gratification,	 and	 a	 powerful	 force	 toward	 the
cohesion	
of	
the	
sense	
of	
self	
with	
the
accompanying	
joyful	
experience	
that	
such
improved	 cohesiveness	 of	 the	 self	 brings	 to	 the
individual.
The	mystery	of	falling	in	love	lies	only	in	the
debate	about	the	relationship	between	passionate

love	and	death.	If	the	preoedipal	roots	of	falling	in

MANIC	DEFENSE
This	represents	a	set	of	fantasies	or	a	type	of
behavior	 that	 can	 protect	 the	 individual	 from
anxiety,	 guilt,	 and	 depression.	 Denial	 is	 the
principal	means	of	defense,	often	accompanied	by
a	fantasy	of	omnipotent	power	and	control	with	a
euphoric	affect.	The	individual	may	identify	with
sources	of	power	and	project	undesirable	aspects
of	himself	or	herself	onto	others.	The	price	of	the
manic	 defense	 is	 a	 superficiality	 of	 thought	 and
personality	and	a	loss	of	the	capacity	to	emphasize
with	other	people.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
772
In	
Kleinian	
theory	
manic	
defenses
characteristically	 appear	 during	 the	 depressive
position	(see	DEPRESSIVE	POSITION).	The	pain	of
the	depressive	position	can	occur	throughout	life
and	the	manic	defense	can	be	utilized	at	any	time
to	 relieve	 this	 pain;	 this	 is	 often	 observed	 in
clinical	work.	Denial,	disparagement,	contempt	for
what	 is	 lost,	 a	 false	 sense	 of	 control,	 and
idealization	 accompanied	 by	 identification	 with
the	 idealized	 object	 may	 result	 in	 a	 sense	 of
triumph	 over	 the	 situation.	 Klein	 (1975)	 stated
that	the	manic	defenses	evolved	out	of	obsessional
defenses	that	were	employed	to	bind	persecutory
anxiety.	 She	 wrote,	 “I	 wish	 to	 stress	 the
importance	 of	 triumph,	 closely	 bound	 up	 with
contempt	and	omnipotence”	(p.	351).
For	 Klein,	 mania	 represents	 a	 triumph	 in
phantasy	over	the	loss	of	the	object,	the	basic	fear
of	the	depressive	position.	Mania	is	characterized
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
773
by	omnipotence,	which	represents	a	denial	of	need
for	 the	 object	 and	 of	 any	 attacks	 on	 it;	 an
identification	with	a	sadistic	superego	in	which	the
external	objects	are	depreciated	with	contempt	or
devaluation	 by	 projection	 of	 bad	 parts;	 object
hunger—life	is	a	feast,	so	who	cares	if	a	few	are
eaten;	triumph	over	a	dead	and	dying	universe	of
depression;	or	even	an	exaltation	in	which	there	is
extreme	 idealization	 and	 identification	 with
idealized	internal	and	external	objects	leading	to
messianic	 states.	 In	 patients	 with	 manic	 and
depressive	 symptoms	 no	 secure	 good	 internal
object	
has	
been	
established.	
The	
various
mechanisms	described	are	all	used	to	preserve	the
shaky,	 good	 internal	 object	 and	 protect	 it	 from
destruction	 by	 aggression	 of	 bad	 internalized
objects.	 There	 is	 a	 consequent	 failure	 to	 work
through	or	resolve	the	depressive	position.
The	 use	 of	 manic	 defenses,	 which	 are	 quite
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
774
common	
and	
appear	
repeatedly	
in
psychotherapeutic	 work,	 should	 not	 be	 confused
with	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 bipolar	 disorder.	 The
diagnostic	 criteria	 for	 a	 bipolar	 disorder	 are
outlined	in	DSM-III-R	(1987),	and	the	treatment	of
bipolar	
disorders	
usually	
requires
psychopharmacological	
intervention.	
The
temporary	 appearance	 of	 mild	 manic	 defenses
does	not	require	immediate	psychopharmacologic
intervention	 but	 is	 an	 indication	 for	 interpretive
work.	
It	
is	
assumed	
that	
the	
practicing
psychotherapist,	 regardless	 of	 his	 or	 her	 basic
training,	 is	 thoroughly	 conversant	 with	 the
standard	disorders	as	they	are	delineated	by	DSM-
III-R	 and	 will	 not	 mix	 up	 the	 presence	 of	 these
standard	
disorders	
with	
various	
transitory
regressive	 maneuvers	 that	 occur	 in	 the	 normal
course	
of	
intensive	
psychotherapy	
or
psychoanalysis.

MASCULINITY
Since	 the	 earliest	 times	 there	 has	 been	 a
general	assumption	that	a	collection	of	anatomical
and	 personality	 traits	 are	 characteristic	 of	 each
sex;	 for	 Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773),	 to	 be	 masculine
meant	to	be	“virile.”	It	has	usually	been	assumed
that	 this	 collection	 of	 personality	 traits	 is
correlated	 with	 anatomy	 and	 is	 biological	 in
origin.	 Freud	 equated	 masculinity	 with	 activity
and	 femininity	 with	 passivity,	 but	 he	 recognized
eventually	 that	 this	 equation	 was	 a	 false
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
776
generalization.	At	present	it	seems	uncertain	and
controversial	as	to	whether	any	of	the	personality
characteristics	that	have	been	labeled	“masculine”
and	“feminine”	are	biological	in	origin	or	whether
individuals	 develop	 their	 sense	 of	 identity	 in
response	 to	 the	 gender	 role	 that	 is	 assigned	 to
them	from	birth	by	the	particular	culture	in	which
they	live	(see	FEMALE	PSYCHOLOGY).

masculine	
psychological	
core
correlated	 with	 the	 possession	 of	 a	 penis	 and	 a
feminine	 core	 correlated	 with	 female	 anatomy
remains	highly	debated.	This	is	inextricably	mixed
up	with	the	issue	of	discrimination	against	women

identity,	the	sense	of	being	a	member	of	one	or	the
other	 sexes	 that	 is	 established	 by	 the	 end	 of	 the
third	 year	 of	 life;	 sexual	 behavior	 and	 fantasies
involving	the	choice	of	sexual	object	and	the	type
of	 activity	 preferred;	 and	 culturally	 determined
attributes,	 including	 identifications	 with	 the

MASOCHISM
Leopold	Von	Sacher-Masoch	was	a	nineteenth-
century	Austrian	novelist	whose	characters	derive
sexual	 pleasure	 from	 being	 cruelly	 treated.	 For
example,	his	Venus	in	Furs	(1947)	is	the	story	of	a
man	 whose	 major	 desire	 was	 to	 be	 the	 cruelly
tortured	slave	of	the	woman	he	adores,	with	the
ultimate	 end	 to	 achieve	 the	 sensation	 of	 being
whipped	 by	 a	 successful	 rival	 before	 the	 eyes	 of
the	adored	woman.	To	this	character,	a	whipping
rather	than	sexual	mastery	of	the	woman	was	the
primary	 drive	 of	 his	 life.	 The	 author	 argues	 that
every	woman	is	cruel	in	love	and	always	between
man	and	woman,	one	will	be	the	hammer	and	one
the	anvil.	The	furs	are	the	symbol	of	tyranny	and
cruelty	that	is	the	essence	of	woman.
Freud	(1919,	1924)	distinguished	three	kinds
of	masochism.	Moral	masochism	is	an	unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
779
trend	to	seek	pain	and	enjoy	suffering	as	the	result
of	a	desire	for	punishment	that	is	a	guilty	reaction
to	 forbidden	 wishes	 from	 the	 ego.	 Feminine
masochism	is	the	unconscious	wish	in	women	to
be	sexually	abused	and	impregnated	against	their
will.	 Erotogenic	 masochism	 is	 a	 form	 of	 sexual
gratification	and	remains	as	a	residue	of	the	death
instinct.
Feminine	masochism	was	described	by	Freud
as	a	characteristic	passivity	and	receptivity	of	the
feminine	 nature,	 but	 his	 followers	 (see	 Roazen
1975)	 extended	 this	 to	 a	 more	 extreme	 wish	 for
rape,	impregnation,	and	parturition.	According	to
Lampl-de-Groot,	 Brunswick,	 and	 Deutsch,	 the
essence	 of	 women	 consists	 of	 masochism,
passivity,	and	the	wish	for	a	baby	as	a	substitute
for	 a	 penis.	 Elsewhere	 I	 (Chessick	 1984)	 have
suggested	 that	 these	 conclusions	 were	 based	 on
the	study	of	pathological	women	and	represent	an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
780
unwarranted	 generalization	 about	 women	 in
general.	
The	
whole	
concept	
of	
feminine
masochism	 is	 questionable	 and	 may	 well	 be	 an
unwarranted	concept.
In	pathological	situations,	it	is	preoedipal	envy
and	aggression	against	the	mother	and	sometimes
the	father	that	makes	later	penis	envy	(see	ENVY)
critical	 and	 disturbs	 the	 girl’s	 oedipal	 period
(Blum	1976).	Guilt	or	fear	of	retaliation	over	this
aggression	 may	 even	 inhibit	 the	 libido	 entirely.
This	 guilt	 is	 bypassed	 in	 rape	 fantasies,	 and	 the
aggression	is	discharged	in	masochistic	fantasies,
commonly	 seen	 in	 the	 patients	 of	 Freud	 and	 his
“pioneer”	 women	 psychoanalysts.	 The	 mistake
was	 to	 generalize	 from	 this	 to	 statements	 about
normal	 feminine	 development,	 as	 Horney	 and
even	 Jones	 immediately	 objected	 (see	 FEMALE
PSYCHOLOGY).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
781
Kohut	 (1978)	 maintained	 that	 there	 is	 no
general	 validity	 to	 the	 idea	 that	 a	 woman’s	 wish
for	a	child	is	reducible	to	her	wish	for	a	penis.	He
argued	that	the	healthy	woman’s	wish	for	a	child	is
a	 manifestation	 of	 her	 nuclear	 self,	 her	 central
ambitions	
and	
ideals,	
channeled	
toward
motherhood	when	a	convergence	of	biological	and
cultural	 factors	 gives	 this	 defined	 content	 to	 a
woman’s	 self-expressive	 needs.	 So	 the	 healthy
self-esteem	
of	
a	
female	
baby	
mirrored
empathically	 by	 the	 adult	 selfobject	
leads
ultimately	to	the	joyful	wish	of	the	grown	woman
to	 have	 babies,	 depending	 on	 whether	 hormonal
stimulation	 and	 the	 cultural	 milieu	 support	 this
wish	or	not.
In	
the	
not-empathically-responded-to
depressed	female	baby,	older	girl,	and	ultimately
woman,	 the	 wish	 for	 a	 baby	 represents	 the
attempt	to	stimulate	herself	in	order	to	feel	alive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
782
and	so	represents	a	striving	to	cure	a	disturbance
of	her	self.	The	failure	to	have	a	baby	in	such	cases
is	experienced	as	shortcomings	of	body	parts—no
penis—	 and	 the	 frustration	 of	 “drives.”	 Behind
penis	 envy	 lies	 the	 child’s	 experiences	 of	 the
flawed	 personalities	 of	 the	 selfobjects	 who	 were
unable	to	respond	empathically	to	the	needs	of	her
self	in	its	early	formation.
For	Kohut,	the	so-called	drive	characterized	as
penis	 envy	 represents	 an	 attempt	 to	 fill	 in	 the
structural	 defects	 that	 form	 as	 a	 consequence	 of
the	lack	of	responses,	by	turning	to	hypercathexis
of	 body	 parts	 to	 be	 stimulated	 and	 to	 feel	 alive.
The	craving	for	a	penis	here	represents	an	intense
need	 to	 fill	 in	 a	 structural	 defect	 in	 the	 self
consequent	 on	 early	 narcissistic	 injury	 and
deprivation	 of	 necessary	 empathic	 mirroring
acceptance.	The	lowered	self-esteem	and	chronic
bitterness	and	rage	arise	out	of	this.	The	tendency
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
783
is	 then	 to	 blame	 gross	 events,	 such	 as	 the
discovery	 of	 the	 lack	 of	 a	 penis,	 which	 serve	 as
crystallization	points	for	future	pathology.
In	men,	masochism	is	generally	more	disguised
and	 less	 acceptable	 in	 fantasy,	 but	 masochistic
perversions	 are	 more	 commonly	 reported	 in
males.	There	is	no	evidence	that	innate	masochism
is	 greater	 in	 women	 than	 in	 men,	 and	 the
appearance	 of	 it	 in	 female	 fantasies	 or	 male
perversions	carries	no	messages	about	“essences”
of	 male	 or	 female.	 In	 general,	 the	 roots	 of	 later
sadomasochism	 lie	 in	 pregenital	 conflicts	 and
heightened	 aggression	 associated	 with	 infantile
trauma	 and	 disturbed	 object	 relations	 (Panel
1956,	Schafer	1974).
Freud’s	
earliest	
hypothesis	
was	
that
masochism	 represented	 a	 turning	 of	 sadism
against	the	self,	but	his	later	hypothesis	was	that	it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
784
represented	 a	 residue	 of	 the	 death	 instinct	 (see
DEATH	 INSTINCT).	 In	 the	 latter	 view,	 Freud
(1924)	 contended	 that	 there	 was	 a	 primary
erotogenic	 masochism,	 most	 of	 which	 was
removed	by	projecting	a	portion	of	it	out	towards
objects	in	the	external	world	in	the	phenomenon
of	 sadism.	 This	 is	 a	 forerunner	 of	 the	 whole
structure	of	Kleinian	theory;	both	Freud	and	Klein
agreed	that	sometimes	the	projected	sadism	was
introjected,	 leading	 to	 a	 form	 of	 secondary
masochism	in	which	the	sadism	is	turned	on	the
self.
Reik	
(1941),	
agreed	
with	
Freud	
that
masochism	 is	 based	 on	 the	 death	 instinct.	 Reik
observed	 a	 special	 significance	 to	 fantasy	 that	 is
crucial	in	both	the	masochist	and	exhibitionist,	a
ritual	 quality	 to	 the	 rigid	 rule	 and	 order	 that
govern	 the	 masochistic	 scene	 and	 establish	 its
erotic	 value.	 He	 noted	 the	 importance	 of	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
785
voluptuous	 expectation	 of	 pain	 that	 vacillates
between	pleasure	and	anxiety.	In	a	sense,	anxiety
becomes	 an	 element	 of	 the	 pleasure.	 The
masochist	masters	the	anxiety	by	flight	toward	the
future,	argued	Reik;	to	escape	fear	of	punishment
and	 humiliation,	 the	 masochist	 arranges	 them
himself	or	herself.	Reik	noted	the	relation	between
exhibitionism	and	masochism,	since	the	suffering
is	 often	 displayed,	 and	 between	 sadism	 and
masochism,	 since	 the	 individual	 tries	 to	 force
another	person	to	be	cruel.
The	 area	 of	 greatest	 agreement	 in	 the
unresolved	 issue	 of	 masochism	 is	 that	 forms	 of
moral	masochism	certainly	are	clinically	common.
In	 fact,	 the	 need	 for	 punishment	 out	 of
unconscious	guilt	may	form	a	serious	resistance	to
success	
in	
intensive	
psychotherapy	
or
psychoanalysis	and	must	be	carefully	watched	for
and	 analyzed	 when	 it	 appears.	 The	 well-known
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
786
negative	therapeutic	reaction	can	be	a	function	of
this,	in	which	a	correct	interpretation	is	followed
not	 by	 relief,	 but	 by	 an	 exacerbation	 of	 the
presenting	 symptomatology	 and	 suffering	 (see
NEGATIVE	 THERAPEUTIC	 REACTION).	 It	 is	 a
common	 clinical	 error	 to	 blame	 relapses	 or
increased	
severity	
of	
the	
patient’s
symptomatology	
on	
a	
negative	
therapeutic
reaction,	but	the	therapist	must	be	careful	not	to
overlook	the	possibility	that	he	or	she	has	made	a
wrong	interpretation	or	in	some	way	has	injured
or	humiliated	the	patient	that	could	account	for	a
malignant	turn	in	the	treatment.	It	is	also	clinically
important	to	distinguish	between	masochism	as	a
sexual	 perversion	 and	 masochistic	 elements	 in
behavior	 that	 are	 much	 more	 widespread	 and
subtle.
Freud	believed	that	moral	masochism	rests	on
a	wish	for	punishment	at	the	hands	of	the	father.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
787
This	is	a	regressive	distortion	of	the	wish	to	have	a
passive	 or	 feminine	 sexual	 relationship	 with	 the
father.	 According	 to	 Freud	 (1928),	 Dostoevsky’s
very	 strong	 destructive	 instinct,	 especially	 his
aggression	 toward	 his	 father,	 might	 easily	 have
made	 him	 a	 criminal.	 Instead	 it	 was	 directed
mainly	 against	 his	 own	 person.	 Freud	 regarded
Dostoevsky’s	 epilepsy	 as	 hystero-epilepsy,	 not	 a
truly	 organic	 epilepsy.	 This	 reaction	 is	 at	 the
disposal	of	the	neurosis	and	attempts	by	somatic
means	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 amounts	 of	 excitation	 that	 it
cannot	
deal	
with	
psychically.	
Dostoevsky’s
affective	
epilepsy	
began	
with	
feelings	
of
impending	 death,	 which	 Freud	 interpreted	 as
punishment	 for	 his	 death	 wish	 to	 his	 father	 and
identification	with	the	hopefully	dead	parent.	This
in	turn	was	seen	as	secondary	to	Dostoevsky’s	fear
of	 his	 feminine	 attitude	 toward	 his	 father.	 The
seizures,	 which	 were	 punishment	 for	 the	 death
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
788
wish,	
stopped	
in	
Siberia	
when	
the	
czar
administered	
the	
unconsciously	
needed
punishment.
This	 analysis	 also	 explains	 Dostoevsky’s
masochistic	 identification	 with	 criminals	 and	 his
need	to	ruin	himself	by	compulsive	gambling.	For
Freud,	 the	 gambling	 further	 represented	 a
manifestation	of	Dostoevsky’s	urge	to	masturbate,
an	 urge	 connected	 with	 his	 latent	 sexual	 wishes
toward	his	father.	Scholars	today	generally	agree
that	 the	 story	 of	 the	 “murder”	 of	 Dostoevsky’s
father	on	which	Freud’s	argument	rests	is,	at	best,
unproven;	most	scholars	(Snow	1978)	agree	that
his	father	died	of	apoplexy	(see	DIALOGUE).
Freud’s	(1919)	important	paper	that	involves
the	issue	of	masochism	is	entitled	“A	Child	Is	Being
Beaten.”	From	his	experience	Freud	believed	that
this	fantasy	begins	in	boys	who	have	a	masochistic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
789
wish	 to	 be	 beaten	 by	 the	 father;	 as	 in	 Freud’s
(1918)	case	of	the	Wolf-Man,	this	wish	represents
a	 defense	 against	 homoerotic	 wishes	 for	 the
father.	 This	 may	 shift	 into	 the	 fantasy	 of	 a	 boy
being	beaten	by	a	woman	(mother).	In	girls,	three
phases	 are	 involved.	 The	 first	 and	 originally
conscious	desire	is	the	girl’s	nonsexual	wish	that
her	father	beat	another	child	of	whom	the	girl	was
jealous.	 This	 is	 followed	 in	 the	 unconscious	 by	 a
change	 to	 the	 masochistic	 pleasurable	 fantasy	 of
the	girl	herself	being	beaten	by	the	father;	finally,
in	 the	 conscious	 fantasy	 that	 emerges,	 a	 child	 is
being	 beaten	 by	 a	 stranger.	 Thus	 the	 beating
affords	 punishment	 to	 absolve	 the	 guilt	 for	 the
incestuous	 wish	 and	 also	 provides	 a	 regressive
substitute	for	it	(see	BEATING	FANTASY).
The	 fantasy,	 sometimes	 accompanied	 by
masturbation,	begins	to	appear	even	before	school
age.	 It	 is	 clearly	 connected	 to	 the	 genesis	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
790
perversions.	The	Wolf-Man	also,	before	the	onset
of	the	phobia,	developed	a	behavior	disorder;	its
primary	 aim	 was	 to	 provoke	 the	 father	 into
beating	him.	This	represented	a	masochistic	form
of	gratification	that	rested	on	the	same	premises
as	the	“child	is	being	beaten”	fantasy.
The	 sadistic	 aspect	 is	 important.	 Thus	 in	 the
first	 phase	 of	 the	 girl’s	 beating	 fantasy,	 the	 real
phrase	 should	 be	 “My	 father	 is	 beating	 the	 child
whom	I	hate.”	This	switches	in	the	second	phase	to
the	masochistic	“I	am	being	beaten	by	my	father.”
A	 third	 phase	 is	 simply	 the	 vague	 conscious
derivative	 “A	 child	 is	 being	 beaten,”	 while	 the
patient	 looks	 on.	 The	 first	 phase	 gratifies	 the
child’s	jealousy	and	represents	the	assurance	that
father	loves	only	her.	The	second	phase	represents
the	girl’s	sense	of	guilt	over	her	incestuous	love	for
her	father	and	includes	a	regressive	substitute	for
that	love.	Freud	claims	that	in	the	third	phase,	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
791
fact	that	the	child	being	beaten	is	inevitably	a	boy
indicates	 that	 in	 girls	 there	 is	 a	 wish	 to	 identify
with	the	boy	and	to	possess	a	penis.
In	his	paper	Freud	expresses	the	hope	that	the
origins	 of	 all	 perversions	 in	 childhood	 can	 be
found	 through	 study	 of	 the	 vicissitudes	 of	 the
Oedipus	 complex	 (see	 OEDIPUS	 COMPLEX).	 He
writes,	“In	this	way	the	beating-fantasy	and	other
analogous	 perverse	 fixations	 would	 also	 only	 be
precipitates	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex,	 scars,	 so	 to
say,	left	behind	after	the	process	has	ended,	just	as
the	notorious	‘sense	of	inferiority’	corresponds	to
a	narcissistic	scar	of	the	same	sort”	(p.	193).	In	this
passage	 and	 in	 a	 further	 paragraph	 Freud
recognizes	
the	
narcissistic	
aspect	
of	
the
perversions.
He	 describes	 how	 repression	 transforms
sadism	into	masochism	in	three	ways:	“It	renders
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
792
the	 consequences	 of	 the	 genital	 organization
unconscious,	 compels	 that	 organization	 itself	 to
regress	 to	 the	 earlier	 sadistic-anal	 stage,	 and
transforms	
the	
sadism	
of	
this	
stage	
into
masochism,	which	is	passive	and	again	in	a	certain
sense	narcissistic”	(p.	194).
It	 is	 interesting	 to	 compare	 this	 statement	 to
Kohut’s	(1971)	discussion	of	phase-inappropriate
disappointment	 in	 the	 idealized	 parent	 imago
during	 the	 late	 preoedipal	 stage	 of	 development.
The	
narcissistic	
blow	
consequent	
to	
this
disappointment	 leads	 to	 a	 resexualization	 of
pregenital	 drives	 and	 derivatives,	 leading	 to	 the
formation	 of	 perversions	 in	 fantasy,	 or	 as	 acted
out,	 or	 both.	 On	 this	 theory,	 which	 postulates	 a
separate	 line	 of	 development	 for	 narcissism,	 the
appearance	of	the	“child	is	being	beaten”	fantasy
in	 the	 preschool	 child	 would	 in	 some	 cases	 be	 a
signal	
of	
narcissistic	
injury	
of	
a	
phase-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
793
inappropriate	 magnitude	 in	 the	 late	 preoedipal
stage	of	development,	rather	than	a	vicissitude	of	a
pathological	 resolution	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex
itself.
Before	the	wolf	dream,	in	addition	to	behavior
designed	 to	 provoke	 beating	 by	 the	 father,	 the
Wolf-Man	 had	 fantasies	 in	 which	 boys	 were
beaten,	 especially	 on	 the	 penis.	 That	 the
administrator	of	the	beating	was	a	woman	is	not
mentioned	by	Freud	(1918)	in	his	case	report;	this
substitution	has	been	explained	as	a	distortion	so
that	 the	 fantasy	 may	 attain	 acceptance	 in	 the
conscious	 mind.	 In	 the	 final	 conscious	 fantasy,
then,	the	boy	changes	the	sex	of	the	person	doing
the	beating	so	that	a	woman	is	beating	a	boy;	the
girl	changes	the	sex	of	the	person	being	beaten	so
that	a	man	is	beating	a	boy.
Freud’s	 (1917)	 comment	 on	 “A	 Childhood
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
794
Recollection”	
from	
Goethe’s	
Dichtung	
und
Wahrheit	 indicates,	 as	 in	 the	 “child	 is	 being
beaten”	fantasy,	the	bitterness	children	feel	about
the	 expected	 or	 actual	 appearance	 of	 a	 rival
sibling.	 In	 this	 case,	 Goethe’s	 memory	 of	 having
thrown	 all	 his	 dishes,	 pots,	 and	 pans	 out	 the
window	 is	 interpreted	 by	 Freud	 as	 a	 violent
expression	of	the	wish	to	get	rid	of	the	hated	rival
sister	 or	 brother.	 This	 behavior	 has	 a	 similar
motivation	to	that	of	the	beating	fantasy	in	girls,	in
the	 first	 phase	 of	 which	 another	 child	 is	 being
beaten.	 Many	 other	 acts	 of	 naughtiness	 or
destructiveness	in	children	can	be	interpreted	in
the	 same	 way:	 as	 reflecting	 the	 wish	 to	 be	 the
undisputed	 darling	 of	 the	 mother	 and	 father.
Freud	 (1917)	 adds,	 “If	 a	 man	 has	 been	 his
mother’s	
undisputed	
darling	
he	
retains
throughout	 life	 the	 triumphant	 feeling,	 the
confidence	 in	 success,	 which	 not	 seldom	 brings
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
795
actual	success	along	with	it”	(p.	156);	one	wonders
if	he	is	talking	about	Goethe	or	Freud,	especially
since	he	first	said	this	in	a	footnote	added	in	1911
to	The	Interpretation	of	Dreams	(Freud	1900).	At
any	rate,	it	is	clear	that	the	Wolf-Man’s	rivalry	with
his	 sister	 was	 intense,	 and	 an	 additional
explanation	of	his	naughty	behavior	certainly	lies
in	 this	 rivalry.	 The	 privileged	 status	 of	 being
Professor	Freud’s	famous	patient	represented	the
Wolf-Man’s	ultimate	triumph	over	his	sister.

MASTERY,	INSTINCT	FOR
A	 number	 of	 authors	 (Hendrick	 1948)	 have
attempted	 to	 get	 around	 the	 arguments	 Freud
presents	 for	 the	 death	 instinct	 (see	 DEATH
INSTINCT)	 by	 postulating	 instead	 an	 instinct	 for
mastery.	This	is	an	effort	to	explain	the	repetition
compulsion	as	an	innate	need	to	master	a	situation
by	 repeating	 it	 over	 and	 over	 again	 (see
COMPULSION	TO	REPEAT).	Although	the	concept
has	 a	 superficial	 appeal,	 it	 is	 totally	 inconsistent
with	the	rest	of	Freud’s	psychoanalytic	theory	and
actually	has	some	similarity	to	the	work	of	Adler,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
798
which	 is	 generally	 discredited	 as	 superficial	 and
simplistic.	 Adler’s	 writings	 represent	 a	 wrongful
concretization	of	Nietzsche’s	metaphysical	concept
of	the	“will	to	power.”
The	 concept	 of	 an	 instinct	 to	 mastery	 is	 not
consistent	 with	 any	 of	 Freud’s	 definitions	 of
“instinct”	 (see	 INSTINCT),	 and	 should	 not	 be
appealed	to	in	psychoanalytic	theory.

MASTURBATION
Masturbation	 is	 a	 conscious	 or	 preconscious
self-stimulation	 of	 the	 genitals	 that	 may	 or	 may
not	 produce	 orgasm	 but	 does	 produce	 sexual
pleasure.	 It	 is	 universal	 and	 occurs	 at	 all	 ages	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
799
both	
sexes.	
The	
earlier	
difficulties	
with
masturbation	 in	 clinical	 work	 referred	 mainly	 to
the	 tremendous	 guilt	 that	 it	 raised	 in	 various
individuals	 who	 were	 brought	 up	 to	 believe	 that
masturbation	 was	 morally	 wrong,	 would	 cause
them	 some	 physical	 damage,	 or	 would	 lead	 to
insanity.	 The	 latter	 two	 ideas	 were	 strongly
supported	by	many	impressive	medical	“experts”
in	the	nineteenth	century.
Largely	 through	 the	 influence	 of	 Freud,
discussion	 of	 masturbation	 has	 become	 much
more	open	in	clinical	work	and	masturbation	has
become	 a	 more	 acceptable	 form	 of	 behavior	 in
private,	either	individually	or	between	consenting
individuals.	 Still,	 many	 individuals	 object	 to
masturbation	 on	 religious	 grounds.	 On	 the	 other
hand,	 compulsive	 masturbation	 has	 little	 to	 do
with	sexuality	and	is	primarily	aimed	at	relief	of
depression	and	anxiety	or	the	reassurance	that	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
800
the	case	of	the	male	castration	has	not	occurred.
The	focus	in	psychoanalytic	treatment	today	is
on	 the	 issue	 of	 the	 fantasies	 that	 accompany	 the
masturbatory	 act.	 There	 is	 no	 longer	 much
discussion	 of	 the	 guilt	 over	 masturbation	 except
perhaps	 in	 religious	 individuals	 and	 among
adolescents,	but	an	understanding	of	the	specific
nature	of	masturbation	fantasies	is	very	important
as	part	of	the	“royal	road	to	the	unconscious”	that
is	
traditionally	
constituted	
by	
dreams.
Masturbation	fantasies,	like	all	others,	represent	a
compromise	 formation	 between	 the	 instinctual
drives	and	the	defensive	activities	of	the	ego;	they
are	highly	erotized	and	often	give	an	indication	of
the	 levels	 of	 psychosexual	 development	 where
there	 have	 been	 difficulties	 or	 fixations,	 or	 they
point	 to	 the	 level	 of	 development	 to	 which	 the
patient	has	regressed.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
801
The	
topic	
of	
masturbation	
and	
the
masturbation	fantasies	must	be	approached	with
great	
tact	
in	
psychotherapeutic	
work.
Investigation	
of	
the	
patient’s	
masturbatory
activities	
and	
masturbation	
fantasies	
can
constitute	a	mode	of	acting	out	on	the	part	of	the
therapist	
who	
has	
voyeuristic	
or	
sadistic
tendencies.	This	can	lead	to	narcissistic	wounding
and	
retaliatory	
negative	
reactions.	
Casual
questioning	 on	 the	 topic	 while	 taking	 an	 initial
history	 often	 gives	 a	 clue	 as	 to	 how	 comfortable
the	 patient	 will	 be	 in	 discussing	 the	 matter.	 Of
course,	 there	 are	 certain	 therapy	 situations	 in
which	 it	 is	 extremely	 difficult	 for	 the	 patient	 to
discuss	these	matters.	The	most	obvious	example
is	that	of	an	adolescent	of	one	sex	with	a	therapist
of	the	other,	or	with	a	therapist,	such	as	a	pastoral
counselor,	 who	 is	 seen	 as	 a	 representative	 of
religious	authority.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
802
The	
patient’s	
willingness	
to	
reveal
masturbation	 fantasies	 and	 activities	 is	 a	 good
measure	of	how	deeply	the	patient	is	able	to	trust
the	 therapist,	 providing	 the	 patient	 is	 not	 using
these	 revelations	 in	 the	 interest	 of	 seducing	 or
misleading	the	therapist.	One	of	the	most	difficult
aspects	of	this	subject	is	that	a	number	of	patients
will	 reveal	 masturbatory	 activity	 but	 insist	 they
have	no	fantasies	to	go	with	it,	so	the	information
produced	 is	 not	 very	 useful.	 Here	 the	 question
needs	 to	 be	 about	 what	 is	 blocking	 the	 patient’s
fantasy	 life,	 for	 example,	 the	 incest	 taboo	 or,	 in
some	 cases,	 the	 knowledge	 that	 these	 fantasies
ought	to	be	shared	with	the	therapist.	Sometimes
the	fantasies	involve	the	therapist,	which	makes	it
even	more	difficult	for	the	patient	to	reveal	them.
MEMORY
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
803
One	 of	 the	 basic	 tenets	 of	 psychoanalysis
introduced	 by	 Freud	 (Breuer	 and	 Freud	 1893-
1895)	 was	 the	 importance	 of	 the	 recovery	 of
repressed	 memories.	 The	 issue	 of	 whether	 these
memories	are	of	actual	events,	represent	fantasies
that	 in	 themselves	 are	 compromise	 formations
between	 drives	 and	 defenses,	 or	 are	 screen
memories	 remains	 unresolved	 and	 very	 difficult,
varying	 from	 one	 patient	 to	 another.	 A	 screen
memory	employs	one	memory	to	conceal	a	deeper
and	 more	 important	 memory.	 Again,	 the	 term
“memory”	may	refer	to	actual	events	or	the	child’s
distortions	 or	 even	 fantasies	 of	 such	 events.	 The
standard	goal	of	psychoanalysis	is	to	bring	into	the
conscious	 mind	 both	 the	 repressed	 ideational
content	 and	 the	 repressed	 affect	 that	 these
memories	constitute.
Breuer	and	Freud	believed	that	the	symptoms
of	 the	 hysterical	 patient	 symbolized	 these
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
804
repressed	memories,	which	could	not	be	recalled
because	of	the	intense	affect	associated	with	them.
Hence	 Freud’s	 famous	 statement	 that	 hysterical
patients	 suffer	 from	 “reminiscences.”	 The	 theory
was	that	when	the	unconscious	ideation	and	affect
were	 enabled	 to	 come	 to	 the	 conscious	 mind,
memory	 would	 replace	 the	 symptoms.	 The
discharge	of	the	affect	was	labeled	abreaction	(see
ABREACTION).	 Memory	 and	 its	 recall,	 in	 Freud’s
final	structural	theory,	is	a	function	of	the	ego.
It	is	generally	conceded	that	precise	memories
of	such	traumatic	events	as	the	primal	scene	are
often	
not	
recalled	
even	
in	
a	
successful
psychoanalysis,	 and	 often	 reconstructions	 must
take	place	based	on	indirect	evidence	that	has	the
best	
plausibility.	
This	
shifts	
modern
psychoanalytic	
treatment	
to	
the	
realm	
of
hermeneutics	
and	
exegesis,	
where	
specific
historical	 truth	 is	 often	 difficult	 to	 ascertain	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
805
conflicting	
interpretations	
may	
predominate,
depending	 on	 the	 personalities	 and	 theoretical
orientation	 of	 different	 therapists	 and	 different
patients.	Freud	would	not	have	been	happy	with
this	 shift	 because	 he	 insisted	 repeatedly	 that
psychoanalysis	 was	 a	 natural	 science;	 the	 first
cornerstone	 of	 it	 was	 the	 recovery	 of	 repressed
memories	 that	 were	 thought	 to	 be	 of	 events
etiological	 in	 the	 genesis	 of	 neurotic	 symptoms.
Many	
hysterical	
patients,	
after	
traumatic
memories	 have	 been	 made	 conscious,	 develop	 a
new	set	of	symptoms,	which	is	not	consistent	with
Breuer	 and	 Freud’s	 original,	 more	 optimistic
contentions.	 It	 became	 increasingly	 clear	 even	 in
Freud’s	 lifetime	 that	 the	 factors	 involved	 in
successful	 psychoanalytic	 treatment	 are	 much
more	complex.
The	 dramatic	 revelations	 of	 child	 abuse	 over
the	 last	 decade	 have	 also	 brought	 into	 question
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
806
whether	the	early	memories	were	actual	traumata
or	 fantasies	 based	 on	 the	 patient’s	 wishes.	 The
answer	to	this	probably	varies	from	individual	to
individual.	 Sometimes	 it	 is	 not	 possible	 to
determine	whether	we	are	dealing	with	fantasies
or	literal	events	or	a	combination	of	the	two.	Thus
we	 will	 not	 be	 able	 to	 get	 away	 from	 the
hermeneutic	 aspect	 of	 psychoanalytic	 treatment
(see	HERMENEUTICS).

METAPSYCHIATRY
This	
term	
is	
commonly	
used	
in	
the
professional	 psychiatric	 literature	 to	 represent
issues	 involved	 in	 mysticism,	 transcendental
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
807
meditation,	 and	 various	 esoteric	 phenomena
known	 as	 parapsychology.	 I	 (Chessick	 1991)
defined	it	differently:	the	task	of	metapsychiatry	is
to	ask	certain	questions:	(a)	What	is	the	position
of	
psychotherapy	
in	
Western	
philosophical
tradition?	 (b)	 To	 what	 extent	 can	 psychotherapy
be	 said	 to	 be	 a	 science	 and	 yield	 scientific
knowledge?	 and	 (c)	 To	 what	 extent	 is	 it	 a
philosophy	or	art?
An	outstanding	example	of	metapsychiatry	in
the	sense	that	I	use	it	is	provided	by	Kohut	(1971).
In	
deciding	
whether	
a	
specific	
form	
of
psychotherapy	is	primarily	scientific	or	primarily
inspirational,	
Kohut	
suggests	
asking	
three
important	questions:	(a)	Do	we	have	a	systematic
grasp	 of	 the	 processes	 involved	 in	 therapy?	 (b)
Can	 the	 treatment	 method	 be	 communicated	 to
others,	 learned,	 and	 practiced	 without	 the
presence	of	its	originator?	(c)	Does	the	treatment
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
808
remain	 successful	 after	 the	 death	 of	 its	 creator?
This	 latter	 question	 frequently	 separates	 out
therapies	 that	 primarily	 depend	 on	 the	 charisma
of	their	originators.
One	
of	
the	
most	
important	
areas	
of
metapsychiatry	 to	 have	 generated	 controversy
and	needless	acrimony	is	in	the	conceptualization
and	
understanding	
of	
what	
goes	
on	
in
psychotherapy	 between	 patient	 and	 therapist,
often	 labeled	 therapeutic	 interaction.	 I	 (Chessick
1983)	
have	
attempted	
to	
reduce	
this
metapsychiatric	 controversy	 by	 putting	 various
partial	claims	in	perspective	in	a	“special	theory	of
psychotherapeutic	 interaction.”	 Much	 further
investigation	remains	to	be	done	on	these	topics.

METAPSYCHOLOGY,
MENTAL	APPARATUS
Pruyser	(1978)	argues	that	clinical	theory	and
metapsychology	 in	 Freud’s	 work	 coexist	 and	 are
kept	in	a	fructifying	tension	with	each	other.	They
cannot	 be	 separated.	 He	 argues	 that	 we	 must
tolerate	this	tension	because	the	only	alternative
is	 what	 he	 calls	 “clinicism,”	 which	 is	 positivistic
and	therefore	cannot	really	eliminate	metatheory.
Psychoanalysis	 for	 Pruyser	 is	 an	 “outlook,”	 in	 a
view	exactly	opposite	to	that	of	Gill	(1978)	in	the
same	 volume.	 Gill	 claims	 that	 metapsychology	 is
irrelevant	
to	
psychoanalysis	
because
psychoanalysis	is	the	science	of	human	meanings,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
810
dealing	
with	
goals,	
aims,	
and	
intentions.
Metapsychology,	 he	 says,	 is	 not	 meant	 as	 a
metaphor.	Freud	tried	to	make	it	a	natural	science
of	the	mind	based	on	force,	structure,	energy,	and
mechanisms.	But	Gill	claims	psychoanalysis	is	self-
contained	and	needs	no	such	natural	science	of	the
mind.	 He	 insists	 that	 we	 should	 not	 sharpen	 or
replace	metapsychology	but	simply	dump	it	out	as
an	
excrescence,	
an	
unnecessary
“neuropsychology.”
Metapsychology	represents	the	highest	level	of
abstraction	 in	 the	 continuum	 from	 clinical
observation	 to	 psychoanalytic	 theory	 (Waelder
1962).	 Freud	 described	 it	 as	 having	 a	 dynamic,
economic,	 and	 structural	 viewpoint.	 Dynamics
refer	to	various	conflicting	forces	within	the	mind
associated	with	varying	energies	and	objects.	The
economic	 aspect	 concentrates	 on	 these	 energies
and	 their	 distributions	 in	 the	 mental	 apparatus.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
811
The	structural	theory	organizes	the	mind	into	the
id,	 ego,	 and	 superego.	 Because	 these	 are
experience-distant	 concepts,	 they	 have	 lent
themselves	to	attack.	The	whole	issue	of	whether
metapsychology	 is	 worthwhile	 and	 whether	 any
agreement	can	be	reached	on	what	it	constitutes
remains	unresolved.
Metapsychology,	 for	 Freud,	 is	 a	
causal
explanatory	 system	 substituting	 psychological
explanations	 for	 missing	 organic	 explanations	 of
mental	
processes.	
Freud	
insisted	
that	
his
construction	 of	 a	 mental	 apparatus	 was	 justified
by	 his	 clinical	 observations,	 but	 Basch	 (1973)
makes	it	clear	that	philosophers	have	agreed	that
no	hypothetical	theory	can	be	abstracted	directly
from	 observation.	 For	 Basch,	 Freud’s	 mental
apparatus	is	a	bogus	or	pseudo-entity,	one	whose
potential	 existence	 can	 never	 be	 proven	 or
disproven.	He	argues	that	nothing	can	be	learned
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
812
about	 the	 nature	 of	 thought	 through	 the
psychoanalytic	method.	Freud	(1933)	said,	“First	I
must	admit	that	I	have	tried	to	translate	into	the
language	of	our	normal	thinking	what	must	in	fact
be	 a	 process	 that	 is	 neither	 conscious	 or
preconscious,	 taking	 place	 between	 quotas	 of
energy	in	some	unimaginable	substratum”	(p.	90).
On	the	premise	of	psychophysical	parallelism
(see	 MIND),	 Freud	 attempted	 to	 construct	 a
mental	 apparatus	 of	 a	 psychological	 nature	 only,
totally	 extricating	 himself	 from	 the	 problem	 of
what	 simultaneously	 goes	 on	 in	 the	 brain.
Thought,	 for	 Freud,	 consists	 of	 two	 components.
The	first	of	these	is	judgment,	in	which	the	system
Pcpt.-Cs.	
compares	
an	
emerging	
word
presentation	 linked	 to	 a	 thing	 presentation	 with
successive	
memory	
traces	
to	
determine
correspondence	 to	 reality.	 Second	 is	 trial	 action,
which	for	Freud	represents	an	experimental	way
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
813
of	 acting,	 using	 small	 bits	 of	 energy	 cathexis
without	 involving	 the	 motor	 apparatus;	 we
commonly	 refer	 to	 this	 as	 thinking	 about	 the
subject.	 Basch	 (1975a,b)	 points	 out	
many
difficulties	
in	
this.	
For	
example,	
a	
basic
epistemological	 premise	 maintained	 throughout
Freud’s	
writings	
is	
the	
assumption	
that
perceptions	are	endowed	with	sensory	quality	and
are	
therefore	
primarily	
conscious,	
while
instinctual	drives	are	not	of	a	sensory	nature	and
can	 become	 conscious	 only	 by	 becoming	 united
with	 perceptual	 residues.	 But	 Klein	 (1959)
reviews	
the	
impressive	
body	
of	
evidence
validating	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 brain	 registers	 and
utilizes	 stimuli	 from	 the	 external	 world,	 stimuli
that	 would	 never	 exist	 in	 subjective	 awareness;
this	 contradicts	 Freud’s	 fundamental	 postulate
equating	 perception	 with	 consciousness	 in	 the
system	 Pcpt-Cs.	 Klein	 (1976)	 thus	 calls	 for	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
814
elimination	 of	 many	 aspects	 of	 metapsychology
from	psychoanalysis.
Since	 metapsychological	 concepts	 cannot	 be
said	to	be	directly	inferred	from	clinical	work,	they
are	 subject	 to	 revision	 without	 affecting	 the
clinical	
findings	
and	
clinical	
practice	
of
psychoanalytic	 psychotherapy.	 Metapsychological
constructs	 are	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 explaining
clinical	findings,	and	insofar	as	these	formulations
fail	 to	 achieve	 this	 explanation	 and	 are	 directly
contradictory	 to	 independent	 evidence	 gathered
by	other	valid	methods	of	scientific	investigation,
Basch	 (1973,	 1976a)	 argues	 that	 they	 should	 be
replaced.
The	 major	 early	 presentation	 of	 Freud’s
metapsychology	is	generally	agreed	to	be	found	in
chapter	7	of	The	Interpretation	of	Dreams	(Freud
1900).	 Basch	 (1976b)	 subjects	 this	 chapter	 to	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
815
careful	epistemological	analysis,	pointing	out	that
it	is	replete	with	such	undefined	terms	as	“mental
process”	and	“psychical	acts.”	For	Freud,	even	such
terms	as	“mind”	and	“mental	apparatus”	were	self-
evident.	 In	 his	 psychophysical	 parallelism	 Freud
equates	the	mental	apparatus	with	the	brain;	in	so
doing,	he	presents	a	study	of	thought	formation	in
general	 psychology.	 In	 this	 study	 the	 concept	 of
brain	 as	 a	 physical	 entity	 is	 replaced	 with	 the
concept	of	“mental	apparatus,”	essentially	a	brain
without	 anatomical	 properties,	 carrying	 out
mental	functions.
Freud’s	 idea	 of	 perception	 was	 simplistic,
assuming	 the	 sequence	 “stimulus	 -perception	 -
memory.”	We	now	know	that	perception	does	not
antedate	conception.	On	the	contrary,	conception
creates	 a	 perceptual	 set	 that	 determines	 how
stimuli	 are	 perceived.	 In	 Freud	 the	 Cartesian
dualism	 reasserts	 itself	 in	 the	 implication	 that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
816
thought,	
mind,	
and	
mental	
apparatus	
are
somehow	 something	 different	 and	 beyond	 the
physical.	The	term	“mental	apparatus”	cannot	be
defended	 as	 a	 way	 of	 categorizing	 psychological
phenomena	 in	 the	 manner	 that	 biologists	 make
classifications,	 because	 “mental	 apparatus”	 has
been	 given	 a	 generative	 capacity	 with	 causal
substantive	 explanatory	 value.	 For	 Freud	 the
clinical	 observation	 that	 some	 mentation	 is
conscious,	
some	
preconscious,	
and	
some
unconscious	
became	
expanded	
into	
reified
systems:	 the	 generative	 entities	 Ucs.,	 Pcs.,	 and
Pcpt.-Cs.	of	the	topographical	theory.
Those	like	Holt	(1981)	or	Gill	(1978)	who	wish
to	 throw	 out	 metapsychology	 entirely	 are	 the
philosophical	opponents	of	Ricoeur	(1970,	1977).
But	
Meissner	
(1971)	
points	
out:	
“The
methodology	 that	 Freud	 employed	 was	 an	 open-
ended	 and	 dynamic	 process,	 constantly	 involved
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
817
in	a	return	to	dialectical	interpretation	of	the	data
of	experience	and	observation.	His	concepts	were
tentative,	changing	and	evolving,	always	subject	to
the	mutative	and	clarifying	influence	of	new	data
based	 upon	 clinical	 observation	 and	 experience”
(p.	285).
It	 seems	 to	 me	 that	 this	 description	 is
unassailable.	
Meissner	
(1971)	
says	
Freud
developed	a	method	that	embraced	both	objective
and	 subjective	 data,	 making	 psychoanalysis	 a
“scientific	hybrid—a	scientific	approach	to	human
subjectivity”	 (p.	 305).	 Meissner	 concludes	 that
Freud	viewed	psychoanalysis	as	standing	closer	to
the	ideographic	pole	rather	than	to	the	nomothetic
pole	in	the	continuum	of	sciences,	for	it	is	based	on
the	uniqueness	and	individuality	of	meaning	of	the
individual’s	life	history	and	experiences.
The	vicissitudes	of	the	transference	are	central
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
818
to	
the	
understanding	
and	
practice	
of
psychoanalytic	technique	according	to	Gill	(1982).
The	
recurrences	
of	
these	
transference
configurations,	 as	 Modell	 (1978)	 points	 out,
constitute	 observable	 clinical	 data	 of	 a	 natural
science—these	 are	 the	 “facts”	 of	 psychoanalysis,
and	 they	 permit	 intersubjective	 validation.	 But
Modell	disagrees	with	Gill	(and	Klein),	in	that	he
objects	 to	 a	 fundamental	 disjunction	 between
clinical	theory	and	metapsychology.	For	example,
the	 concept	 of	 superego	 is	 “eminently	 clinical,”
says	 Modell,	 and	 it	 should	 also	 be	 noted	 that
claims	 of	 such	 a	 disjunction	 are	 contradicted	 by
Meissner’s	 description	 of	 Freud’s	 view	 and
method	as	described	above.
Steele	(1979)	and	Holt	(1981)	present	directly
conflicting	 opinions	 on	 the	 subject.	 For	 Steele,
psychoanalysis	 is	 “unquestionably	 a	 form	 of
hermeneutics”	 (p.	 409).	 He	 emphasizes	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
819
congruity	 of	 Freud’s	 ideas	 with	 those	 of	 modern
hermeneutics	 on	 self-reflection,	 meaning,	 and
validity.	 For	 Holt	 (1981),	 psychoanalysis	 is	 in
principle	 exactly	 like	 all	 other	 sciences,	 but
Grünbaum	
(1983,	
1984)	
would	
vigorously
disagree.	
Metapsychology,	
for	
Holt,	
is	
an
inconsistent	mess	and	is	dying;	what	is	needed	is	a
scientific	and	testable	clinical	theory,	which	is	just
as	 possible	 for	 psychoanalysis	 as	 for	 any	 other
natural	 science.	 This	 view	 is	 also	 strongly
supported	 by	 Edelson	 (1984),	 who	 attempts	 to
outline	 the	 requirements	 of	 such	 a	 theory.	 The
problem	remains	unresolved.

MID-LIFE	CRISIS
(JUNG)
Popular	 psychology	 blames	 a	 whole	 host	 of
difficulties	that	occur	in	middle	age	on	the	“mid-
life	crisis,”	which	is	a	term	that	explains	nothing
and	 describes	 very	 little.	 It	 is	 useful	 to	 remind
psychotherapists	 that	 professional	 concentration
on	the	middle	period	of	life	began	with	the	work	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
823
Carl	 Jung	 (1875-1961).	 Jung	 believed	 that	 the
unconscious	
contains	
creative	
as	
well	
as
“monstrous”	 impulses	 and	 expresses	 itself	 by
means	of	symbols.	Most	of	his	theorizing	is	simply
mysticism,	which	appeals	to	those	with	a	certain
temperament.	But	Jung	(1933)	did	make	a	sharp
distinction	 between	 what	 he	 called	 the	 youth
period,	 where	 all	 of	 Freud’s	 theories	 hold	 and
which	 is	 marked	 by	 rebellion	 and	 the	 wish	 to
remain	a	child,	and	the	afternoon	of	life,	in	which
there	 is	 nothing	 left,	 and	 as	 the	 wine	 of	 youth
becomes	turbid,	there	is	an	increasing	incidence	of
depression.
Jung	disagrees	with	what	he	calls	Freud’s	idea
that	humans	should	be	interpreted	exclusively	in
the	 light	 of	 their	 defects,	 and	 he	 labels	 Freud’s
work	 the	 psychology	 of	 the	 sick	 mind.	 He
attributes	 a	 positive	 value	 to	 all	 religions	 as
symbolic	 expressions	 of	 the	 unconscious	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
824
carriers	 of	 moral	 teachings	 and	 he	 rejects
sexuality	as	a	basic	driving	force.	Jung	argues	that
we	 must	 rediscover	 the	 life	 of	 the	 spirit	 and
underlines	 the	 profound	 uncertainty	 of	 modern
humans	 who	 cannot	 decide	 to	 accept	 the	 inner
reality	 of	 the	 psyche,	 which	 leads	 to	 profound
tensions.	 For	 Jung,	 a	 psychoneurosis	 is	 the
suffering	 of	 a	 human	 being	 who	 has	 not
discovered	what	life	means,	and	in	middle	age	it	is
necessary	to	find	a	religious	outlook	that	helps	the
person	 hold	 his	 or	 her	 own	 against	 unconscious
forces.
As	vague	and	mystical	as	this	is,	Jung	must	be
credited	 with	 noting	 that	 human	 being	 is	 being-
toward-death.	 The	 considerations	 of	 the	 middle-
aged	and	aging	individual,	although	they	are	much
contaminated	
by	
unresolved	
problems	
of
childhood,	must	be	referred	increasingly	to	issues
involving	 death	 and	 failing	 to	 live	 up	 to	 one’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
825
hopes,	plans,	and	ideals.	Much	later	Kohut	(1971,
1977)	 reemphasized	 these	 issues,	 which	 are
predominantly	 narcissistic	 problems	 and	 explain
the	 incidence	 of	 narcissistic	 pathology	 in	 middle
age.	The	term	“midlife	crisis”	should	be	eliminated
because	 it	 is	 not	 a	 necessary	 concomitant	 of
middle	 age	 and	 has	 been	 used	 to	 “explain”	 a
variety	of	phenomena	that	are	not	related	to	each
other	or	to	the	aging	process.

MIND,
MIND-BODY	PROBLEM
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
826
There	 is	 a	 vast	 literature	 on	 this	 topic	 and	 a
variety	
of	
professional	
positions,	
neatly
summarized	 by	 Churchland	 (1984).	 The	 most
common	 view	 of	 the	 mind	 in	 solutions	 to	 the
mind-body	 problem	 is	 generally	 known	 as
dualism,	or	psychophysical	parallelism.	Substance
dualism	 is	 the	 famous	 philosophy	 of	 Descartes,
stating	 that	 each	 mind	 is	 a	 distinct	 nonphysical
thing,	a	nonphysical	substance	independent	of	any
physical	 body	 to	 which	 it	 may	 be	 temporarily
attached.	 Popular	 dualism	 viewed	 the	 mind	 as	 a
sort	of	ghost	in	a	machine,	where	the	machine	is
the	 human	 body	 and	 the	 mind	 is	 some	 sort	 of
spiritual	 or	 psychic	 substance	 unlike	 physical
matter	 and	 inside	 the	 brain	 in	 intimate	 contact
with	
it.	
Property	
dualism,	
for	
example,
epiphenomenalism,	 sees	 the	 mind	 as	 containing
special	 properties	 that	 emerge	 when	 the	 brain
passes	a	certain	level	of	complexity,	which	do	not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
827
in	 turn	 affect	 the	 brain.	 Interactionist	 property
dualism	differs	in	that	interactionists	in	this	school
assert	 that	 mental	 properties	 do	 indeed	 have
causal	 effects	 on	 the	 brain	 and	 behavior.
Churchland	 (1984)	 reminds	 us,	 “Any	 property
dualist	makes	the	further	claim	that	mental	states
and	 properties	 are	 irreducible,	 in	 the	 sense	 that
they	 are	 not	 just	 organizational	 features	 of
physical	 matter	 …	 they	 are	 said	 to	 be	 novel
properties	 beyond	 prediction	 or	 explanation	 by
physical	 science	 …	 this	 last	 condition—the
irreducibility	
of	
mental	
properties—is	
an
important	 one,	 since	 this	 is	 what	 makes	 the
position	a	dualist	position”	(p.	12).
In	 contrast	 to	 these	 dualist	 positions	 is
philosophical	 behaviorism,	 which	 denies	 any
ghostly	 inner	 states	 and	 claims	 there	 are	 just
potential	 patterns	 of	 behavior,	 or	 reductive
materialism,	 more	 commonly	 known	 as	 identity
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
828
theory,	 claiming	 that	 mental	 states	 are	 physical
states	 of	 the	 brain.	 In	 this	 view	 each	 mental
process	 is	 one	 and	 the	 same	 thing	 as	 a	 physical
state	 or	 process	 in	 the	 brain	 or	 central	 nervous
system.	
In	
a	
modification,	
the	
view	
of
functionalism,	 each	 mental	 state	 is	 thought	 of	 as
definable	only	with	respect	to	other	mental	states
so	 that	 relational	 properties	 of	 the	 mind	 are	 the
crucial	 ones.	 The	 difference	 from	 behaviorism	 is
that	functionalism	claims	mental	states	cannot	be
defined	solely	in	terms	of	environmental	input	and
behavioral	
output	
but	
always	
require	
an
ineliminable	reference	to	a	variety	of	other	mental
states.	Functionalists	say	a	reductive	definition	of
mind	solely	in	terms	of	publicly	observable	inputs
and	 outputs	 that	 the	 behaviorists	 use	 is	 not
possible.
In	the	view	of	“eliminative	materialism,”	there
never	 will	 be	 a	 match-up	 between	 the	 common
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
829
sense	 concepts	 of	 popular	 psychology	 and	 the
concepts	of	theoretical	neuroscience	“because	our
commonsense	psychological	framework	is	a	false
and	radically	misleading	conception	of	the	causes
of	 human	 behavior	 and	 the	 nature	 of	 cognitive
activity”	 (Churchland	 1984,	 p.	 43).	 Furthermore,
popular	psychology	is	a	misrepresentation	of	our
internal	 states	 and	 activities.	 This	 old	 popular
framework	 will	 be	 dropped	 out	 as	 neuroscience
improves,	argue	the	eliminative	materialists.
The	 issue	 of	 whether	 artificial	 intelligence	 is
equivalent	 to	 the	 mind	 also	 remains	 extremely
controversial.	 Searle	 (1984)	 argues	 that	 mental
phenomena,	 which	 are	 conscious,	 intentional,
subjective,	and	seem	to	have	mental	causation,	are
caused	 by	 brain	 processes	 but	 have	 their	 own
existence	 and	 can	 influence	 the	 brain.	 He
combines	naive	mentalism	with	naive	physicalism
and	 argues	 that	 the	 mind	 is	 not	 just	 a	 computer
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
830
program.	For	Searle,	the	natural	sciences	are	not
the	same	as	the	social	sciences	because	social	and
psychological	phenomena	are	mental.	Thinking,	he
says,	 is	 not	 just	 simple	 manipulation,	 and
understanding	is	not	like	a	computer	program.
The	 answer	 to	 this	 argument	 will	 probably
come	 from	 whether	 or	 not	 experts	 in	 artificial
intelligence	 can	 develop	 computers	 that	 are
indistinguishable	 from	 minds!	 Recently	 the	 first
Turing	test,	an	experiment	proposed	42	years	ago
by	 the	 British	 mathematician	 Alan	 Turing,	 took
place	in	Boston	(Markoff	1992).	Turing	proposed
that	the	question	of	whether	a	machine	could	ever
be	built	equivalent	to	the	human	mind	would	be
answered	 if	 persons	 communicating	 with	 the
machine	could	not	tell	whether	it	was	a	computer
or	 a	 human	 being.	 The	 results	 were	 mixed,
although	for	the	most	part	the	judges	were	able	to
distinguish	computers	from	humans.	But	the	trend
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
831
seems	to	be	that	ultimately	computers	will	not	be
distinguishable	 from	 humans	 in	 the	 Turing	 test.
This	 will	 enormously	 complicate	 the	 issue	 of
deciding	 what	 constitutes	 the	 human	 mind	 and
make	dualists	quite	hard	pressed	to	maintain	their
theories.	However,	many	experts	on	both	sides	of
the	 debate	 reject	 the	 Turing	 test	 as	 providing	 a
valid	answer	to	the	question	of	the	equivalence	of
minds	and	computers.
A	 similar	 and	 overlapping	 debate	 exists	 over
the	 mysterious	 nature	 of	 consciousness	 (see
CONSCIOUS),	 where	 Freud	 himself	 stumbled	 and
was	 forced	 to	 abandon	 his	 1895	 neurological
“Project	for	a	Scientific	Psychology”	(Freud	1950),
and	 which	 often	 constitutes	 the	 central	 issue	 in
arguments	
about	
the	
nature	
of	
mind.
Reductionists,	such	as	Jaynes	(1976)	and	Dennett
(1991),	 see	 consciousness	 as	 evolving	 in	 biology
or	history	and	constituting	merely	physical	events
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
832
in	the	brain,	whereas	Searle	(1992)	and	Penrose
(1990)	 take	 an	 opposing	 point	 of	 view	 as	 does
also,	rather	surprisingly,	the	famous	neurosurgeon
Penfield	 (1975).	 I	 believe	 the	 extraordinary
breakthrough	 in	 computer	 technology	 that	 is
taking	place	at	the	turn	of	the	twenty-first	century
will	 enable	 us	 to	 discuss	 and	 explore	 these
problems	 at	 a	 much	 higher	 level	 of	 scientific
sophistication.	 For	 a	 brief	 introduction	 to	 this
increasingly	technical	and	difficult	subject	see	the
debate	 over	 artificial	 intelligence	 in	 Scientific
American	 262:25-37,	 1990,	 between	 Searle	 and
the	Churchlands.

MIRROR	STAGE
Lacan	(1968)	defined	personality	as	a	psychic
synthesis	that	adapts	the	human	to	the	milieu	of
society.	It	is	formed	first	by	the	image	in	a	mirror
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
834
stage,	 an	 imaginary	 hallucinatory	 phase	 of
development,	 and	 then	 by	 the	 milieu,	 which	 he
calls	 “the	 name-of-the-father,”	 or	 the	 symbolic
order	of	society	(see	LACAN).
The	mirror	stage,	which	occurs	from	about	age
6	 to	 18	 months,	 is	 one	 in	 which	 the	 infant
jubilantly	identifies	with	its	reflection,	a	reflection
that	 promises	 unity,	 mastery,	 and	 stature.	 This
image	 is	 a	 rigid	 idealized	 totality.	 For	 Lacan,	 it
begins	 the	 opposition	 of	 the	 ego	 versus	 the	 true
self.	Lacan	(1978)	calls	this	a	Spaltung,	a	splitting
of	 the	 subject,	 which	 is	 required	 before	 the
entrance	into	the	cultural	milieu,	so	that	when	one
enters	the	milieu	there	is	something	to	label	as	“I”
in	 discourse.	 There	 is	 no	 empirical	 evidence	 for
such	a	stage,	but	Lacan	(1977)	at	times	seems	to

MIRROR	TRANSFERENCE
In	 Kohut’s	 (1977)	 self	 psychology	 (see	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY),	
as	
a	
consequence	
of
developmental	 arrest	 and	 the	 failure	 to	 properly
integrate	
archaic	
structures,	
characteristic
“selfobject	 transferences”	 take	 place.	 These
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
836
transferences	are	the	result	of	the	amalgamation
of	the	unconscious	archaic	narcissistic	structures
(grandiose	self	and	idealized	parent	imago)	with	a
psychic	 representation	 of	 the	 analyst,	 under	 the
pressure	 of	 the	 need	 to	 relieve	 the	 unfulfilled
narcissistic	 needs	 of	 childhood.	 They	 are	 not
motivated	 by	 the	 need	 to	 discharge	 instinctual
tensions,	nor	are	they	produced	by	cathecting	the
analyst	with	object	libido.	One	may	wish	to	think
of	them	as	transferencelike	phenomena,	since	they
do	not	fit	Freud’s	metapsychology	of	transference.
Among	these	selfobject	transferences	are	three
forms	 of	 mirror	 transferences,	 the	 result	 of	 the
therapeutic	 mobilization	 of	 the	 repressed	 and
unintegrated	archaic	grandiose	self.	The	purpose
of	 these	 transferences	 is	 to	 share	 with	 the
therapist	 the	 patient’s	 exhibitionistic	 grandiosity,
either	 by	 participating	 with	 the	 therapist	 in	 the
imagined	greatness	of	the	patient	or	by	having	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
837
therapist	reflect	and	confirm	the	greatness	of	the
patient.	 In	 the	 archaic	 merger	 type	 of	 mirror
transference,	the	patient	experiences	the	therapist
as	 part	 of	 the	 patient,	 expects	 the	 therapist	 to
know	what	is	on	the	patient’s	mind,	and	demands
total	control	of	the	type	one	demands	from	one’s
own	arm	or	leg.
In	 the	 alter-ego	 or	 twinship	 type	 of	 mirror
transference,	the	patient	insists	that	the	therapist
is	like	or	similar	to	the	patient	psychologically	or
that	the	therapist	and	the	patient	look	alike.	Kohut
(1984)	 later	 separated	 this	 as	 a	 third	 form	 of
selfobject	transference.
In	 the	 third	 type	 of	 mirror	 transference,	 or
mirror	transference	proper,	the	patient	recognizes
that	the	therapist	looks	and	is	different,	but	insists
on	 assigning	 to	 the	 therapist	 the	 sole	 task	 of
praising,	 echoing,	 and	 mirroring	 the	 patient’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
838
performance	and	greatness.	Kohut	relates	this	to
the	gleam	in	the	mother’s	eye	as	she	watches	her
baby.	 It	 becomes	 very	 difficult	 at	 times	 to	 tell
which	type	of	selfobject	transference	has	formed,
especially	 in	 the	 less	 primitive	 transferences,
where	 it	 is	 hard	 to	 distinguish	 between	 the
grandiose	demand	for	mirroring	and	the	demand
for	approval	from	the	idealized	parent.
Disturbance	of	mirror	transferences	leads	to	a
sense	 of	 crumbling	 self,	 hypochondria,	 and
hypercathexis	of	isolated	parts	of	either	the	body,
various	mental	functions,	or	activities.	Compulsive
sexuality,	 characterized	 by	 exhibitionism	 and
other	 sexual	 varieties	 and	 perversions,	 often
appears	to	combat	the	sense	of	deadness	and	an
empty	self;	its	purpose	is	to	magically	restitute	the
sense	of	self	and	of	being	psychologically	alive.
Typical	
countertransference	
reactions	
to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
839
mirror	transferences	(Kohut	1971)	are	boredom,
lack	of	involvement	with	the	patient,	inattention,
annoyance,	sarcasm,	and	a	tendency	to	lecture	the
patient	
out	
of	
the	
therapist’s
counterexhibitionism,	 or	 to	 obtain	 control	 by
exhortation	and	persuasion.

MULTIPLE	FUNCTION
For	 Waelder	 (1936),	 humans	 are	 driven
impulsively	by	the	id	and	purposefully	by	the	ego.
Every	 one	 of	 a	 person’s	 actions	 is	 an	 attempt	 by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
840
the	 ego	 to	 solve	 a	 problem;	 even	 an	 apparently
impulsive	 act	 is	 such	 an	 attempt.	 The	 ego	 must
deal	 with	 (a)	 the	 claims	 of	 instinct,	 (b)	 the
compulsion	to	repeat,	(c)	the	superego	commands
and	 prohibitions,	 and	 (d)	 the	 outer	 world.	 It	 not
only	has	to	mediate	among	each	of	these,	but	it	has
its	 own	 disposition	 to	 dominate	 and	 overcome
them	and	to	join	them	to	its	organization	by	active
assimilation.	 So	 each	 of	 the	 four	 poses	 two
problems	for	the	ego.	Thus	Waelder	arrives	at	his
principle	of	multiple	function:	any	solution	of	one
of	 the	 eight	 problems	 represents	 simultaneously
an	 attempted	 solution	 of	 all	 the	 others.	 Each
psychic	act,	to	some	degree,	attempts	to	solve	all
the	 problems,	 although	 it	 always	 represents	 a
compromise.	 Because	 of	 this,	 says	 Waelder,	 all
people	are	perpetually	dissatisfied.
Overdetermination	 means	 that	 several	 trends
are	expressed	by,	and	there	is	a	multiple	meaning
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
841
to,	 every	 action,	 symptom,	 and	 psychological
expression	(see	OVERDETERMINATION).	Multiple
function	 implies	 that	 a	 definitive	 number	 of
solutions	are	always	expressed.	Even	in	character
formation,	says	Waelder,	the	solution	must	gratify
the	instinct	as	well	as	defend	against	it.	A	neurosis
attempts	 solutions	 of	 all	 the	 problems.	 Every
solution	must	be	for	the	claims	of	the	outer	world,
for	 instinctual	 pressure,	 for	 superego	 demands,
and	for	the	pressure	of	the	compulsion	to	repeat,
as	well	as	for	the	attempt	to	master	and	assimilate
all	of	these.	Symptom	formation	and	the	neuroses
are	 seen	 as	 having	 multiple	 meanings,	 multiple
functions,	and	an	overdetermination	of	meanings.
This	 enormously	 complicates	 the	 interpretive
process	 and	 also	 allows	 us	 to	 understand	 why
there	is	such	resistance	to	alteration	of	the	ego,	a
resistance	even	Freud	(1937)	recognized	when	he
pointed	 out	 that	 the	 ego	 treats	 recovery	 as	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
842
danger.	If	so	many	things	are	being	solved	by	any
given	 symptom,	 a	 great	 deal	 is	 lost	 when	 the
compromise	 formation	 is	 given	 up,	 and	 a	 whole
Pandora’s	box	of	unresolved	intrapsychic	tensions
is	reopened.

MUTATIVE	INTERPRETATION
A	major	step	in	understanding	the	factors	that
lead	 to	 change	 in	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 was
taken	 by	 Strachey	 (1934).	 His	 work	 is	 based	 on
Kleinian	 theory	 and	 represents	 a	 direction
followed	 by	 Kleinians	 and	 neo-Kleinians	 in	 their
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
843
characterization	
of	
factors	
that	
produce
therapeutic	 change.	 Strachey	 begins	 by	 pointing
out	that	1912	to	1917	was	the	era	of	“resistance
analysis,”	 represented	 by	 Freud’s	 papers	 on
technique	 and	 chapters	 27	 and	 28	 of	 the
Introductory	 Lectures	 on	 Psychoanalysis	 (Freud
1915-1917).	 Resistance	 analysis	 is	 derived	 from
the	early	concepts	described	in	Studies	on	Hysteria
(Breuer	 and	 Freud	 1893-1895),	 which	 assume
that	if	one	makes	the	unconscious	conscious	by	an
interpretation,	 the	 symptoms	 will	 disappear.
When	 the	 symptoms	 did	 not	 disappear,	 this	 was
explained	as	due	to	resistance,	or	due	to	the	fact
that	the	insight	was	only	intellectual.	The	problem
became	one	of	how	to	get	rid	of	the	resistance.	The
idea	at	the	time	was	that	this	would	be	a	function
of	 the	 will	 to	 recovery	 in	 the	 patient,	 of	 arguing
with	the	patient	about	the	importance	of	removing
the	resistance,	and	above	all,	of	the	transference,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
844
which	allowed	the	analyst	to	influence	the	patient.
Strachey	claimed	that	the	part	of	the	ego	Freud
wished	 to	 modify	 was	 the	 superego,	 the	 analyst
taking	the	place	of	the	superego	(see	SUPEREGO).
In	 the	 Kleinian	 view,	 the	 neurotic	 superego	 is
sadistic	 and	 savage	 due	 to	 cycles	 of	 introjection
and	 projection.	 The	 introjected	 image	 of	 the
analyst	is	kept	separate	from	the	savage	superego
and	functions	as	an	auxiliary	superego.	The	danger
of	this	is	that	the	arrangement	can	break	down	at
any	time,	in	which	case	there	is	a	projection	of	the
sadistic	 superego	 on	 the	 analyst	 that	 leads	 to	 a
sudden	 negative	 transference,	 a	 common	 clinical
phenomenon.
A	 mutative	 interpretation,	 said	 Strachey
(1934),	 calls	 attention	 at	 this	 highly	 affectually
charged	point	to	the	difference	between	the	reality
of	 the	 analyst	 and	 what	 the	 patient	 is	 projecting
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
845
onto	 the	 analyst.	 It	 breaks	 the	 vicious	 cycle,	 as
what	is	now	introjected	will	be	more	realistically
benign	 and	 less	 hostile.	 Repeatedly,	 the	 harsh
superego	and	the	projection	of	it	onto	the	analyst
leads	 to	 a	 cycle	 of	 rage,	 projection,	 defense,	 and
more	 rage.	 This	 is	 broken	 up	 by	 mutative
interpretations	 involving	 these	 aspects	 of	 the
transference.	 By	 the	 analyst’s	 interpretation	 of
primitive	id	impulses,	the	patient	comes	to	realize
that	these	are	at	an	archaic	fantasy	object,	not	at
all	 the	 “real”	 analyst.	 So	 small	 doses	 of	 reality
modify	 the	 patient’s	 superego	 through	 the
internalization	of	the	analyst,	better	perceived	as	a
benign	object,	into	the	superego.
Strachey	 described	 two	 requirements	 for	 a
mutative	interpretation.	First	the	patient	must	be
able	 to	 realize	 that	 a	 quantity	 of	 id	 energy	 has
been	 directed	 to	 the	 analyst;	 second,	 the	 patient
must	 be	 able	 to	 distinguish	 between	 the	 real
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
846
analyst	 and	 a	 fantasy	 object.	 Of	 course,	 this
assumes	 that	 the	 analyst	 avoids	 behavior	 that
confirms	
the	
projection.	
Reassuring	
and
encouraging	the	patient	to	see	the	analyst	as	good
—affect-laden	active	approaches,	such	as	those	of
Ferenczi—are	of	no	help	because,	according	to	the
Kleinians,	the	good	object	is	then	just	introjected
to	 defend	 against	 the	 bad	 object,	 and	 so	 the
negative	 impulses	 will	 never	 appear,	 never	 be
projected,	and	cannot	be	analyzed.
An	 important	 factor	 producing	 change	 in
psychoanalytic	 therapy,	 said	 Strachey,	 is	 that
every	 mutative	 interpretation	 must	 be	 at	 the
emotional	 point	 of	 urgency	 and	 made	 deeply	 in
spite	of	anxiety.	According	to	the	Kleinians,	this	is
the	 safest	 way	 to	 eliminate	 the	 anxiety.	 The
interpretation	 must	 be	 specified,	 detailed,	 and
concrete.	Reassurance,	inexactness,	and	vagueness
all	blunt	the	mutative	effect.	Abreaction	does	not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
847
bring	about	alterations	in	the	ego	or	superego	(see
ABREACTION).	 Extratransference	 interpretations
are	not	to	the	point	of	urgency	and	the	object	is
not	 present,	 so	 the	 patient	 cannot	 compare	 the
real	 and	 fantasy	 object.	 For	 Strachey,	 therefore,
extratransference	 interpretations,	 at	 worst,	 can
represent	 wild	 analysis;	 at	 best,	 they	 are	 less
effective	but	less	risky	and	so	can	be	essential,	but
they	are	not	mutative.
The	crucial	factor	in	the	therapeutic	action	of
psychoanalysis,	 according	 to	 Strachey,	 is	 the
modification	 of	 the	 superego	 by	 innumerable
small	steps	through	mutative	interpretations.	This
approach,	 which	 rests	 on	 Kleinian	 theory	 and
conceives	 of	 the	 analyst	 being	 internalized	 as	 a
temporary	new	object,	is	still	based	on	the	notion
that	cognitive	insight	leads	to	an	alteration	of	the
ego.	It	implies	an	affect-laden	interaction	between
the	 patient	 and	 the	 therapist,	 in	 which	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
848
therapist	is	the	arbiter	of	reality	and	is	responsible
for	 pointing	 out	 “distortions	 of	 reality”	 to	 the
patient.

MYSTIFICATION
(LAING)
One	
of	
the	
most	
important	
clinical
contributions	of	R.	D.	Laing	(1969)	is	the	concept
of	mystification,	also	discussed	at	length	in	a	little-
known	 article	 by	 Laing	 (1965)	 that	 should	 be	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
849
classic	for	study	by	all	mental	health	professionals.
The	concept	of	mystification	actually	comes	from
Marx,	
for	
whom	
it	
means	
“plausible”
misrepresentation	 of	 what	 is	 going	 on	 in	 the
service	of	the	interests	of	one	socioeconomic	class
over	another.	In	The	Politics	of	Experience	 (Laing
1967),	 mystification	 is	 illustrated	 by	 exploitation
of	 third	 world	 countries	 being	 presented	 by	 the
imperialists	
as	
benevolent,	
in	
which	
the
Europeans	 view	 themselves	 as	 God’s	 gift	 to	 the
world.	 So	 when	 exploitation	 is	 made	 to	 seem
benevolent,	it	appears	to	be	bad	or	mad	to	think	of
rebellion.	 More	 generally,	 driving	 a	 person	 crazy
means	making	it	impossible	for	the	person	to	tell
who	 he	 or	 she	 is,	 who	 the	 other	 is,	 and	 what
situation	they	are	in.	A	common	example	would	be
a	parent	with	a	child	or	a	therapist	with	a	patient,
who	 is	 in	 a	 situation	 where	 it	 is	 forbidden	 to
gratify	 aroused	 sexual	 desire,	 yet	 subtly	 sexually
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
850
stimulates	the	child	or	patient.
What	keeps	the	child	or	patient	in	the	mess	is
the	 shared	 ideology	 or	 fantasy	 system	 of	 the
family,	 or	 of	 the	 therapist-patient	 dyad,	 which
makes	 it	 impossible	 for	 him	 or	 her	 to	 see	 the
problem	 clearly.	 As	 Laing	 (1969)	 says,	 the	 more
untenable	a	position	is,	the	more	difficult	it	is	to
get	out	of	it.	An	untenable	position	is	a	situation	in
which	 feelings	 are	 denuded	 of	 validity,	 acts	 are
stripped	 of	 motives,	 and	 the	 situation	 itself	 is
robbed	 of	 meaning.	 Emergence	 from	 a	 shared
fantasy	 system	 is	 felt	 as	 bad,	 evil,	 and	 selfish.
Mental	illness	is	seen	as	the	way	out	that	the	free
organism	in	its	total	unity	invents	in	order	to	be
able	 to	 live	 through	 this	 intolerable	 situation.
Laing	points	out	that	every	preschizophrenic	was
in	a	highly	mystified	state	before	a	breakdown.
Laing	 carries	 this	 further,	 because	 in	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
851
politics	of	the	family	or	society	to	mystify	means	to
befuddle,	cloud	over,	or	confuse	what	is	going	on
by	substituting	false	for	true	constructions	of	what
is	 being	 experienced,	 done,	 or	 occurring,	 and	 by
the	 substitution	 of	 false	 issues	 for	 actual	 issues.
The	 purpose	 of	 mystification	 is	 to	 maintain
stereotyped	roles,	such	as	political	ideology,	family
roles,	 and	 “pseudomutuality”	 in	 the	 family.	 The
state	of	mystification	is	one	of	being	muddled	and
confused;	 however,	 a	 mystified	 person	 may	 not
consciously	feel	confused	but	rather	falsely	calm,
or,	 alternatively,	 conflicted	 over	 false	 issues.	 The
therapist	 must	 decide	 what	 is	 the	 central	 issue,
even	if	this	is	disjunctive	with	the	perceptions	of
family	members.

N
NARCISSISM
Freud’s	 “On	 Narcissism:	 An	 Introduction”
(1914)	is	one	of	the	most	famous	and	important	of
his	writings.	It	had	a	revolutionary	impact	on	his
followers	not	only	because	it	revised	old	ideas	and
introduced	 some	 new	 concepts,	 but	 because	 it
introduced	 some	 serious	 new	 confusions	 and
difficulties.	 Freud’s	 main	 polemical	 point	 in	 this
paper	was	his	attempt	to	restrict	the	meaning	of
the	 term	 “libido”	 to	 sexual	 energy;	 Adler	 had
attempted	 to	 regard	 it	 as	 a	 force	 or	 striving	 for
power,	 and	 Jung	 had	 widened	 it	 to	 mean	 the
energy	 behind	 all	 life	 processes	 (see	 LIBIDO).	 In
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
854
order	 to	 stick	 to	 his	 original	 conception	 of	 the
libido,	 Freud	 had	 to	 make	 important	 theoretical
revisions,	 the	 most	 fundamental	 of	 which	 was	 a
change	in	his	theory	of	instincts	(see	INSTINCT).
Freud’s	 famous	 U-tube	 analogy	 of	 the	 flow	 of
libido	 is	 presented,	 beginning	 with	 the	 premise
that	in	development	all	libido	is	first	collected	in
the	 ego.	 We	 define	 its	 outward	 flow	 as	 the
situation	 of	 object	 love—love	 for	 other	 objects
than	the	self.	However,	it	can	flow	back	again	or	be
withdrawn	 into	 the	 ego	 (not	 differentiated	 from
self	 here)	 under	 various	 situations,	 such	 as
disease,	 an	 accident,	 or	 old	 age,	 where	 this
tendency	 for	 self-preoccupation	 and	 self-love	 is
especially	obvious.	When	the	libido	is	attached	to
the	ego,	the	situation	is	defined	as	narcissism	and
narcissistic	 personality	 features	 predominate.	 In
the	 early	 phase	 of	 life	 this	 situation	 is	 normal,
according	 to	 Freud;	 he	 labeled	 it	 primary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
855
narcissism.	 Secondary	 narcissism	 occurs	 in	 later
stages	of	life,	when	the	libido	is	withdrawn	again
to	the	ego.
What	 Jones	 (1955)	 calls	 the	 disagreeable
aspect	 of	 this	 theory	 is	 the	 fact	 that	 Freud	 was
hard	
put	
to	
demonstrate	
nonnarcissistic
components	of	the	ego.	To	say	there	is	reason	to
suppose	the	ego	is	strongly	invested	with	libido	is
not	the	same	as	saying	it	is	composed	of	nothing
else,	Jones	contends,	but	that	“something	else”	is
difficult	 to	 pin	 down	 and	 opens	 the	 theory	 to
criticism	 of	 being	 a	 monistic	 libidinal	 conception
of	the	mind.	This	theoretical	aspect	of	narcissism
is	 still	 not	 adequately	 resolved;	 considerable
controversy	 rages	 about	 the	 entire	 subject	 (see
Sandler	 et	 al.	 1991).	 Clearly,	 at	 this	 point	 Freud
conceived	 of	 two	 kinds	 of	 ego	 energies,	 the
libidinal	and	the	nonlibidinal.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
856
Freud	(1914)	begins	by	stating	that	narcissism
is	not	a	perversion	(see	PERVERSION),	but	rather
“the	 libidinal	 complement	 to	 the	 egoism	 of	 the
instinct	 of	 self-preservation,	 a	 measure	 of	 which
may	 justifiably	 be	 attributed	 to	 every	 living
creature”	 (pp.	 73-74).	 The	 U-tube	 theory	 is	 then
introduced.	 Another	 analogy	 offered	 by	 Freud	 is
that	 of	 the	 body	 of	 an	 amoeba	 related	 to	 the
pseudopodia	that	it	puts	out	and	withdraws.	Just
as	 one	 observes	 the	 pseudopodia	 under	 the
microscope,	so	libido	can	either	flow	out	to	objects
or	flow	back	to	the	ego.	This	phenomenon	of	ego-
libido	spoils	the	neat	dualistic	early	instinct	theory
that	divides	all	drives	into	sexual	or	egoistic	(self-
preservative).
Freud	immediately	emphasizes	the	importance
of	 the	 concept	 of	 narcissism	 in	 understanding
schizophrenic	
phenomena;	
the	
megalomanic
aspect	of	schizophrenic	patients	is	explained	as	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
857
consequence	of	secondary	narcissism.	Most	of	the
libido	is	directed	to	the	self,	especially	as	seen	in
paranoid	grandiosity.	The	converse	phenomenon,
where	 the	 most	 libido	 possible	 is	 directed	 to	 an
object,	is	defined	as	the	state	of	being	in	love	(see
LOVE).	 Freud	 does	 not	 distinguish	 between	 self
and	ego	in	this	essay,	using	the	term	“ego”	as	the
term	“self’	is	used	in	ordinary	discourse.	Later,	of
course,	he	defined	ego	as	an	agency	of	the	mind,	a
set	 of	 apparatuses	 or	 functions.	 The	 student	 will
be	 less	 confused	 if	 “ego”	 in	 Freud’s	 paper	 is
thought	of	as	“self-representation.”
A	 period	 of	 autoerotism	 is	 postulated	 as	 the
very	beginning	phase	of	life,	even	before	the	nuclei
of	the	ego	have	coalesced.	Once	the	ego	has	begun
to	develop,	the	libido	is	invested	in	it;	this	is	the
phase	of	primary	narcissism,	according	to	Freud.
The	 second	 section	 of	 Freud’s	 paper	 begins
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
858
with	 a	 discussion	 of	 hypochondria,	 in	 which	 the
clinical	phenomena	of	hypochondriasis	are	seen	as
the	 result	 of	 flooding	 of	 the	 ego	 with	 libido	 that
has	been	withdrawn	from	objects.	The	flooding	of
the	 ego	 with	 libido	 appears	 in	 the	 psyche	 as
megalomania,	 and	 an	 overloading	 (or	 damming
up)	 of	 this	 withdrawn	 libido	 is	 felt	 as	 the
disagreeable	
sensations	
of	
hypochondriacal
anxiety.	No	explanation	is	available	as	to	why	the
libido-flooded	 ego	 should	 feel	 these	 disagreeable
sensations,	 but	 an	 analogy	 is	 drawn	 to	 the	 so-
called	 actual	 neuroses	 (see	 ACTUAL	 NEUROSIS),
where	 dammed	 up	 libido	 due	 to	 inadequate
discharge	leads	to	the	disagreeable	sensations	of
neurasthenia.	In	the	case	of	hypochondriasis,	the
libido	flooding	the	ego	comes	from	outside	objects
to	 which	 it	 has	 previously	 been	 cathected	 and	 is
now	 being	 withdrawn;	 in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 actual
neuroses,	 the	 libido	 comes	 from	 inside	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
859
individual	and	has	been	inadequately	discharged.
Freud	
distinguishes	
three	
groups	
of
phenomena	
in	
the	
clinical	
picture	
of
schizophrenia:	 (a)	 those	 representing	 what
remains	 of	 the	 normal	 or	 neurotic	 state	 of	 the
individual;	 (b)	 those	 representing	 detachment	 of
libido	 from	 its	 objects,	 leading	 to	 megalomania,
hypochondriasis,	
and	
regression;	
and	
(c)
restitutive	 symptoms	 in	 which	 an	 effort	 is	 made
once	again	to	attach	the	libido	to	objects	or	at	least
to	their	verbal	representations.	These	distinctions
form	 the	 foundation	 of	 Freud’s	 theory	 of
schizophrenia.
Another	 clinical	 application	 of	 the	 concept	 of
narcissism,	 the	 distinction	 between	 anaclitic	 and
narcissistic	choices	of	love	objects,	concludes	the
second	 section	 of	 this	 paper.	 The	 anaclitic	 object
choice	attempts	to	bring	back	the	lost	mother	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
860
precedes	 developmentally	 the	 narcissistic	 object
choice.	 The	 latter	 is	 a	 form	 of	 secondary
narcissism	 in	 which	 the	 person	 chosen	 to	 love
resembles	 one’s	 own	 self.	 For	 Freud,	 in	 early
development	 primary	 narcissism	 comes	 first.
Then,	due	to	inevitable	frustration,	anaclitic	object
choice	occurs,	with	the	mother	as	the	first	object.
Therefore,	 narcissistic	 object	 choice,	 when	 it
appears,	
represents	
a	
form	
of	
secondary
narcissism	 in	 which	 the	 person	 loves	 what	 he
himself	 is	 or	 was,	 what	 he	 would	 like	 to	 be,	 or
what	someone	once	thought	of	as	a	part	of	himself.
The	 final	 section	 of	 the	 essay	 begins	 with	 an
extremely	important	sentence:	“The	disturbances
to	 which	 a	 child’s	 original	 narcissism	 is	 exposed,
the	 reactions	 with	 which	 he	 seeks	 to	 protect
himself	from	them	and	the	paths	into	which	he	is
forced	 in	 doing	 so—these	 are	 themes	 which	 I
propose	to	leave	on	one	side,	as	an	important	field
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
861
of	 work	 which	 still	 awaits	 exploration”	 (p.	 92).
Kohut’s	 work	 may	 be	 understood	 as	 emanating
from	this	statement	(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).
In	this	essay,	the	aggressive	instincts	in	Freud’s
formulation	 should	 not	 be	 considered	 purely	 or
basically	 as	 sadism,	 since	 he	 conceived	 of	 them
here	 primarily	 as	 the	 will	 to	 power,	 control,	 and
dominance,	which	only	in	certain	cases	involve	a
secondary	need	to	inflict	pain.	Looking	at	it	in	this
way	we	may	say	that	when	the	ego	instincts	are
flooded	by	a	libidinal	complement	from	the	sexual
instinct,	 we	 have	 the	 clinical	 state	 of	 narcissism;
when	 the	 sexual	 instincts	 are	 infused	 by	 an
aggressive	component	from	the	ego	instincts,	we
have	the	clinical	situation	of	sexual	sadism.
What	 is	 missing	 here	 is	 the	 structural	 theory
involving	the	id,	ego,	and	superego.	A	step	in	this
direction	 is	 present	 in	 the	 essay	 on	 narcissism,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
862
where	 in	 the	 third	 part	 Freud	 introduces	 the
notion	 of	 the	 ego-ideal.	 In	 the	 course	 of
development	the	ego-ideal	becomes	infused	with
the	 subject’s	 primary	 narcissism	 “…what	 he
projects	 before	 him	 as	 his	 ideal	 is	 the	 substitute
for	the	lost	narcissism	of	his	childhood	in	which	he
was	 his	 own	 ideal”	 (p.	 94).	 This	 substitution	 is
differentiated	from	sublimation,	in	which	the	aim
of	 the	 instinct	 is	 changed,	 with	 an	 accent	 upon
deflection	from	sexuality.
It	 follows	 from	 these	 considerations	 that	 the
ego	 becomes	 impoverished	 of	 libido	 by	 either
object	 love	 or	 ego-ideal	 formation,	 and	 enriched
by	 the	 gratification	 of	 object	 love	 or	 fulfilling	 its
ideal.	 Self-esteem	 arises	 out	 of	 either	 of	 these
enrichments	 and	 contains	 three	 components:	 (a)
the	
leftover	
residue	
of	
primary	
infantile
narcissism;	
(b)	
the	
sense	
of	
omnipotence
corroborated	by	experiencing	the	fulfillment	of	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
863
ego-ideal;	and	(c)	satisfaction	of	object	libido	by	an
input	 of	 love	 from	 the	 love	 object.	 Thus	 loving,
insofar	 as	 it	 involves	 longing	 and	 deprivation,
lowers	 self-regard,	 “whereas	 being	 loved,	 having
one’s	 love	 returned,	 and	 possessing	 the	 loved
object,	 raises	 it	 once	 more”	 (p.	 99).	 Whether	 the
self	 representation	 is	 impoverished,	 as	 Freud
thought,	or	is	actually	enhanced	by	falling	in	love
remains	 highly	 controversial	 (see	 Sandler	 et	 al.
1991).
Besides	
explaining	
a	
variety	
of	
easily
observable	
everyday	
phenomena,	
these
conceptions	 have	 an	 important	 bearing	 on	 the
practice	 of	 intensive	 psychotherapy.	 It	 follows
from	them	that	if	an	individual	is	unable	to	love,
that	 is	 to	 say,	 if	 there	 is	 a	 repression	 of	 the
libidinal	drive,	only	one	source	of	self-regard	is	left
—that	of	idealization,	or	that	of	“fulfilling	the	ego-
ideal.”	 As	 Freud	 puts	 it,	 such	 persons	 tend	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
864
attach	 themselves	 to	 individuals	 who	 have
achieved	what	the	patient’s	ego-ideal	clamors	for,
who	possess	the	excellences	to	which	the	patient
cannot	attain.	This	represents	a	cure	by	love	and	is
the	kind	of	expectation	that	often	directs	patients
into	psychotherapy.	For	certain	patients,	then,	an
important	 unconscious	 motivation	 for	 seeking
therapy	 is	 to	 develop	 an	 attachment	 to	 the
assumed	successful	person	of	the	psychotherapist,
who	 has	 achieved	 the	 aims	 of	 the	 patient’s	 ego-
ideal.	 This	 carries	 the	 temptation	 to	 form	 a
crippling	 and	 permanent	 dependence	 on	 the
psychotherapist,	 and	 also	 contains	 the	 further
danger	 that	 when	 some	 capacity	 to	 love	 is
developed	through	the	psychotherapy	the	patient
will	 withdraw	 from	 the	 treatment	 and	 choose	 a
love	 object	 still	 permeated	 by	 the	 patient’s	 ego-
ideal,	 a	 phenomenon	 that	 Freud	 calls	 a	 cure	 by
love.	The	disadvantage	of	this	is	that	the	crippling
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
865
dependence	 is	 then	 transferred	 to	 this	 new	 love
object,	 and	 we	 observe	 the	 clinical	 phenomena
that	
Odier	
(1956)	
called	
the	
neurosis	
of
abandonment	(see	ABANDONMENT	NEUROSIS).
A	 final	 important	 hint	 leading	 to	 the	 work	 of
Kohut	 is	 presented	 at	 the	 end	 of	 this	 essay,	 in
which	it	is	noted	that	an	injury	to	self-esteem	or
self-regard—what	
today	
we	
would	
call	
a
narcissistic	 wound—is	 often	 found	 as	
the
precipitating	 cause	 of	 paranoia.	 The	 reason	 for
this,	from	the	above	considerations,	would	be	that
any	 falling	 short	 of	 the	 ego-ideal,	 or	 any
disappointment	 or	 depletion	 in	 the	 libidinal
complement	of	the	ego,	would	cause	a	withdrawal
of	 the	 libido	 from	 objects,	 with	 the	 subsequent
clinical	 phenomena	 of	 hypochondriasis	 and
megalomania.
Freud’s	theory	distinguishes	between	primary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
866
narcissism,	 which	 precedes	 loving	 others,	 and
secondary	 narcissism,	 which	 results	 from	 a
withdrawal	of	love	that	was	previously	invested	in
external	 objects.	 A	 certain	 amount	 of	 primary
narcissism	 remains	 invested	 with	 the	 ego	 and	 is
healthy	and	necessary.	A	narcissistic	wound	is	an
injury	 to	 self-esteem;	 narcissistic	 supplies	 are
behaviors	 and	 statements	 and	 fantasies	 that
enhance	 self-esteem.	 Freud	 regarded	 the	 clinical
states	 of	 depression	 and	 schizophrenia	 as
“narcissistic	 neuroses,”	 by	 which	 he	 implied	 that
patients	 with	 these	 conditions	 could	 not	 form	 a
transference.	
This	
has	
subsequently	
been
disproved,	 so	 the	 separation	 of	 narcissistic
neuroses	as	opposed	to	transference	neuroses	or
psychoneuroses	has	been	dropped.
There	 are	 various	 contradictions	 in	 Freud’s
theory.	For	example,	in	his	later	writings,	such	as
The	 Ego	 and	 the	 Id	 (1923),	 he	 stated	 that	 in	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
867
beginning	 all	 libido	 is	 stored	 in	 the	 id	 and
therefore	 whatever	 is	 drawn	 into	 the	 ego	 as
narcissism	 is	 secondary.	 By	 this	 theory	 there
would	 be	 no	 such	 thing	 as	 primary	 narcissism,
although	 Freud	 continued	 to	 refer	 to	 it.	 There	 is
also	further	confusion	in	that	at	various	times	in
later	writings	Freud	implied	object	love	to	be	most
primary	
and	
the	
most	
primitive	
type	
of
relationship	 to	 the	 environment,	 while	 at	 other
times	 he	 stated	 narcissism	 was	 characteristic	 of
the	 most	 primitive	 type	 of	 relationship.	 The
general	trend	in	Freud’s	development	(Greenberg
and	 Mitchell	 1983)	 was	 toward	 an	 increasing
emphasis	on	object	relations	early	in	life	and	away
from	the	notion	of	a	primary	autistic	and	primary
narcissistic	 phase.	 Etchegoyen	 (Sandler	 et	 al.
1991)	 claims	 that	 “the	 proposition	 of	 a	 primary
narcissism	as	the	starting	point	of	psychic	life	is	at
the	 root	 of	 the	 fundamental	 controversies	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
868
psychoanalysis	today”	(p.	54).
Klein	defines	narcissism	as	identification	with
the	 good	 object	 and	 the	 denial	 of	 any	 difference
between	one’s	self	and	the	good	object.	There	is	no
“primary”	 narcissism	 (Greenberg	 and	 Mitchell
1983).	 This	 definition	 is	 used	 to	 explain	 the
clinical	 phenomena	 of	 narcissism	 and	 should	 be
distinguished	from	narcissistic	internal	structures
and	 narcissistic	 object	 relationships,	 which	 are
based	 on	 projective	 identification.	 Segal	 (1980)
calls	 attention	 to	 Klein’s	 differentiation	 between
narcissistic	
states,	
which	
are	
states	
of
identification	 with	 an	 internal	 ideal	 object	 and
correspond	
to	
what	
Freud	
described	
as
autoerotism,	
and	
the	
postulated	
complex
narcissistic	 object	 relationships	 of	 the	 infant,
which	
contain	
the	
internal	
phantasies	
of
introjection	 and	 projection	 as	 described	 above.
Each	 relationship	 is	 based	 primarily	 on	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
869
interaction	between	the	individual	and	projected
aspects	 of	 that	 same	 individual,	 which	 the
individual	 experiences	 as	 belonging	 to	 another
person.	 In	 addition	 to	 splitting,	 idealization
preserves	“all	good”	internal	and	external	objects;
when	this	breaks	down,	there	appears	the	fear	of
destruction	 from	 within	 as	 well	 as	 destruction
from	without.
Kohut	(1971)	at	first	postulated	a	separate	line
of	development	for	narcissistic	libido.	In	fact,	the
term	 “narcissistic”	 has	 been	 employed	 in	 the
literature	to	denote	a	sexual	perversion,	a	state	of
development,	a	type	of	libido,	a	method	of	object
choice,	 a	 mode	 of	 relating	 to	 the	 environment,	 a
personality	 characteristic,	 and	 a	 reference	 to	 the
state	of	one’s	self-esteem.	In	clinical	use	I	think	it
best	to	confine	this	term	to	the	last	of	these	usages
and	 to	 especially	 avoid	 using	 it	 in	 a	 pejorative
sense.	 The	 problem	 of	 depleted	 self-esteem	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
870
the	person’s	defenses	against	it	or	compensations
for	 it	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 common	 and	 important
clinical	 problems	 in	 psychoanalytical	 treatment
today.	 It	 is	 to	 the	 credit	 of	 the	 self	 psychologists
that	 they	 have	 focused	 our	 attention	 on	 this
matter.	 Whereas	 classical	 psychoanalysts	 view
narcissistic	 phenomena	 either	 as	 a	 fixation	 at	 an
early	developmental	stage	or	as	a	defense	against
anxieties	associated	with	instinctual	strivings,	self
psychologists	 view	 narcissistic	 phenomena	 as
manifestations	of	an	enfeebled	self	resulting	from
important	 selfobject	 failures	 or	 as	 a	 defense
against	anxieties	associated	with	the	expression	of
selfobject	needs.

NARCISSISTIC	RAGE
Kohut’s	(1978)	most	remarkable	single	clinical
paper,	 “Thoughts	 on	 Narcissism	 and	 Narcissistic
Rage,”	 was	 first	 published	 in	 1972.	 Kohut	 begins
by	 reminding	 us	 of	 Heinrich	 Von	 Kleist’s	 story
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
872
“Michael	 Kohlhaas,”	 which	 was	 written	 in	 1808
and	 describes	 the	 insatiable	 search	 for	 revenge
after	 a	 narcissistic	 injury.	 In	 this	 story,	 as	 in	 the
novel	Moby	Dick,	written	in	1851,	the	protagonist
is	“in	the	grip	of	an	interminable	narcissistic	rage”
(Kohut	 1978	 p.	 617)	 and	 thirst	 for	 revenge	 that
eventually	results	in	the	destruction	of	everybody.
For	 Kohut,	 aggression	 is	 a	 function	 of
narcissistic	 rage	 and	 can	 actually	 be	 most	 lethal
when	 carried	 out	 in	 the	 form	 of	 orderly	 and
organized	activities.	Narcissistic	rage	ranges	from
fleeting	 annoyance	 when	 a	 greeting	 is	 not
reciprocated	or	a	joke	not	appreciated	to	catatonic
furor	 or	 the	 murderous	 grudges	 of	 a	 paranoiac.
The	 crucial	 aspect	 of	 narcissistic	 rage	 is	 the
obsessive	 need	 for	 revenge,	 to	 undo	 a	 hurt	 by
whatever	 means,	 and	 an	 unrelenting	 compulsion
to	pursue	this	aim	that	gives	no	rest	to	those	who
have	suffered	a	narcissistic	injury.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
873
Narcissistic	injuries,	such	as	ridicule,	contempt,
conspicuous	defeat,	and	insult,	may	sometimes	be
undone	psychologically	by	the	use	of	identification
with	the	aggressor.	In	this	situation	the	wounded
individual	begins	to	inflict	on	others	those	injuries
the	 person	 is	 most	 afraid	 of.	 For	 example,	 one
observes	 sadism	 in	 a	 patient	 treated	 sadistically
by	 his	 or	 her	 parents	 or	 a	 psychoanalyst	 who	 is
sarcastic	 and	 sadistic	 toward	 his	 patients,	 who
was	 so	 treated	 by	 his	 parents	 or	 by	 his	 training
analyst.
In	 narcissistic	 rage	 there	 is	 a	 total	 lack	 of
empathy	 for	 the	 offender,	 an	 unforgiving	 fury.
Even	 psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis	 can	 be
experienced	as	a	narcissistic	injury	and	give	rise	to
the	 most	 severe	 narcissistic	 resistances	 in	 such
patients	because	it	implies	either	that	the	patient
is	not	in	full	control	of	his	or	her	mind	or	that	the
therapist	 knows	 something	 the	 patient	 does	 not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
874
know,	or	is	not	totally	available	to	the	patient.
Abraham	(1919)	was	the	first	psychoanalyst	to
point	out	how	there	are	some	patients	for	whom
every	
psychoanalytic	
insight	
represents	
a
humiliation.	They	identify	with	their	physician	and
want	 to	 do	 the	 treatment	 all	 by	 themselves;	 the
aim	of	cure	retreats	to	the	background.	Abraham
relates	 this	 to	 narcissism	 and	 points	 out	 how
quickly	 these	 patients	 are	 disappointed	 at	 any
imperfection	 in	 the	 analyst.	 He	 recommends	 an
exhaustive	analysis	of	their	narcissistic	problems.
The	 most	 lethal	 situation	 of	 all	 is	 chronic
narcissistic	rage.	If	acute	narcissistic	rage	does	not
subside,	the	ego	becomes	more	and	more	pulled	in
to	 reestablish	 control	 over	 the	 world.	 The	 whole
personality	and	its	functions	gets	pulled	into	this
effort.	Reasoning	capacity	becomes	surrendered	to
rationalizing	 persistent	 insistence	 on	 limitless
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
875
power.	Failures	are	not	seen	as	due	to	limits	but	as
due	 to	 the	 malevolence	 and	 the	 corruption	 of
uncooperative	 selfobjects,	 a	 malevolence	 and
corruption	that	must	be	overcome	at	all	costs.
Kohut	suggests	that	when	chronic	narcissistic
rage	 is	 blocked	 from	 being	 directed	 at	 the
offending	selfobject	it	may	shift	its	focus	and	aim
at	either	the	self	or	the	body	self.	The	former	leads
to	
a	
self-destructive	
depression	
and	
self-
destructive	behavior	that	is	chronic	in	nature,	and
the	latter	may	lead	to	psychosomatic	illness	after	a
chronic	period.

NARRATIVE	TRUTH
Spence	 (1982)	 reminds	 us	 that	 the	 data	 of
psychoanalysis	 are	 not	 self-evident.	 Putting
images	and	pictures	into	words	is	such	a	complex
process	 that	 it	 involves	 choice	 and	 creation,	 the
work	 of	 the	 poet,	 artist,	 and	 aesthetician.	 Given
this,	 how	 can	 psychoanalytic	 explanation	 and
research	occur?
A	narrative	must	be	persuasive	and	search	for
coherence	 and	 meaning.	 Each	 interpretation,
claimed	 Freud,	 contains	 a	 kernel	 of	 historical
truth,	and	this	is	why	it	works.	Spence	argues	that
the	 unconscious	 is	 not	 language	 but	 rather
experiences	 waiting	 expression.	 Listening	 to
narratives	 is	 what	 we	 do.	 A	 shared	 language
develops	 over	 time	 pari	 passu	 with	 the	 analyst’s
active	 listening	 search	 for	 meaning.	 The	 analyst
watches	 for	 thematic	 unity,	 significant	 meanings,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
877
manifestations	 of	 transference,	 and	 multiple
meanings,	and	also	attempts	to	be	empathic	with
the	 patient.	 But	 the	 analyst	 is	 always	 making
decisions	based	on	this	search.
The	 narrative	 truth	 of	 an	 interpretation	 is
marked	 by	 clinical	 parsimony,	 the	 idea	 that	 a
similar	 form	 suggests	 a	 similar	 content,	 and
implies	a	pattern	match	of	cause	and	effect.	Why
do	 these	 interpretations	 work?	 According	 to
Spence,	 the	 narrative	 truths	 of	 interpretations
help	patients	“see”	by	the	right	words,	present	a
coherent	account,	remove	responsibility,	and	have
no	 evidence	 against	 them.	 An	 undocumented
assertion	acquires	a	life	of	its	own.	Therefore,	for
Spence,	all	interpretations	are	“inexact”	and	some
are	
more	
creative	
than	
others.	
In	
all
interpretations	 we	 exchange	 narrative	 truth	 for
historical	
truth.	
Spence	
stresses	
the
interpretations’	“poetic	value”	and	concludes	that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
878
each	psychoanalyst	“hears”	material	in	his	or	her
own	way	(see	LISTENING).	For	Spence,	historical
truth	 is	 unimportant	 in	 psychoanalysis,	 for
psychoanalysis	is	not	a	science.

NEGATIVE	THERAPEUTIC	REACTION
This	 concept	 is	 often	 blamed	 when	 a	 poor
interpretation	is	followed	by	a	deterioration	of	the
patient’s	condition.	However,	this	is	not	a	negative
therapeutic	 reaction	 and,	 if	 it	 is	 so	 labeled,	 the
therapist	is	indulging	in	a	form	of	self-justification.
The	correct	meaning	of	a	negative	therapeutic
reaction	 is	 a	 paradoxical	 deterioration	 in	 the
patient’s	condition	as	the	consequence	of	a	proper
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
879
interpretation,	 a	 situation	 in	 which	 one	 would
expect	
to	
see	
improvement	
rather	
than
deterioration.	There	are	two	common	reasons	for
this	 to	 occur.	 First,	 the	 patient	 may	 be	 suffering
from	moral	masochism	(see	MASOCHISM)	so	that
getting	 well	 is	 interfered	 with	 by	 the	 patient’s
unconscious	 guilt	 and	 need	 to	 stay	 sick	 and	 be
punished.	Second,	the	patient	may	be	humiliated;	a
correct	interpretation	indicates	that	the	therapist
knows	more	than	the	patient.	The	content	of	the
interpretation	is	not	heard,	and	instead	is	simply
experienced	 as	 a	 narcissistic	 wound,	 generating
narcissistic	rage.
There	are	some	patients	who	can	express	their
aggression	 only	 by	 stalemating	 or	 defeating	 the
treatment.	This	may	manifest	itself	in	the	negative
therapeutic	 reaction,	 as	 Freud	 (1923,	 1924)
described	it.	Negative	therapeutic	reaction	should
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
negative
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
880
transference.	 In	 the	 negative	 transference,	 the
patient	is	so	angry	at	the	therapist	that	he	or	she
automatically	 rejects	 anything	 the	 therapist	 may
have	to	say.	In	addition,	the	patient	may	manifest	a
strong	 need	 to	 puncture,	 wound,	 and	 defeat	 the
therapist.

NEUROSIS
This	 term	 dates	 from	 the	 second	 half	 of	 the
eighteenth	 century,	 when	 it	 was	 considered	 a
disease	of	the	nerves;	in	the	nineteenth	century	it
was	 used	 to	 describe	 diseases	 believed	 due	 to
functional	 physiological	 disturbances	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
881
nervous	system	without	any	identifiable	structural
change	in	the	tissue.
Freud	gave	new	life	to	the	meaning	of	neurosis
in	 his	 early	 work.	 He	 (1895a)	 attempted	 to
distinguish	 the	 actual	 neurosis	 (see	 ACTUAL
NEUROSIS)	from	psychoneuroses	on	the	basis	that
in	 the	 former,	 the	 symptoms	 were	 due	 to
unhealthy	 sexual	 practices	 in	 which	 there	 was	 a
“damming	 up”	 of	 libido	 due	 to	 an	 inadequate
sexual	 discharge.	 The	 psychoneuroses,	 on	 the
other	hand,	arose	as	the	result	of	mental	conflict.
The	term	“neurosis”	was	dropped	from	DSM-III-R
(1987)	 in	 order	 to	 avoid	 the	 implication	 of	 a
psychodynamic	etiology	that	Freud	emphasized.
From	 the	 clinical	 point	 of	 view,	 the	 neuroses
are	 disorders	 in	 which	 ego-alien	 and	 distressing
symptoms	such	as	anxieties,	phobias,	obsessions,
compulsions,	 hysterical	 conversion,	 dissociative
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
882
phenomena,	 and	 other	 manifestations	 appear.
Some	authors	divided	neurotic	patients	into	those
who	 have	 neuroses	 in	 which	 the	 symptoms	 are
“autoplastic”	 and	 those	 who	 have	 neurotic
character	 disorders,	 in	 which	 the	 symptoms	 are
alloplastic	 (see	 ALLOPLASTIC).	 The	 latter	 are
usually	today	referred	to	as	DSM-III-R	personality
disorders.
Using	 Freud’s	 (1926)	 mature	 signal	 theory	 of
anxiety	 (see	 ANXIETY),	 the	 psychoneuroses	 are
thought	to	develop	somewhat	as	follows:	A	serious
stressful,	 traumatic,	 or	 frustrating	 situation	 is
endured	by	the	patient.	This	leads	to	regression	to
earlier	 levels	 of	 psychosexual	 development	 in
which	 the	 patient	 was	 either	 fixated	 due	 to
overindulgence	or	unable	to	resolve	due	to	lack	of
proper	 gratification.	 The	 regression	 to	 an	 earlier
stage	 of	 development	 stirs	 up	 the	 early	 infantile
wishes	connected	with	that	stage	of	development.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
883
These	wishes	conflict	strongly	with	the	superego,
as	well	as	with	the	reality	of	the	patient’s	adult	life.
This	conflict	generates	anxiety,	the	signal	for	the
ego	 that	 the	 repression	 of	 these	 early	 infantile
wishes	is	inadequate.	To	remove	anxiety,	the	ego
must	produce	a	compromise	formation	using	the
mechanisms	 of	 defense	 that	 permits	 a	 distorted
expression	and	partial	gratification	of	the	infantile
wishes	 but	 also	 contains	 a	 punishment.	 There	 is
often	a	secondary	gain	from	being	ill.	(For	details
see	Alexander	1948.)
In	the	psychoanalytic	process	the	wishes	that
are	central	to	the	particular	neurosis	being	treated
become	 aimed	 for	 discharge	 at	 the	 object
representation	of	the	psychoanalyst	and	cross	the
repression	barrier	in	this	fashion.	This	constitutes
the	 transference	 (see	 TRANSFERENCE),	 and
through	analysis	the	patient	can	become	aware	of
the	 disturbing	 infantile	 wishes.	 Such	 wishes	 can
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
884
now	be	dealt	with	by	the	adult	ego	so	that	better
compromise	 formations	 can	 be	 formed,	 thus
allowing	 the	 patient	 a	 relief	 of	 symptoms	 and	 a
better	 level	 of	 adaptive	 functioning.	 Freud
believed	that	certain	types	of	neurotic	disorders,
the	psychoneuroses,	readily	formed	transferences.
In	his	early	work	Freud	(1895b)	believed	that
a	neurosis	has	multiple	causation:
1.	hereditary	disposition;
2.	 specific	 cause—factors	 without	 which	 the
neurosis	cannot	occur;
3.	 contributory	 or	 ancillary	 causes—any	 other
factors	that	may	or	may	not	be	present	and
contribute	
toward	
overloading	
the
nervous	system;
4.	 exciting	 or	 releasing	 cause:	 the	 traumatic
events	 immediately	 followed	 by	 the
appearance	of	the	neurosis.
This	
formulation	
represents	
Freud	
in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
885
transition	 from	 a	 neurological	 to	 a	 purely
psychological	understanding	of	the	neuroses.	The
specific	cause	determines	more	than	anything	the
type	of	neurosis;	whether	a	neurotic	illness	occurs
at	 all	 depends	 on	 the	 total	 load	 on	 the	 nervous
system	in	relation	to	its	capacity	to	carry	this	load.
The	
early	
classification	
based	
on	
this
formulation	is	as	follows:
ACTUAL	NEUROSES	(due	to	organic	causes)
1.	 Neurasthenia	 proper—due	 to	 inadequate
“abnormal”	 discharge	 of	 sexual	 excitation
(e.g.,	masturbation).
2.	Anxiety	neurosis—due	to	blockage	of	sexual
discharge	 and	 deflection	 into	 morbid
anxiety	
(e.g.,	
abstinence	
or	
coitus
interruptus).
TRANSFERENCE	NEUROSES	(psychoneuroses)
1.	 Hysteria—due	 to	 childhood	 sexual	 traumata
of	a	passive	nature,	imposed	on	the	child
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
886
quite	early.
2.	 Obsessive-compulsive	 neuroses	 (including
phobias)—due	 to	 the	 above	 plus	 later	 a
superimposed,	 more	 pleasant	 aggressive
sexual	activity	in	childhood.
NARCISSISTIC	NEUROSES
1.	Depression
2.	Paraphrenia	(a	term	Freud	preferred,	loosely
representing	schizophrenia).
Certain	 other	 types	 of	 neurosis	 have	 been
labeled	 in	 the	 literature.	 In	 the	 fate	 neurosis,	 for
example,	 the	 individual,	 because	 of	 unconscious
guilt,	 always	 seems	 to	 fail.	 The	 neurosis	 of
abandonment	has	been	described	elsewhere	(see
ABANDONMENT	 NEUROSIS).	 Since	 Freud’s	 day
the	 term	 “neurosis”	 is	 attached	 to	 many	 other
conditions	 and	 has	 acquired	 a	 loose	 and	 general
meaning,	implying	an	emotional	illness	that	is	less
severe	than	a	psychosis	because	reality	testing	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
887
better	preserved,	and	with	autoplastic	symptoms
predominating,	 in	 contrast	 to	 the	 personality
disorders,	where	alloplastic	symptoms	are	typical
(see	
DEPRESSION,	
HYSTERIA,	
MASOCHISM,
NARCISSISM,	
OBSESSIONAL	
NEUROSIS,	
and
PANIC	DISORDER).
The	 clinician	 must	 pick	 and	 choose	 among
these	 definitions.	 There	 is	 little	 reason	 to	 retain
Freud’s	 concept	 of	 the	 actual	 neuroses.	 We	 now
know	
that	
depressions,	
schizophrenias,
conversion	
hysterias,	
phobias,	
obsessive-
compulsive	 disorders,	 narcissistic	 disorders,	 and
anxiety	 disorders	 are	 all	 situations	 in	 which	 the
patient	is	capable	of	forming	a	transference	of	one
kind	or	the	other.	I	personally	prefer	to	retain	the
concept	 of	 neurosis	 for	 all	 of	 these	 but	 the
psychotic	 disorders	 because	 it	 reminds	 me	 that
there	is	an	orderly	sequence	of	intrapsychic	events
that	 takes	 place	 resulting	 in	 the	 formation	 of	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
888
neurosis,	and	it	helps	in	the	search	to	unravel	this
sequence	 of	 events.	 The	 DSM-III-R	 use	 of
substitute	terminology	for	these	conditions,	on	the
other	 hand,	 emphasizes	 the	 organic	 possibilities
for	 etiology	 of	 these	 conditions	 and	 suggests
psychopharmacologic	 treatment	 for	 short-term
symptomatic	relief.	Much	of	the	choice	is	based	on
the	preferences,	temperament,	and	orientation	of
the	 psychiatrist	 in	 these	 matters	 and	 will	 be
reflected	in	the	therapist’s	approach	to	his	or	her
patients.	 It	 is	 both	 inappropriate	 and	 dangerous
for	 a	 therapist	 to	 embark	 on	 the	 long-term
intensive	 psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis	 of
neurotic	 patients	 without	 a	 thorough	 personal
psychoanalysis.

NEUTRALITY
It	 has	 always	 been	 recommended	 that	 the
analyst	 be	 neutral	 with	 respect	 to	 his	 or	 her
approach	 to	 the	 patient	 and	 refrain	 from	 value
judgments.	It	is	wise	to	keep	in	mind	Anna	Freud’s
suggestion	 to	 try	 to	 remain	 equidistant	 from	 the
patient’s	id,	ego,	and	superego.	For	the	therapist,
neutrality	 involves	 a	 physicianly	 vocation	 and	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
890
stance	of	professional	commitment	to	the	patient,
at	the	same	time,	the	therapist	should	not	become
overly	detached	or	overly	involved	in	the	patient’s
life	(see	PHYSICIANLY	VOCATION).
Neutrality	has	sometimes	been	confused	with	a
cold	withdrawal	from	the	patient’s	suffering	that
usually	 results	 in	 an	 iatrogenic	 narcissistic
neurosis	 in	 the	 patient	 or,	 if	 the	 patient	 is
borderline,	explosions	of	rage	and	acting	out.	This
is	
simply	
a	
reaction	
to	
the	
analyst’s
countertransference	
and	
is	
not	
a	
correct
understanding	 of	 neutrality.	 It	 most	 commonly
occurs	in	frightened	beginners	who	are	trying	to
imitate	some	kind	of	caricature	of	Freud	that	they
have	 in	 mind.	 Freud	 was	 anything	 but	 cold	 and
withdrawn	with	his	patients,	and	a	careful	study	of
his	 case	 histories	 shows	 how	 professionally	 he
was	 able	 to	 interact	 on	 a	 warm	 basis	 with	 his
patients	 yet	 for	 the	 most	 part	 maintain	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
891
professional	distance	and	neutrality	with	respect
to	 their	 struggle	 and	 demands	 (Lipton	 1977,
1979).	Neutrality	should	not	be	confused	with	the
rule	of	abstinence	(see	ABSTINENCE).
The	 great	 value	 of	 neutrality	 is	 that	 it
encourages	 the	 patient’s	 free	 association	 and
expression	of	many	embarrassing	and	very	private
thoughts	 and	 fantasies.	 It	 is	 not	 too	 much	 to	 say
that	 an	 orderly	 psychoanalytic	 psychotherapy
cannot	occur	if	the	therapist	is	unable	to	maintain
a	 position	 of	 professional	 neutrality.	 It	 is	 fitting
that	Freud	(1915)	first	used	the	term	in	his	paper
on	 transference	 love.	 Of	 course,	 neutrality	 also
requires	the	analyst	to	be	reasonably	neutral	with
respect	to	religious,	ethical,	and	social	values;	he
or	she	must	not	direct	the	treatment	according	to
some	personal	ideals	and	is	expected	not	to	read
particular	
idiosyncratic	
meanings	
into	
the
patient’s	 free	 association	 according	 to	 his	 or	 her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
892
theoretical	
preconceptions.	
It	
is	
generally
recognized	 that	 no	 therapist	 can	 be	 completely
neutral,	 yet	 it	 is	 also	 agreed	 that	 neutrality	 is	 a
most	important	goal	for	the	therapist	to	strive	to
maintain.
De	 la	 Torre	 (1977)	 points	 out	 that	 the	 more
treatment	
departs	
from	
a	
psychoanalytic
framework,	 the	 less	 neutrality	 can	 be	 preserved.
The	successful	achievement	of	neutrality	pivots	on
the	analyst’s	self-analysis	and	understanding	of	his
or	 her	 countertransference.	 For	 De	 la	 Torre,	 it
involves	
three	
components:	
abstinence,
anonymity,	 and	 the	 proper	 balance	 of	 passivity
and	 activity.	 Leider	 (1983,	 1984)	 presents	 a
thorough	 review	 and	 discussion	 of	 analytic
neutrality.

NEUTRALIZATION
Hartmann	and	colleagues	(1949)	described	the
process	 by	 which	 infantile	 sexual	 and	 aggressive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
894
energies	are	desexualized	and	deaggressified.	The
result	is	neutralized	energy	that	can	then	be	used
for	 the	 autonomous	 functions	 of	 the	 ego.	 This
concept,	 which	 is	 highly	 metapsychological,	 has
fallen	 into	 disuse	 in	 the	 literature	 as	 ego
psychology	has	become	less	fashionable	and	drive
psychology	has	been	challenged.
Hartmann	 and	 colleagues	 offer	 a	 splendid
discussion	
of	
aggression	
from	
the	
drive
psychology	 point	 of	 view,	 and	 their	 work	 has
considerable	 clinical	 importance.	 For	 example,
“the	 capacity	 to	 neutralize	 large	 quantities	 of
aggression	 may	 constitute	 one	 of	 the	 criteria	 of
‘ego	strength’	or	of	the	high	capacity	of	the	ego	for
integration.	 Alternatively,	 the	 internalization	 of
nonneutralized	aggressive	energy	in	the	ego	may
be	 the	 hallmark	 of	 a	 weak,	 or	 eventually	 of	 a
masochistic,	 ego”	 (p.	 24).	 The	 authors	 also	 point
out	the	important	clinical	phenomenon	that	occurs

895
in	regression,	a	breakdown	of	this	neutralization
and	 disruption	 of	 the	 balance	 of	 libidinal	 and
aggressive	energies.

NIRVANA	PRINCIPLE
Freud	(1920)	adopted	this	term	in	“Beyond	the
Pleasure	 Principle”	 to	 denote	 the	 presumed
tendency	 of	 the	 psychic	 apparatus	 to	 reduce	 the
quantity	of	excitation	in	itself	to	zero	or	to	as	low	a
level	as	possible.	This	concept,	which	Freud	went
on	to	use	in	his	arguments	for	the	death	instinct,
has	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 wrong	 as	 demonstrated	 by
both	neurophysiological	and	infant	research.	It	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
896
now	 clear	 that	 from	 birth	 the	 mental	 apparatus
seeks	a	certain	optimal	level	of	stimulation;	when
that	level	is	too	high,	there	is	a	malfunctioning,	but
when	 that	 level	 is	 too	 low,	 there	 is	 an	 active
seeking	for	stimulation.	So,	for	example,	neglected
infants	 who	 receive	 an	 abnormally	 low	 level	 of
required	 stimulation	 may	 spend	 their	 time
banging	 their	 heads	 on	 the	 crib	 or	 chewing	 on
their	 own	 skin,	 and	 so	 forth,	 in	 an	 effort	 to	 feel
alive	 and	 stimulated.	 The	 chronic	 masturbation
often	 observed	 on	 the	 neglected	 back	 wards	 of
mental	hospitals	is	another	example	of	attempts	at
self-stimulation	 when	 the	 level	 of	 tension	 in	 the
mental	apparatus	becomes	too	low.	Nobody	at	the
present	time	believes	that	the	nirvana	principle	is
a	 correct	 neurophysiological	 description	 of	 the
functioning	of	the	nervous	system.
The	nirvana	principle	often	becomes	confused
with	 the	 constancy	 principle.	 This,	 according	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
897
Freud,	 refers	 to	 a	 homeostatic	 mechanism	 that
attempts	to	maintain	excitation	at	as	constant	and
low	a	level	as	possible.	The	constancy	principle	for
Freud	 evolved	 into	 the	 pleasure	 principle,	 which
assumed	 that	 pleasure	 is	 produced	 by	 the
discharge	 of	 psychic	 energy.	 This	 is	 simply
inconsistent	 with	 clinical	 observation	 since,	 for
example,	 sexual	 behavior	 involves	 a	 pleasurable
accumulation	 of	 energy	 that	 is	 deliberately
withheld	 from	 discharge	 for	 a	 certain	 period	 of
time	 to	 accentuate	 the	 pleasure.	 Freud	 never
satisfactorily	
resolved	
this	
inconsistency,
mentioning	 that	 perhaps	 another	 factor,	 such	 as
the	rhythm	of	accumulation	and	discharge,	could
be	operative.
Removing	the	metapsychological	aspect	of	this
concept,	 which	 is	 clearly	 obsolete,	 an	 important
clinical	 fact	 still	 remains.	 The	 most	 intense
pleasure	that	a	human	being	is	capable	of	having,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
898
as	 Freud	 pointed	 out,	 is	 the	 preferably	 sudden
discharge	 of	 long-dammed-up	 infantile	 wishes
often	 in	 their	 most	 primitive	 and	 archaic	 form.
There	 are	 some	 marvelous	 literary	 examples	 of
this	in	which	an	individual	who	has	led	an	ascetic
and	 carefully	 organized	 life	 suddenly	 is	 seduced
and	becomes	utterly	dependent	on	this	incredibly
intense	pleasure.	Clinical	work	with	addicts	often
flounders	on	the	fact	that	the	ordinary	sublimated
pleasures	of	civilization	are	pale	compared	to	the
sudden	rush	of	pleasure	that	is	experienced	upon
the	ingestion	of	an	addicting	substance.
Life,	very	much	as	Freud	described	it,	becomes
a	 matter	 of	 having	 to	 trade	 off	 the	 intense
pleasures	 of	 sudden	 discharge	 of	 dammed-up
archaic	 wishes	 for	 more	 modest	 pleasures	 and
sublimations,	which	carry	with	them	far	less	of	a
destructive	
potential	
to	
the	
individual.	
In
hedonistic	or	narcissistic	or	Alexandrian	cultures
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
899
this	becomes	almost	impossible	for	many	people;
it	is	a	vexatious	burden	for	the	ego	even	under	the
best	 of	 circumstances.	 Yet	 the	 survival	 of
interpersonal	 civility,	 indeed	 all	 civilization,
depends	on	it.	The	power	of	Freud’s	drive	theory
and	of	Spengler’s	(1962)	description	of	the	phases
of	 cultures	 (see	 CORRUPTION)	 to	 explain	 the
realities	 of	 our	 lives	 and	 our	 history	 tends	 to	 be
ignored	because	these	theories	are	not	fashionable
today.	That	does	not	mean	they	are	wrong.

O
OBJECT,
OBJECT	REPRESENTATION,
TRANSITIONAL	OBJECT
The	 term	 “object”	 has	 been	 used	 in	 many
senses	in	the	literature.	Generally,	it	denotes	that
toward	 which	 action	 or	 desire	 is	 directed.	 In
Freud’s	theory	every	instinct	has	a	source,	an	aim,
and	an	object,	where	the	object	is	interchangeable
as	 long	 as	 it	 serves	 a	 suitable	 purpose	 for	 the
discharge	 of	 the	 instinct.	 One	 of	 the	 biggest
arguments	in	the	field	today	is	over	whether	the
infant	 is	 or	 is	 not	 object-related	 at	 birth.	 If	 it	 is,
then	 there	 are	 certain	 specific	 objects,	 primarily
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
901
the	mother,	that	become	required	for	the	infant’s
satisfactory	existence.	The	concept	of	the	infant	as
a	 bundle	 of	 instincts	 has	 been	 replaced	 by	 such
approaches	 as	 Winnicott’s	 (1965a)	 notion	 of	 the
“nursing	couple”	(p.	15).
A	 careful	 review	 of	 the	 concept	 “object”	 in
psychoanalysis	 (Compton	 1986)	 reveals	 it	 to	 be
ambiguous.	 A	 whole	 object	 is	 recognized	 as	 a
person,	 while	 a	 part	 object	 (Klein)	 is	 part	 of	 a
person	 (e.g.,	 breast,	 penis)	 treated	 as	 a	 need-
satisfying	 object.	 A	 “bad”	 object	 is	 one	 that	 the
infant	 hates	 or	 fears	 and/or	 is	 experienced	 as
malevolent	 either	 directly	 or	 by	 projection.	 A
“good”	 object	 is	 experienced	 as	 loving	 and
gratifying	
and	
is	
required	
to	
neutralize
experiences	 or	 internal	 representations	 of	 “bad”
objects.	Internal	objects	are	phantasies1	of	whole
or	 part	 objects,	 rather	 concretized	 by	 Kleinians
(see	KLEIN)	in	contrast	to	others	who	use	the	term
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
902
“object	representation”	for	a	similar	concept.
There	 is	 considerable	 confusion	 in	 the
literature	
between	
“object”	
and	
“object
representation.”	 An	 object	 representation	 is	 the
mental	 representation	 or	 image	 of	 an	 object.	 If
metapsychology	 is	 to	 be	 followed	 properly,	 all
cathexes	are	to	the	object	representation,	not	the
object	itself.	Otherwise	one	would	have	to	imagine
mental	 energy	 being	 attached	 to	 structures
outside	 the	 psychic	 apparatus.	 Similarly,	 object
love	 represents	 libidinal	 energy	 attached	 to	 an
object	outside	the	individual,	but	more	precisely	to
the	psychic	representation	of	that	object.
The	 transitional	 object	 was	 described	 by
Winnicott	 (1953,	 1965a,b,	 1971)	 and	 refers	 to
some	literal	physical	object	that	the	child	treats	as
an	 extension	 or	 substitute	 for	 the	 mother.	 It	 is
usually	 a	 piece	 of	 cloth	 that	 the	 child	 uses	 as	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
903
comforter	 and	 stands	 midway	 between	 the
narcissistic	 love	 of	 the	 mother	 as	 a	 selfobject
(what	 Winnicott	 calls	 a	 “subjective	 object”)	 and
the	 actual	 capacity	 for	 mature	 object	 love.	 For
Winnicott,	 this	 emphasizes	 the	 infant’s	 use	 of
illusion	 in	 an	 intermediate	 area	 between	 psychic
reality	 and	 objective	 reality,	 of	 great	 importance
for	healthy	development.

OBJECT	RELATIONS	THEORY
Object	 relations	 theory	 conceives	 of	 the
earliest	 relationships	 between	 the	 infant	 and	 its
caretakers	
as	
forming	
certain	
mental
representations	 and	 models	 of	 interaction	 that
tend	 to	 be	 repeated	 with	 other	 people.	 These
internalized	 object	 relations	 take	 the	 place	 of
biological	 instincts	 and	 are	 seen	 as	 somehow
having	a	motivating	power	of	their	own.	Whether
the	relatedness	is	thought	of	as	instinctually	based
or	 not,	 the	 focus	 is	 shifted	 from	 vicissitudes	 of
instincts	 to	 vicissitudes	 of	 relatedness.	 The	 most
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
905
extraordinary	 original	 proponent	 of	 a	 complete
object	 relations	 theory	 was	 Melanie	 Klein	 (see
KLEIN).
In	Freud’s	early	work,	a	part	object	is	that	part
of	the	mother,	such	as	the	breast,	where	there	is
immediate	 discharge	 of	 instinctual	 energy.	 Only
later	does	the	child	develop	the	capacity	to	attach
libido	to	the	whole	object.	In	Klein’s	theory,	either
part	or	whole	objects	can	be	internalized,	but	here
the	 notion	 of	 object	 is	 mixed	 with	 object
representation.	 There	 are	 many	 object	 relations
theories	developed	after	Klein	(see	Greenberg	and
Mitchell	 1983).	 Most	 popular	 among	 traditional
psychoanalysts	 today	 is	 the	 modified	 Kleinian
theory	of	Kernberg	(1976,	1980).
Freud	introduced	the	terms	“narcissistic	object
choice,”	 which	 is	 based	 on	 identification	 with	 an
object	 similar	 to	 one’s	 self,	 and	 “anaclitic	 object
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
906
choice,”	 which	 is	 based	 on	 passive	 dependent
needs.	 The	 narcissistic	 object	 choice	 is	 based
either	on	the	subject’s	self	(what	he	or	she	is,	was,
or	would	like	to	be),	or	on	someone	experienced
as	part	of	one’s	self	(see	NARCISSISM).
There	is	confusion	in	the	literature	about	the
notion	 of	 object	 constancy.	 This	 term	 was
introduced	by	Hartmann	in	1952	to	describe	the
constancy	 that	 a	 child	 achieves	 when	 the
relationship	to	its	love	object	remains	stable.	Prior
to	this,	the	object	is	simply	“need-satisfying.”	This
requires	 object	 permanence,	 in	 which	 a	 mental
representation	of	the	object	persists	in	the	object’s
absence,	a	cognitive	achievement	of	the	first	year
of	life.
The	confusion	arises	over	the	interchangeable
use	 of	 terms	 like	 libidinal	 object,	 libidinal	 object
constancy,	 and	 object	 constancy.	 The	 important
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
907
distinction	 to	 keep	 in	 mind	 is	 between	 object
permanence,	which	develops	early	in	life	and	is	a
cognitive	 achievement,	 and	 object	 constancy,
which	 probably	 develops	 during	 the	 end	 of	 the
second	 year	 of	 life	 and	 is	 a	 precursor	 of	 the
capacity	to	love	another	person	in	a	stable	fashion,
regardless	of	the	state	of	one’s	needs.
From	my	point	of	view,	the	important	aspect	of
object	constancy	is	this:	by	the	end	of	the	second
year	of	life	there	is	established	in	the	psyche	of	the
child	 a	 relatively	 benign	 object	 representation	 of
the	mother	that	serves	as	a	sense	of	security	for
the	 child.	 This	 has	 very	 important	 clinical
ramifications	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 preoedipally
disturbed	 patients.	 For	 example,	 Adler	 (1980)
claims	that	the	hallmark	of	the	borderline	patient’s
transference	 is	 the	 rapid	 disintegration	 of	 the
selfobject	 transference	 as	 soon	 as	 gratification	 is
not	 forthcoming;	 this	 is	 blamed	 on	 the	 problem
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
908
the	 borderline	 patient	 has	 with	 maintaining
mnemonic	 images.	 Adler	 and	 Buie	 (1979)	 argue
that	the	core	of	borderline	pathology	is	the	failure
to	develop	the	type	of	mental	representation	that
captures	 positive	 experiences	 with	 nurturant
caretakers.	
They	
call	
these	
representations
holding	or	soothing	introjects.	They	stress	the	loss
of	 evocative	 memory	 and	 distinguish	 evocative
memory	from	recognition	memory;	that	is	to	say,
under	 stress,	 borderline	 patients	 lose	 evocative
memory	capacity	for	previously	important	objects,
although	they	still	may	recognize	these	objects	if
confronted	with	them.	A	thorough	review	of	object
relations	 theories	 from	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 self
psychology	 is	 presented	 by	 Bacal	 and	 Newman
(1990).

OBSESSIONALISM
Freud	 (1909)	 wrote	 a	 classic	 paper	 on
obsessive-compulsive	 neuroses.	 He	 stressed	 the
magical	 thinking	 and	 personal	 superstitions	 in
these	 disorders,	 the	 omnipotence	 of	 thought	 (a
relic	 of	 the	 megalomania	 of	 infancy),	 obsessive
ideas	 (formations	 of	 long-standing	 representing
distortions,	uncertainty,	and	doubt)	that	draw	the
patient	 away	 from	 reality	 to	 abstract	 subjects,
ambivalence	
with	
much	
repressed	
sadism,
displacement	 of	 affect	 and	 of	 ideas,	 isolation—
both	 temporal	 and	 spatial—of	 the	 idea	 from	 the
affect	 and	 from	 the	 world	 to	 the	 isolated	 life	 of
abstractions,	and	regression,	wherein	preparatory
acts	become	the	substitute	for	final	decisions	and
thinking	 replaces	 acting.	 Thus	 an	 obsessive
thought,	 for	 Freud,	 is	 one	 whose	 function	 is	 to
represent	an	act	regressively.
OBSESSIONS,
OBSESSIONAL	NEUROSIS,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
911
In	 the	 obsessional	 neuroses	 the	 complex	 is
often	 retained	 in	 the	 consciousness	 but	 with	 a
dissociation	 of	 its	 affect.	 The	 starting	 point	 of	 a
neurosis	 may	 be	 mentioned	 by	 the	 patient	 in	 a
tone	 of	 complete	 indifference	 since	 he	 or	 she	 is
unaware	 of	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 material.	 The
two	 cardinal	 symptoms	 of	 obsessional	 neuroses
are	the	tendency	to	doubt	and	the	recurring	sense
of	compulsion.	A	deep	ambivalence	dominates	the
patient’s	 life—significant	 people	 in	 the	 patient’s
existence	 are	 both	 intensely	 loved	 and	 intensely
hated.	
In	
the	
obsessional	
neuroses,	
these
emotional	 attitudes	 are	 sharply	 separated.	 Freud
saw	the	doubting	as	a	result	of	this	ambivalence,
and	 the	 sense	 of	 compulsion	 as	 an	 attempt	 to
overcompensate	 for	 the	 doubt	 and	 uncertainty.
The	omnipotence	of	a	patient’s	thoughts,	the	belief
in	the	power	to	make	thoughts	come	true	in	some
magical	 way,	 was	 applied	 by	 Freud	 (1907)	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
912
various	primitive	beliefs	in	magic	and	to	religion.
Just	as	he	believed	infantile	sexuality	to	be	the	root
of	hysteria,	so	Freud	stressed	infantile	sexuality	as
leading	 to	 a	 nuclear	 complex	 in	 the	 obsessional
neuroses.	As	in	the	cases	of	hysteria,	he	believed
that	 the	 unraveling	 of	 these	 nuclear	 complexes
would	 automatically	 lead	 to	 a	 resolution	 of	 the
neuroses	(see	NEUROSIS).
Patients	 with	 obsessive-compulsive	 neuroses,
which	 we	 now	 know	 to	 be	 sometimes	 not	 far
psychologically	from	schizophrenia,	are	very	good
at	the	intellectual	game	of	interpreting	symbols.	I
have	 seen	 a	 number	 of	 patients	 recover	 from	 an
acute	 schizophrenic	 reaction	 only	 to	 develop	 a
serious	obsessive	neurosis	sometimes	complicated
by	
moderate	
depression.	
These	
depressed
obsessive	states	remain	stable	for	many	years	and
seem	to	protect	the	patient	from	another	outbreak
of	schizophrenia.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
913
The	 best	 phenomenological	 description	 of
patients	with	“obsessionalism”	has	been	presented
by	 Sullivan	 (1956).	 These	 patients	 are	 extremely
difficult	 to	 treat	 by	 the	 psychoanalytic	 method,
and	 Sullivan	 is	 very	 helpful	 in	 his	 down-to-earth
understanding	of	how	to	approach	them.	His	work
is	based	on	his	well-known	interpersonal	theory	of
psychiatry,	 in	 which	 the	 patient’s	 self-dynamism
(in	this	case,	obsessionalism)	functions	primarily
to	 avoid	 anxiety.	 Sullivan’s	 (1956)	 great	 clinical
insights	 into	 this	 condition	 are	 among	 the	 most
valuable	 sources	 for	 the	 understanding	 and
psychotherapeutic	treatment	of	obsessions.
Recently	 there	 have	 been	 claims	 that	 such
psychopharmacologic	
drugs	
as	
Prozac	
and
Anafranil	 reduce	 the	 intensity	 of	 obsessive-
compulsive	 symptoms.	 None	 of	 this	 refutes	 the
original	 concept,	 however,	 that	 the	 obsessional
neuroses	 are	 aptly	 called	 “guilt	 neuroses,”	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
914
Moore	and	Fine	(1990)	explain:	“The	superego	is
severely	turned	against	the	impulses,	affects,	and
ideas	 involved.	 These	 conflicts,	 along	 with	 ego
mechanisms	 of	 defence	 …	 result	 in	 compromise
formations	 manifested	 by	 the	 neuroses	 and
character	traits	described”	(p.	133).
There	is	no	better	clinical	example	than	that	of
our	 friend	 Samuel	 Johnson,	 a	 person	 with	 many
serious	
obsessive-compulsive	
symptoms.	
He
admitted	that	“the	great	business	of	his	life	was	to
escape	 from	 himself’	 (p.	 121),	 as	 his	 noted
biographer	 W.	 Jackson	 Bate	 (1977)	 reports	 and
then	explains,	“The	part	of	himself	from	which	he
needed	to	escape	was	the	remorseless	pressure	of
‘superego’	demand,	of	constant	self-criticism,	and
all	 the	 unconscious	 ruses	 of	 insistent	 self-
punishment”	(p.	121).
DSM-III-R	
(1987)	
downplays	
the	
term
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
915
“obsessive-compulsive	 neurosis”	 and	 substitutes
“obsessive	compulsive	disorder”	under	the	anxiety
disorders	 (p.	 245),	 and	 “obsessive	 compulsive
personality	disorder”	(p.	354).	The	study	of	these
disorders	is	in	much	ferment	today,	and	there	is
considerable	 unresolved	 controversy	 about	 the
etiology	and	treatment	of	the	conditions.

OCEANIC	FEELING
In	 his	 correspondence	 with	 Sigmund	 Freud
about	the	source	of	religious	sentiment	the	writer
Romain	 Rolland	 suggested	 as	 a	 religious	 source
the	 “oceanic	 feeling,”	 a	 wonderful	 sensation	 in
which	one	feels	essentially	fused	with	the	universe
in	a	kind	of	transcendental	sense	of	timelessness.
Rolland	was	trying	to	use	this	feeling	as	evidence
that	 there	 are	 more	 things	 in	 heaven	 and	 earth
than	are	dreamed	of	in	Freud’s	philosophy.	Freud
(1930)	 insisted	 this	 simply	 represented	
a
regression	to	an	early	state	of	infantile	narcissism
during	 which	 everything	 seems	 coextensive	 with
the	ego	of	the	infant.	Werman	(1986)	convincingly
argues	that	such	experiences	as	the	oceanic	feeling
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
917
in	 the	 adult	 cannot	 be	 simple	 replays	 of	 an
infantile	 experience	 but	 instead	 represent	 “a
complex	 phenomenon	 that	 derives	 from	 all
aspects	of	the	psyche,	including	the	subject’s	value
system	and	the	influences	of	his	culture”	(p.	123).
There	 are	 three	 categories	 of	 approaches	 to
religious	 experiences	 or	 mystical	 subjects.	 The
psychoanalytic	approach	attempts	to	explain	them
in	 terms	 of	 inner	 psychodynamics,	 using	 various
theoretical	 concepts.	 The	 philosophical	 approach
(e.g.,	Jaspers	1932)	views	religious	or	mystical	or
ecstatic	 experiences	 as	 “ciphers”	 that	 point	 to
transcendence	 as	 a	 possibility.	 Believers,	 such	 as
William	 James	 (1929),	 who	 have	 had	 such
experiences	 or	 followers	 of	 various	 religions	 are
convinced	 of	 their	 suprarational	 source.	 It	 is
interesting	 that	 the	 psychoanalytic	 orientation
requires	us	to	explain	the	choices	of	each	of	these
categories	 as	 representing	 in	 each	 person	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
918
compromise	 formation	 provided	 by	 the	 ego	 in
dealing	 with	 its	 “three	 harsh	 masters”	 (Freud
1933)—the	 id,	 the	 superego,	 and	 reality—or,
alternatively,	 having	 a	 role	 in	 maintaining	 the
cohesion	of	the	person’s	self.	The	reason	for	this
situation	 was	 given	 by	 the	 nonbeliever	 Bertrand
Russell,	when	asked	what	he	would	say	to	God	if
he	found	after	death	that	an	after-life	existed.	The
answer:	 “Lord,	 you	 did	 not	 give	 us	 sufficient
evidence.”	 Freud’s	 point	 was	 that	 the	 oceanic
feeling	and	other	mystical	or	ecstatic	experiences
are	 not	 sufficient	 evidence,	 except	 for	 those	 who
already	have	faith.

OEDIPUS	COMPLEX
This	term	represents	a	characteristic	group	of
largely	unconscious	ideas	and	feelings	universally
manifest	during	the	phallic	phase	(from	about	3	to
6	years	of	age)	that	remain	of	central	importance
throughout	 life.	 The	 drives,	 aims,	 fears,	 and
identifications	 are	 associated	 with	 the	 child’s
striving	for	a	sexual	union	with	the	parent	of	the
opposite	 sex	 and	 wishing	 for	 the	 death	 and
disappearance	of	the	parent	of	the	same	sex.	The
specifics	of	the	sexual	union	wish	vary	from	child
to	 child	 depending	 on	 the	 particular	 theory	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
920
sexual	union	that	pervades	the	child’s	mind	at	the
time.
The	 central	 importance	 of	 the	 Oedipus
complex	as	the	nucleus	of	all	psychoneuroses	was
stressed	 by	 Freud,	 who	 discovered	 it	 during	 his
self-analysis	 conducted	 after	 the	 death	 of	 his
father.	 He	 revealed	 this	 to	 his	 friend	 Fliess	 and
then	 first	 published	 some	 material	 from	 his	 self-
analysis	 in	 The	 Interpretation	 of	 Dreams	 (Freud
1900).	 The	 emphasis	 on	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 as
central	
to	
the	
psychoneuroses	
became	
a
fundamental	
shibboleth	
of	
orthodox
psychoanalysts	 at	 least	 through	 the	 1960s.	 With
the	 widening	 scope	 of	 psychoanalysis,	 the
importance	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 has	 been
increasingly	 debated,	 especially	 in	 the	 light	 of
knowledge	
gained	
through	
attempts	
to
psychoanalyze	 various	 personality	 disorders	 and
other	 disorders	 that	 are	 not	 included	 under
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
921
Freud’s	classical	psychoneuroses.
Kohut	 (1984)	 maintained	 that	 although	 there
was	an	oedipal	phase	of	development,	an	enduring
Oedipus	complex	did	not	occur	unless	the	patient
was	already	suffering	from	a	disorder	of	the	self.
The	 lust	 and	 aggression	 manifest	 in	 the	 Oedipus
complex,	 for	 Kohut,	 are	 already	 disintegration
products	 of	 a	 damaged	 sense	 of	 self,	 not	 a
universal	 phenomenon.	 This	 is	 an	 important
disagreement	 with	 the	 work	 of	 Freud,	 but	 it
should	be	pointed	out	that	Kohut’s	earlier	writings
deal	 predominantly	 with	 narcissistic	 disorders,
which	 Freud	 thought	 were	 not	 amenable	 to
psychoanalysis.	Later,	Kohut	(1984)	extended	his
self	 psychology	 to	 explain	 many	 other	 forms	 of
psychopathology	(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).
A	 nice	 review	 of	 varying	 conceptions	 of	 the
Oedipus	complex	is	to	be	found	in	Mullahy	(1948).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
922
He	 compares	 the	 writings	 of	 Freud,	 Adler,	 Jung,
Rank,	Horney,	Fromm,	Sullivan,	and	others	on	the
topic.	Every	psychoanalyst	in	the	early	years	of	the
discipline	gave	central	attention	to	the	role	of	the
Oedipus	 complex	 as	 they	 conceived	 of	 it	 in	 their
clinical	work.
Coexisting	 with	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 is	 an
entity	 called	 the	 negative	 Oedipus	 complex,	 in
which	 the	 child	 wishes	 to	 sexually	 possess	 the
parent	of	the	same	sex	and	destroy	the	parent	of
the	 opposite	 sex.	 It	 is	 assumed	 that	 if	 this	 holds
sway	 in	 the	 child’s	 personality,	 a	 homosexual
orientation	may	develop.	But	it	should	be	stressed
that	everyone	goes	through	a	combination	of	these
phases.
The	power	of	the	Oedipus	complex	lies	in	the
fear	 that	 it	 engenders.	 For	 the	 boy,	 the	 fear	 is
clearly	 that	 of	 castration;	 for	 the	 girl,	 it	 is	 a	 less
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
923
specific	 injury	 to	 the	 genitals	 (see	 FEMALE
PSYCHOLOGY).	But	these	fears	are	later	versions
of	the	child’s	most	infantile	fears	of	loss	of	the	love
of	a	parent	or	loss	of	the	parent	itself.
Resolution	of	the	Oedipus	complex	takes	place
by	identification	with	the	parent	of	the	same	sex
and	 a	 partial	 renunciation	 of	 the	 parent	 of	 the
opposite	 sex,	 with	 the	 later	 rediscovery	 of	 the
imago	of	that	parent	in	the	earliest	love	objects	of
adolescence	and	adult	life.	The	Oedipus	complex	is
very	 important	 because	 the	 resolution	 of	 it
establishes	the	superego	through	an	identification
with	 the	 values	 and	 commands	 of	 the	 chosen
parent.	 Lacan	 extends	 this	 even	 further	 in	 using
the	 term	 “oedipization”	 to	 denote	 a	 process	 in
which	 the	 child	 enters	 the	 symbolic	 order	 of
speech	 through	 identification	 with	 the	 parent	 of
the	same	sex,	and	in	so	doing	becomes	a	member
of	the	cultural	milieu	(see	LACAN).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
924
Some	 authors	 use	 the	 term	 oedipal	 phase	 as
synonymous	
with	
the	
phallic	
phase	
of
development,	while	others	reserve	it	for	the	end	of
the	 phallic	 phase	 when	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 is
well	formed.	It	is	thought	that	in	the	early	part	of
the	phallic	phase	narcissism	predominates,	and	in
the	latter	part	the	first	manifestations	of	what	will
become	adult	or	mature	object	love	appear.
Klein,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 argued	 that	 the
Oedipus	complex	arises	before	the	genital	phase,
and	 that	 Oedipal	 manifestations	 are	 always
present,	 even	 during	 the	 first	 year	 of	 life	 (sec
KLEIN).	 Moreover,	 she	 maintained,	 when	 the
depressive	position	is	not	worked	through,	there
is	a	reprojection	of	the	sadistic	superego	in	order
to	 deflect	 intolerable	 guilt	 outside,	 which	 in	 turn
requires	 a	 regression	 to	 the	 paranoid-schizoid
position.	 This,	 however,	 reinforces	 persecutory
anxiety	 and	 leads	 to	 the	 greedy	 absorption	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
925
supplies	 as	 a	 protection	 against	 the	 dangers	 of
threatening	 external	 attack.	 All	 of	 this	 may	 be
prematurely	 sexualized	 as	 an	 attempt	 to	 deny
pregenital	sadism	through	genital	love.
The	 longing	 for	 the	 “good	 breast”	 out	 of
displaced	oral	dependency	may	be	experienced	as
the	 longing	 for	 the	 father’s	 penis	 and	 lead	 to
homosexuality	 in	 males	 and	 hysteria	 in	 females.
The	“bad	breast”	out	of	displaced	aggression	may
be	experienced	as	the	fear	of	the	destructive	penis.
Similarly,	the	primal	scene	receives	the	projection
of	 oral	 sadism	 characterized	 by	 the	 devouring
phallic	mother	with	the	“vagina	dentata”	and	the
sadistic	father.	Due	to	this	projection,	an	imagined
sadistic	 father	 interferes	 with	 normal	 oedipal
identification	 in	 males,	 while	 the	 imagined
devouring	 phallic	 mother	 interferes	 with	 normal
oedipal	 identification	 in	 females.	 According	 to
Klein,	penis	envy	is	derived	from	oral	envy	and	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
926
therefore	not	a	critical	feature	of	female	sexuality
(see	 PENIS	 ENVY).	 Conversely,	 sexual	 inhibition
arises	from	defenses	against	sadistic	impulses	that
are	infiltrating	sexual	urges.	Klein	conceptualized
oral	drives	and	conflicts	as	fueling	and	infiltrating
oedipal	developments	everywhere.
The	 early	 fantasy	 life	 of	 the	 pregenital	 child
contains	 many	 indications	 of	 incipient	 oedipal
tendencies	 with	 marked	 aggression	 and	 sadism
attached	 to	 them.	 Work	 with	 borderline	 patients
often	 reveals	 enormously	 sadistically	 charged
oedipal	 relationships.	 It	 is	 often	 very	 difficult	 to
decide	whether	a	borderline	patient	has	retreated
from	 a	 nuclear	 Oedipus	 complex	 to	 pregenital
sadistic	drives,	or	whether	the	Oedipus	complex	in
the	 patient	 is	 loaded	 with	 unresolved	 pregenital
sadistic	elements.
Kohut	 (1982)	 correctly	 pointed	 out	 that	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
927
story	 of	 Oedipus	 Rex,	 from	 which	 Freud	 took	 the
concept	 of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex,	 does	 not	 begin
with	 the	 slaying	 by	 Oedipus	 of	 his	 father	 and
subsequent	marriage	to	his	mother,	but	with	the
earlier	action	by	Oedipus’s	father	in	which	he	puts
the	child	out	to	die	in	spite	of	the	lamentations	of
the	 mother.	 In	 this	 play	 we	 see	 how	 a	 massive
failure	 in	 early	 pregenital	 parenting	 rebounds
during	the	oedipal	period	in	highly	sadistic	oedipal
fantasies	 and	 behavior.	 Even	 the	 classical	 cases
studied	 by	 Breuer	 and	 Freud	 (1893-1895)	 show
many	elements	of	serious	pregenital	damage,	and
some	 authors	 (Reichard	 1956)	 have	 maintained
that	at	least	some	of	their	cases	of	hysteria	were
actually	borderline	or	schizophrenic	patients.
The	
psychotherapist	
who	
neglects	
the
importance	of	the	patient’s	Oedipus	complex	does
so	
at	
the	
serious	
peril	
of	
a	
successful
psychoanalytic	 therapy.	 A	 number	 of	 theoretical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
928
psychotherapy	orientations	have	evolved	that	can
be	used	in	a	collusion	between	the	therapist	and
the	patient	to	avoid	facing	the	powerful	emotions
that	center	on	the	Oedipus	complex.	The	presence
of	these	powerful	emotions,	and	their	concomitant
guilt	and	fear	of	retaliation,	is	one	of	Freud’s	most
important	discoveries	and	is	rediscovered	in	one’s
clinical	practice	over	and	over	again	with	patients
of	every	age	group.	The	question	of	the	centrality
of	 the	 Oedipus	 complex	 in	 the	 various	 disorders
treated	 in	 outpatient	 psychoanalytic	 therapy
remains	 one	 of	 the	 most	 debated	 topics	 in	 the
literature	 today.	 In	 my	 opinion,	 it	 should	 be
assumed	 as	 significant	 in	 every	 case	 until
overwhelming	 clinical	 evidence	 is	 produced	 that
contradicts	this	assumption.

ONTOLOGICAL	INSECURITY
(see	also	SCHIZOID)
Laing	 (1969)	 borrowed	 the	 term	 ontological
insecurity	 from	 the	 theologian	 Paul	 Tillich,	 for
whom	it	was	the	universal	human	condition.	For
Laing,	it	is	the	special	problem	of	the	schizoid.	In
the	state	of	ontological	insecurity	there	is	no	sense
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
930
of	continuity	and	no	cohesion	of	the	self	in	time,	as
illustrated	in	the	literary	works	of	Samuel	Beckett.
The	 problem	 the	 schizoid	 patient	 has	 is	 to
preserve	 the	 self,	 as	 compared	 to	 neurotics	 and
normal	individuals,	who	wish	to	gratify	the	self.
The	cause	of	ontological	insecurity	is	the	lack
of	 mirroring	 of	 the	 true	 self,	 according	 to	 Laing,
the	absence	of	the	smiling	notice	and	appreciation
of	 the	 patient’s	 self	 as	 a	 child.	 He	 (1969)	 writes
that	the	development	of	a	self	requires	“the	loving
eye	 of	 the	 mother”	 (p.	 125).	 This	 is	 required	 for
ontological	 autonomy,	 Laing	 says.	 Such	 patients,
however,	do	not	suffer	from	unconscious	conflicts.
Their	problem	is	“beyond	the	pleasure	principle.”
Gratification	 is	 not	 the	 issue	 for	 patients	 with
ontological	insecurity.
There	are	three	forms	of	anxiety	that	manifest
themselves	 in	 ontological	 insecurity.	 The	 first	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
931
these	is	anxiety	of	engulfment,	the	fears	of	being
overwhelmed	 and	 of	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 self	 in	 a
merger	 with	 the	 other.	 This	 is	 prevented	 by
isolation	 from	 people	 and	 a	 deliberate	 effort	 to
confuse	 others	 and	 to	 be	 misunderstood.	 The
second	 is	 labeled	 anxiety	 of	 implosion.	 This	 is	 a
sense	of	persecution	from	reality,	a	fear	that	it	will
crash	 in	 and	 obliterate	 the	 person,	 who	 already
feels	 empty.	 A	 third	 form	 of	 anxiety	 and
ontological	 insecurity	 is	 of	 petrifaction.	 This
represents	becoming	a	thing	or	a	robot.	To	defend
against	
petrifaction	
the	
patient	
uses
depersonalization;	 that	 is,	 he	 or	 she	 stops
responding	when	the	other	individual	is	tiresome
or	 disturbing.	 This	 destroys	 the	 other	 person’s
subjectivity.	It	“petrifies	the	other,”	but	it	leads	to
more	
ontological	
insecurity,	
since	
one’s
ontological	 security	 depends	 on	 an	 enlivened
reaction	 from	 the	 other.	 Thus	 a	 vicious	 circle
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
932
becomes	activated.
In	
patients	
with	
ontological	
insecurity,
dependency	 on	 the	 other	 is	 substituted	 for
genuine	mutuality.	The	schizoid	patient	oscillates
between	 merger	 and	 isolation,	 not,	 as	 in	 the
normal	
person,	
between	
relatedness	
and
separation.	The	patient	splits	into	a	secret	true	self
and	 a	 body	 associated	 with	 a	 false	 self.	 All	 of	 us
reversibly	do	this	under	stress,	for	example,	at	a
boring	 party,	 under	 torture,	 during	 a	 painful	 or
embarrassing	 medical	 examination,	 or	 during
painful	dental	work;	but	in	the	schizoid	individual,
a	definitive	split	occurs	between	the	true	self	and	a
false	 self	 system,	 in	 which	 the	 false	 self	 system
becomes	the	manifest	personality.	This	definitive
split	 becomes	 a	 basic	 and	 irreversible	 schizoid
style.	 The	 patient,	 in	 a	 common	 clinical	 picture,
tries	 to	 do	 everything	 for	 himself	 or	 herself	 in
isolation.	The	advantage	of	this	is	that	it	protects
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
933
the	 patient	 from	 ontological	 insecurity	 and	 the
anxieties	 described	 above	 as	 associated	 with
ontological	insecurity.
It	 should	 be	 pointed	 out	 that	 the	 term
ontological	insecurity	is	a	dreadful	misnomer	and	a
mixture	 of	 levels	 of	 discourse	 between	 the
metaphysical	 and	 the	 clinical.	 This	 does	 not
detract	 from	 the	 fact	 that	 Laing’s	 (1969)
description	 of	 the	 development	 of	 the	 schizoid
style	is	one	of	the	best	in	the	literature.

OPTIMAL	FRUSTRATION,
OPTIMAL	RESPONSIVENESS
Kohut’s	
conceptual	
shift	
from	
viewing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
934
transmuting	 internalizations,	 based	 on	 dynamics
and	 energetics	 in	 Freud’s	 metapsychology,	 as
curative	 in	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 to	 viewing
empathy	 as	 curative	 represents	 a	 change	 from	 a
focus	on	mechanisms	to	a	focus	on	the	experiential
and	 the	 transactional	 in	 the	 treatment.	 Terman
(1989)	 points	 out	 that	 self	 psychologists	 can	 be
classified	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 this	 shift.	 The
explanatory-interpretive	 group	 claims	 that	 the
curative	process	in	psychoanalytic	therapy	occurs
when	a	self	psychologist	recognizes	and	interprets
the	vicissitudes	of	the	selfobject	transference.	This
transference	undergoes	its	vicissitudes	because	of
the	inevitable	provision	of	optimal	frustration	by
the	therapist.	The	assumption	is	that	change	will
occur	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 interpretation	 of	 these
transference	
vicissitudes	
alone.	
The	
crucial
function	 of	 the	 analyst	 is	 to	 articulate	 archaic
affect	states	for	the	patient.	Terman	explains,	“The
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
935
weight	 of	 emphasis,	 then,	 is	 on	 the	 explanatory-
interpretive	aspects	of	the	therapeutic	process—
not	 as	 they	 facilitate	 a	 different	 experience	 in	 a
relationship	nor	as	they	permit	internalization	of
functions,	 but	 as	 they	 foster	 intercognitive
transformations”	(p.	92).
Terman	 calls	 the	 other	 self	 psychologists	 the
relationship	 or	 experiential	 group,	 in	 which	 he
includes	himself.	This	group	believes	that	a	happy
archaic	 transference	 enables	 development	 to
resume.	It	emphasizes	optimal	responsiveness,	not
optimal	frustration,	as	crucial.	The	experience	of	a
new	relationship	becomes	central	to	the	patient’s
resumption	 of	 development.	 So	 even	 among	 self
psychologists,	 the	 same	 polarization	 occurs	 as
among	 “traditional”	 psychoanalysts,	 between
those	who	emphasize	cognition	and	articulation	as
crucial	factors	in	altering	the	ego	and	those	who
emphasize	
experience,	
relationship,	
and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
936
interaction.	 One	 of	 the	 disadvantages	 of	 self
psychology	 is	 that	 neither	 group	 presents	 a	 very
convincing	specific	metapsychological	formulation
of	 how	 the	 self	 is	 altered	 either	 by	 optimal
frustration	with	transmuting	internalization	or	by
optimal	
responsiveness	
and	
empathy.	
This
refinement	 remains	 for	 the	 future	 (see	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).

OVERDETERMINATION
Any	 symptom,	 dream,	 fantasy,	 or	 behavioral
item	is	always	overdetermined.	That	means	it	has
more	than	one	meaning	and	expresses	drives	and
conflicts	 derived	 from	 more	 than	 one	 level	 or
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
937
aspect	of	the	personality.	It	provides	a	solution	to
a	number	of	problems	and	expresses	a	number	of
convergent	
tendencies	
(see	
MULTIPLE
FUNCTION).	 All	 these	 things	 are	 overdetermined
in	 the	 sense	 that	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 interpret	 all	 of
them	 as	 the	 result	 of	 compromises	 formed	 at
various	 levels	 of	 psychological	 development.	 It
remains	 necessary,	 then,	 for	 the	 therapist	 to
decide	 what	 is	 the	 central	 focus	 of	 the	 material
and	 what	 is	 the	 theme	 going	 through	 the
particular	set	of	free	associations	in	that	particular
session	(Saul	1958).	This	is	a	clinical	judgment	and
depends	 on	 the	 sense	 of	 continuity	 between	 the
present	
session	
and	
previous	
sessions.
Interpretations	 are	 optimally	 aimed	 at	 whatever
level	 is	 central	 to	 the	 patient’s	 focus	 at	 the	 time
they	are	made.
It	does	not	follow	from	this	that	any	dream	or
symptom	 may	 be	 interpreted	 in	 an	 infinite
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
938
number	of	ways,	but	rather	that	a	certain	limited
set	 of	 various	 possible	 interpretations	 are
permitted.	 Ambiguity	 is	 dispelled	 by	 the	 context,
verbal	 intonation,	 material	 of	 previous	 sessions,
and	 nonverbal	 expressions.	 This	 implies	 that	 in
good	 psychoanalytic	 practice	 it	 is	 sometimes
possible	 to	 come	 back	 to	 an	 important	 dream
months	 later	 and	 reinterpret	 the	 dream	 in	 a
different	 way.	 This	 would	 not	 mean	 that	 the
original	interpretation	was	wrong,	but	that	it	was
simply	 at	 a	 different	 level	 not	 as	 deep	 as	 the
current	 one.	 The	 achievement	 of	 depth	 in	 a
patient’s	 material	 over	 time	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most
important	 signs	 of	 whether	 a	 psychoanalytic
treatment	is	truly	psychoanalytic;	if	an	increasing
depth	 and	 primitivity	 of	 the	 material	 does	 not
appear,	the	treatment	should	be	reevaluated	and
consultation	should	be	requested.

PANIC	DISORDER
Panic	 disorder,	 unlike	 generalized	 anxiety
disorder,	 comes	 on	 suddenly,	 is	 very	 acute	 in	 its
symptomatology,	 and	 exhibits	 relative	 calm
between	episodes.	Panic	attacks	are	characterized
by	hyperventilation,	a	fear	of	going	crazy,	a	sense
of	 intense	 terror	 and	 impending	 doom,	 and	 a
conviction	 that	 one	 is	 about	 to	 die	 from	 some
organic	catastrophe,	such	as	a	heart	attack.	These
attacks	may	last	several	minutes	or	more	than	an
hour.	DSM-III-R	(1987)	differentiates	among	panic
disorder	 with	 concomitant	 agoraphobia,	 panic
disorder	 without	 agoraphobia,	 and	 agoraphobia
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
941
without	panic	disorder.
Panic	 attacks	 have	 been	 under	 intensive
biochemical	investigation.	There	are	claims	in	the
literature	 that	 such	 drugs	 as	 Xanax	 (alprazolam)
are	 effective	 in	 preventing	 their	 onset.	 Other
authors	
suggest	
the	
use	
of	
tricyclic
antidepressants,	
often	
in	
combination	
with
benzodiazepines.	 From	 the	 psychodynamic	 point
of	 view,	 the	 panic	 disorder	 is	 a	 form	 of	 anxiety
disorder	(see	ANXIETY).
The	 proper	 approach	 to	 panic	 disorder,	 it
seems	
to	
me,	
would	
be	
first	
supportive
psychotherapy	
with	
the	
use	
of
psychopharmacologic	 agents.	 A	 current	 textbook
of	 psychopharmacology	 should	 be	 consulted	 for
details,	 but	 only	 a	 person	 properly	 qualified	 and
experienced	 in	 the	 use	 of	 these	 agents	 should
administer	 them.	 If	 there	 is	 no	 response	 to	 this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
942
form	of	treatment,	or	if	the	patient	desires	more
than	 palliative	 measures,	 psychoanalysis	 should
be	 considered.	 Vanggaard	 (1989)	 reports	 details
of	a	case	of	panic	disorder	treated	successfully	by
psychoanalysis,	 although	 his	 technique	 is	 rather
unorthodox.

PARAMETER
Eissler	 (1953)	 used	 the	 term	 “parameter”	 to
mean	 any	 intervention	 in	 psychoanalysis	 other
than	interpretation.	This	assumes	that	in	classical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
943
psychoanalysis	 interpretation	 is	 the	 exclusive
technical	 tool.	 A	 parameter	 is	 introduced	 only	 if
the	treatment	process	would	otherwise	come	to	a
standstill;	 furthermore,	 the	 parameter	 must	 be
dispensable	and	analyzable.	The	interpretation	of
the	meaning	of	the	parameter	to	the	patient	is	very
important	 in	 this	 extremely	 strict	 theoretical
position.
In	actual	practice	there	are	many	parameters
introduced	and	they	cannot	be	avoided.	The	very
physicianly	
vocation	
(see	
PHYSICIANLY
VOCATION)	of	the	psychotherapist	requires	them,
and	 they	 prepare	 the	 patient	 to	 be	 receptive	 to
properly	timed	interpretations.	Unfortunately,	the
term	“parameter”	has	a	pejorative	implication	for
any	interventions	other	than	interpretations	that
the	analyst	may	make.	An	interaction	with	another
person	 that	 consisted	 solely	 of	 interpretation,
however,	 would	 be	 intolerable	 to	 all	 but
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
944
masochists.
Probably	the	most	extreme	view	is	found	in	the
work	of	Langs	(1979,	1982).	The	issue	is	whether
interventions	 other	 than	 interpretations	 do
irreparable	 damage	 to	 the	 analytic	 process,	 or
whether,	since	they	are	unavoidable,	they	may	be
permitted	 as	 part	 of	 establishing	 a	 reasonable
ambience	in	the	therapeutic	situation.	The	danger
of	 an	 extremely	 arid	 relationship	 characterized
only	 by	 interpretations	 is	 that	 of	 an	 iatrogenic
narcissistic	regression	on	the	part	of	the	patient.
Self	 psychologists	 have	 made	 much	 of	 this	 issue
and	 would	 consider	 an	 attempt	 to	 restrict	 the
relationship	 solely	 to	 interpretations	 as	 a	 gross
failure	 of	 empathy	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 therapist.
Langs,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 would	 consider	 any
interventions	
other	
than	
interpretation	
as
examples	 of	 acting	 out,	 projective	 identification,
and	psychopathology	on	the	part	of	the	therapist,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
945
which	the	patient	would	then	proceed	to	attempt
to	 cure.	 There	 are	 some	 unusual	 implications
about	 the	 patient’s	 unconscious	 in	 Langs’	 views
(see	Chessick	1982).

PARANOIA,
PARANOID
Paranoia	has	been	known	to	the	western	world
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
946
from	the	earliest	Greek	literature,	although	it	has
never	 been	 clearly	 or	 consistently	 defined.	 A
sensible	 use	 of	 the	 term	 appears	 in	 DSM-III-R
(1987).	
Delusional	
paranoid	
disorder	
is
characterized	 by	 delusions	 “involving	 situations
that	 occur	 in	 real	 life,	 such	 as	 being	 followed,
poisoned,	 infected,	 loved	 at	 a	 distance,	 having	 a
disease,	being	deceived	by	one’s	spouse	or	lover”
(p.	202).	This	has	to	last	at	least	one	month;	apart
from	the	delusions	there	is	no	grossly	bizarre	or
flagrantly	 psychotic	 behavior.	 Depending	 on	 the
kind	
of	
delusional	
material,	
DSM-III-R
distinguishes	
erotomanic,	
grandiose,	
jealous,
persecutory,	 somatic,	 and	 unspecified	 types	 of
delusional	 paranoid	 disorders.	 The	 essential
abnormality	is	usually	a	persecutory	or	grandiose
set	of	delusions.
The	 older	 literature	 conceived	 of	 paranoia	 as
an	 encapsulated	 condition	 in	 which	 a	 very
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
947
complex	and	intricate	delusional	system	develops
outside	 the	 patient’s	 everyday	 life	 and	 is	 often
kept	 secret	 from	 those	 around	 the	 patient.
Paranoid	 delusional	 disorder	 and	 paranoia	 differ
from	paranoid	schizophrenic	disorders	in	that	in
the	 former	 the	 delusions	 are	 usually	 organized
into	 a	 coherent,	 internally	 consistent	 system.	 All
too	 often	 the	 patient	 may	 be	 prepared	 to	 act	 on
that	 system,	 which	 may	 lead	 to	 very	 serious
consequences	for	the	patient	and	others.	Paranoid
individuals	are	often	extremely	dangerous	and	are
very	
difficult	
to	
work	
with	
in	
intensive
psychotherapy.
Here	is	a	case	of	delusional	paranoid	disorder.
A	 middle-aged	 philosophy	 professor	 came	 to	 see
me	after	what	appeared	at	first	to	be	a	standard
mid-life	 crisis:	 his	 children	 were	 grown	 and
married,	and	his	wife	was	getting	tired	of	the	role
of	 housewife	 and	 nurturant	 supporter.	 She	 was
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
948
beginning	to	indicate	that	she	wished	to	have	a	life
and	career	and	self	of	her	own,	thus	disrupting	a
rather	 long-standing	 arrangement	 and	 cozy
empathic	support	matrix	for	my	patient.
My	patient	had	noticed	about	six	months	prior
to	 treatment	 the	 onset	 of	 peculiar	 sensations,
suggesting	 an	 inner	 change	 in	 him	 that	 he	 had
difficulty	 explaining.	 These	 feelings	 especially
occurred	when	he	was	in	a	small	office	with	two	or
three	 of	 his	 male	 colleagues	 working	 closely
together	on	some	philosophical	project.
After	 a	 while	 it	 seemed	 to	 him	 that	 these
changes,	 which	 had	 led	 to	 a	 puzzling	 sense	 of
estrangement	 of	 various	 parts	 of	 his	 body,	 did
indeed	 have	 an	 identifiable	 source.	 He	 felt	 that
their	 origin	 was	 from	 certain	 electric	 currents
emanating	 from	 a	 specific	 focus	 in	 his	 body,	 a
focus	that	he	gradually	recognized	to	be	his	right
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
949
testicle.
As	 these	 sensations	 continued,	 he	 became
convinced	this	focus	in	his	testicle	was	not	really	a
part	of	himself	but	was	a	source	within	him	that
was	not	actually	him,	a	source	that	he	eventually
identified	 as	 some	 kind	 of	 radioactive	 material
that	 had	 been	 placed	 there	 in	 some	 mysterious
fashion,	perhaps	while	he	slept.
The	feeling	of	inner	change	began	to	continue
even	 at	 night.	 As	 he	 would	 fall	 asleep,	 he	 would
begin	to	see	images	in	which	the	world	took	on	a
kind	 of	 distorted	 appearance;	 vague	 shadows
would	flit	across	his	visual	field.	He	became	aware
that	
the	
source	
of	
radiation	
was	
not
autochthonous	 but	 he	 was	 the	 receptor	 of
messages	 sent	 from	 outside	 himself.	 At	 first,	 he
thought	that	these	messages	were	transmitted	to
the	focus	in	his	testicle	through	some	sort	of	gas,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
950
electron	beams,	X	rays,	or	cosmic	radiation	of	an
unidentified	source.
Eventually,	as	he	reflected	on	the	experiences,
it	 became	 clear	 to	 him	 that	 this	 unidentified
external	source	that	exerted	such	influence	on	him
was	 not	 friendly.	 It	 was	 also	 apparently	 making
changes	 in	 his	 wife	 and	 children	 without	 their
knowledge.	 This	 unidentified	 source	 was	 both
revealing	itself	to	him	but	also	concealing	itself,	in
that	it	was	vague	and	mysterious;	to	his	wife	and
children	 it	 was	 completely	 concealed,	 so	 that	 he
was	in	the	privileged	position	of	having	stumbled
into	a	clearing	in	which	he	could	get	a	glimpse	of	a
cosmic	process	that	seemed	more	and	more	to	him
to	 pervade	 the	 entire	 being	 of	 himself	 and	 his
family.
Gradually	 a	 certain	 clarification	 took	 place
regarding	 the	 nature	 of	 this	 cosmic	 process.	 He
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
951
realized	that	everything	being	done	to	him,	even
his	 very	 existence	 and	 life	 experiences,	 was
transmitted	
and	
regulated	
by	
this	
unseen
influencing	 apparatus,	 a	 machine	 of	 obscure
construction	 containing	 large	 and	 unimaginable
parts,	far	beyond	the	grasp	of	any	normal	mortal
to	understand.	As	time	passed,	it	became	apparent
that	 this	 remarkable	 machine	 served	 as	 the
ground	of	the	being	of	all	the	entities	with	which
the	 patient	 had	 to	 interact,	 and	 determined	 the
very	mode	of	their	existence	and	the	way	in	which
they	 experienced	 the	 world	 and	 communicated
these	experiences	to	him.
His	 final	 revelation	 came	 when	 in	 a	 lightning
flash	 he	 realized	 that	 behind	 this	 enormous
machine	was	a	group	of	unidentifiable	enemies,	all
men,	perhaps	male	demons,	who	were	operating
the	 machine.	 The	 impression	 grew	 stronger	 and
stronger	that	these	male	demons	bore	a	suspicious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
952
resemblance	to	the	very	men	that	he	was	working
with	in	his	university	office.	In	a	way,	these	male
colleagues	seemed	to	him	to	have	been	created	in
the	image	of	the	male	demons.
The	details	of	my	patient’s	influencing	machine
have	been	described	before	(Tausk	1933).	Since	it
was	 capable	 of	 producing	 the	 world	 of	 visual
reality	 for	 the	 patient,	 everything	 he	 saw	 was
generated	by	the	machine.	It	could	produce	as	well
as	remove	moods,	thoughts,	and	feelings	by	means
of	 waves	 or	 rays	 or	 mysterious	 forces	 that	 the
sophisticated	philosopher,	with	all	his	knowledge
of	 modern	 physics,	 was	 unable	 to	 explain.	 It
produced	 all	 the	 motor	 phenomena	 of	 his	 body,
including	 erections	 and	 other	 body	 movements,
through	 the	 use	 of	 air	 currents,	 electricity,
magnetism,	 or	 X	 rays.	 It	 was	 responsible	 for	 all
physical	occurrences	in	the	patient’s	body,	such	as
skin	 eruptions	 and	 abscesses.	 The	 machine	 also
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
953
created	
indescribable	
sensations,	
sometimes
ecstatic,	 that	 were	 even	 strange	 to	 the	 patient
himself	 and	 that	 he	 had	 never	 felt	 before.	 A
constant	 concern	 of	 the	 patient	 was	 that,	 as	 his
therapist,	 I	 too	 was	 under	 the	 influence	 of	 the
apparatus,	although	it	was	not	clear	whether	I	was
allied	 with	 the	 conspiracy	 of	 demonic	 enemies
who	 were	 driving	 this	 apparatus	 or	 was	 simply
another	victim	of	it,	like	the	patient	and	his	family.
Obsessed	with	his	discovery,	the	patient	reminded
me	 that	 Nietzsche	 was	 right	 when	 he	 wrote,	 “A
philosopher	 is	 a	 man	 who	 never	 ceases	 to
experience,	 see,	 hear,	 suspect,	 hope,	 and	 dream
extraordinary	things.	…	Philosophy	is	a	voluntary
living	amid	ice	and	mountain	heights.”
The	 great	 psychoanalyst	 and	 pediatrician
Donald	 Winnicott	 (1968)	 postulated	 that	 good-
enough	 holding	 facilitates	 the	 formation	 of	 a
psychosomatic	partnership	in	the	infant:
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
954
This	 contributes	 to	 the	 sense	 of	 “real”	 as
opposed	
to	
“unreal.”	
Faulty	
handling
militates	against	the	development	of	muscle
tone,	and	that	which	is	called	“coordination,”
and	 against	 the	 capacity	 of	 the	 infant	 to
enjoy	 the	 experience	 of	 body	 functioning,
and	of	Being.	[p.	19]
If	 the	 environment	 behaves	 well,	 the	 infant
has	 a	 chance	 to	 maintain	 a	 sense	 of
continuity	 of	 being;	 perhaps	 this	 may	 go
right	back	to	the	first	stirrings	in	the	womb.
When	this	exists	the	individual	has	a	stability
that	can	be	gained	in	no	other	way.	[p.	28]
Searles	(1960)	claims	that
there	is	within	the	human	individual	a	sense,
whether	at	a	conscious	or	unconscious	level,
of	relatedness	to	his	nonhuman	environment,
that	
this	
relatedness	
is	
one	
of	
the
transcendentally	 important	 facts	 of	 human
living,	 that—as	 with	 other	 very	 important
circumstances	 in	 human	 existence—	 it	 is	 a
source	 of	 ambivalent	 feelings	 to	 him,	 and
that,	 finally,	 if	 he	 tries	 to	 ignore	 its
importance	to	himself,	he	does	so	at	peril	to
his	psychological	well-being,	[p.	6]
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
955
Searles	 argues	 that	 a	 chronic	 inability	 during
infancy	and	early	childhood	to	relate	oneself	to	a
relatively	stable,	relatively	realistically	perceived,
relatively	simple	world	of	inanimate	objects	may
have	much	to	do	with	one’s	inability	in	adult	life	to
find	 fundamental,	 graspable	 realities	 and	 a
tangible	 meaning	 in	 life.	 Conversely,	 a	 mature
relatedness	 with	 the	 nonhuman	 environment	 is
very	 fruitful	 in	 the	 assuagement	 of	 anxiety,	 the
fostering	 of	 self-realization,	 the	 deepening	 of
feeling	of	one’s	reality,	and	the	fostering	of	one’s
appreciation	and	acceptance	of	others.
Searles	quotes	Fromm	and	Tillich	in	describing
the	repercussions	in	various	areas	of	human	living
that	result	from	disjointedness	in	the	individual’s
relationship	with	his	nonhuman	environment.	He
describes	 the	 most	 important	 result	 of	 this
disjointedness	as	causing	the	person	to	deal	with
his	 or	 her	 fellow	 humans	 in	 a	 noncherishing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
956
manner.	
Human	
relations	
and	
material
possessions	 are	 experienced	 in	 ways	 that	 are
similarly	
impoverished	
of	
a	
sense	
of
meaningfulness.
Freud	
(1914)	
argued	
that	
metaphysical
speculation	was	based	on	self-observation,	which
he	also	regarded	as	the	basis	of	the	self-criticism
of	conscience.	He	called	self-observation	a	kind	of
“internal	 research,	 which	 furnishes	 philosophy
with	the	material	for	its	intellectual	operations”	(p.
96).	In	paranoid	patients	this	self-critical	function
becomes	
projected,	
says	
Freud,	
and	
their
delusions	 of	 being	 watched	 and	 criticized	 by
external	 “voices”	 has	 the	 same	 psychodynamic
root	as	their	“characteristic	tendency	to	construct
speculative	 systems”	 (p.	 96).	 He	 views	 the
“heightening”	 of	 the	 activity	 of	 this	 critically
observing	agency	as	the	basis	of	both	conscience
and	philosophic	introspection.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
957
A	voluminous	literature	has	developed	around
Freud’s	(1911)	interpretation	of	the	Schreber	case.
Freud	believed	that	homosexuality	is	at	the	basis
of	 paranoid	 thinking.	 Defensive	 denial,	 reaction
formation,	 and	 projection	 yield	 a	 formulation	 in
which	the	unconscious	loving	wish	for	the	man	is
denied	 (“I	 do	 not	 love	 him,	 I	 hate	 him”)	 and
returns	 to	 consciousness	 as	 a	 projected	 hatred
coming	 from	 the	 individual	 the	 patient	 secretly
loves.	This	gives	rise	to	what	is	sometimes	called
paranoid	 anxiety,	 in	 which	 the	 terrified	 patient
anticipates	 an	 attack	 by	 the	 individual	 on	 whom
the	 projection	 has	 been	 made	 and	 may	 even	 kill
that	 person	 in	 an	 attempt	 to	 prevent	 the	 attack.
Whether	it	is	possible,	as	Freud	did,	to	postulate
homosexuality	 at	 the	 basis	 of	 every	 paranoid
delusion	 remains	 undecided	 and	 much	 debated.
Even	 traditional	 psychoanalysts	 are	 divided
between	 those	 who	 believe	 that	 there	 is	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
958
homosexual	element	in	every	case	of	paranoia	and
those	who	do	not	follow	Freud	on	this	matter.
It	 is	 possible	 that	 a	 confusion	 between
homosexuality	 and	 pseudohomosexuality	 has	 led
to	
this	
controversy	
(see
PSEUDOHOMOSEXUALITY).	
Ovesey	
(1969)
attempted	 to	 reinterpret	 Freud’s	 theory	 by
claiming	that	anxiety	about	homosexuality	has	at
least	 three	 motivational	 components.	 The	 first
component	 is	 the	 sexual.	 The	 true	 homosexual
seeks	 sexual	 gratification	 with	 a	 member	 of	 the
same	sex	as	a	goal.	The	second	and	third	of	these
components	are	dependency	and	power	motives,
in	 which	 the	 individual	 seeks	 nonsexual	 goals
through	 the	 use	 of	 the	 genitals.	 Ovesey	 defines
worry	about	such	strivings	as	pseudohomosexual
anxiety.	He	maintains	that	paranoid	projection	is	a
common	 defense	 against	 pseudohomosexuality,
but	he	concedes	that	all	three	motives	are	present
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
959
in	 various	 degrees	 in	 all	 homosexuality	 (see
HOMOSEXUALITY).	Ovesey’s	main	contribution	is
to	remind	us	that	the	patient	can	misinterpret	his
own	power	and	dependency	strivings	as	feminine,
or	 dream	 or	 conceive	 of	 them	 in	 homosexual
terms.	 This	 leads	 to	 anxiety	 about	 being	 a
“homosexual,”	 which	 can	 then	 lead	 to	 paranoid
defenses.	The	question	of	why	the	patient	chooses
genital	 expression	 of	 his	 power	 and	 dependency
strivings	is	unanswered.
A	 similar	 concept	 is	 presented	 by	 Kohut
(1978).	 He	 describes	 the	 regression	 that	 takes
place	 during	 a	 therapist’s	 vacation	 when	 the
patient,	who	is	seeking	an	idealized	parent	imago,
becomes	 involved	 in	 a	 homosexual	 episode.	 The
sexualization	 provides	 a	 sense	 of	 aliveness,	 self-
cohesion,	 gratification,	 and	 mastery	 over	 a
situation	 in	 which	 the	 patient	 feels	 in	 serious
danger	 of	 fragmentation	 of	 the	 self	 (see	 SELF
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
960
PSYCHOLOGY).
Melanie	 Klein	 used	 the	 concept	 of	 paranoid
position	 in	 a	 very	 special	 way	 (see	 KLEIN).	 She
postulated	a	fluctuating	process	in	which	paranoid
fears	and	suspicions	are	reinforced	as	a	regressive
defense	 against	 the	 anxieties	 associated	 with
depressive	 position.	 Meissner	 (1978)	 gives	 an
elaborate	neo-Kleinian	interpretation	of	paranoia
with	only	passing	reference	to	Kohut’s	theories.

PART	OBJECT
(see	OBJECT)
PATIENCE
In	one	of	his	most	beautiful	definitions,	Samuel
Johnson	(1773)	defines	patience	as	“the	power	of
suffering;	calm	endurance	of	pain	or	labour	…	the
quality	 of	 expecting	 long	 without	 rage	 or
discontent	 …	 perseverance	 …	 the	 quality	 of
bearing	 offences	 without	 revenge	 or	 anger”	 (p.
1411).	 Of	 all	 the	 qualities	 required	 of	 the
psychoanalytically	 oriented	 psychotherapist,	 this
is	 perhaps	 the	 most	 important.	 Again	 and	 again
patients	 fear	 that	 the	 therapist,	 like	 the	 patient’s
busy,	 harassed,	 and	 overwhelmed	 parents,	 will
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
965
run	out	of	patience	either	with	the	demands	or	the
complaints	voiced	in	therapy	sessions.	Or	they	fear
that	the	therapist,	like	the	narcissistic	parent,	will
demand	 immediate	 improvement	 and	 instant
gratification,	so	that	the	patient	not	only	will	have
to	 flatter	 and	 love	 the	 therapist	 but	 will	 have	 to
bring	 the	 therapist	 proof	 that	 his	 or	 her
interpretations	are	correct.
The	therapist	has	to	maintain	patience	in	spite
of	 a	 patient’s	 complaints	 that	 no	 cure	 is	 taking
place.	He	or	she	must	often	tolerate	pressure	from
the	 patient’s	 own	 family,	 including	 insinuations
that	 the	 therapist	 is	 out	 to	 cheat,	 exploit,	 or
brainwash	the	patient.	Perhaps	hardest	of	all,	the
therapist	must	bear	with	the	clamor	of	third-party
payers	 for	 documentation	 and	 proof	 that	 the
treatment	 is	 necessary	 and	 should	 continue.	 The
therapist,	
by	
example	
and	
by	
proper
interpretation,	 has	 to	 help	 the	 patient	 develop
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
966
tolerance	 toward	 these	 pressures	 and	 has	 to
maintain	a	certain	conviction	that	the	process	will
ultimately	prevail	and	be	worthwhile.
The	importance	of	the	silent	manifestations	of
the	therapist’s	patience,	experienced	over	years	of
therapy,	 has	 not	 been	 given	 the	 attention	 in	 the
literature	that	it	deserves.	The	occasional	reported
cases	 of	 analyses	 with	 Freud	 as	 he	 grew	 sicker,
older,	and	more	irascible	indicate	that	at	times	he
ran	
out	
of	
patience,	
sometimes	
abruptly
terminating	the	treatment,	to	the	detriment	of	the
patient.	Kardiner	(1977),	although	a	questionable
source,	 since	 his	 report	 is	 essentially	 a	 failed	 six
month’s	 analysis	 with	 Freud,	 quotes	 Freud	 as
saying	in	1921	at	the	age	of	65,	“I	have	no	patience
in	keeping	people	for	a	long	time.	I	tire	of	them,
and	I	want	to	spread	my	influence”	(p.	69).
The	 work	 of	 Kohut	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
967
has	 perhaps	 made	 it	 easier	 for	 therapists	 to	 be
patient,	 because	 the	 apparently	 self-centered	 or
narcissistic	 demands	 made	 on	 the	 therapist	 day
after	day	become	more	understandable	in	the	light
of	 archaic	 grandiosity	 and	 the	 search	 for	 an
idealized	parent	imago.	This	allows	the	therapist
to	 accept	 these	 demands	 without	 meeting	 them,
but	 also	 without	 arguing	 with	 the	 patient’s
interpretation	of	“reality”	and	without	moralizing
or	condemning	the	patient.
One	
must	
never	
forget	
that	
each
psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis	 is	 unique,	 and
because	 of	 adhesiveness	 of	 the	 libido	 (see
ADHESIVENESS	OF	THE	LIBIDO)	or	fixation	to	an
archaic	 self/selfobject	 bond	 (Muslin	 1989),	 or
other	 factors,	 each	 patient	 unfolds	 on	 his	 or	 her
unique	timetable	even	with	the	best	of	therapists.
Attempts	 to	 hurry	 this	 are	 not	 only	 unempathic,
they	 are	 unwise	 and	 counterproductive.	 The
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
968
therapist	 must	 tune	 in	 to	 the	 rhythm	 of	 the
patient.
But	 even	 the	 best	 analyzed	 and	 insightful
therapist	 will	 find	 his	 or	 her	 patience	 taxed	 at
times,	 and	 will	 have	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 empathic
lapses	that	inevitably	result.	This	is	an	important
test	of	the	therapist’s	continuing	self-analysis	and
therapeutic	skills,	and	often	the	success	or	failure
of	 a	 long-term	 treatment	 hinges	 on	 it.	 As	 one
matures,	 one	 becomes	 more	 patient,	 and	 this
should	 manifest	 itself	 both	 in	 the	 life	 of	 the
therapist	 and	 the	 patient.	 Patience	 can	 be
understood	either	traditionally	as	the	capacity	of	a
strong	ego	to	span	time	and	withstand	frustration,
or	as	a	manifestation	of	a	strong	cohesive	sense	of
self	that	is	not	thrown	into	disequilibrium	by	the
inevitable	 narcissistic	 wounds	 that	 a	 long-term
psychotherapy	entails.

PATRON
Johnson’s	(1773)	famous	definition	of	a	patron
as	“a	wretch	who	supports	with	insolence	and	is
paid	
with	
flattery”	
(p.	
1412)	
is	
worth
remembering	 when	 we	 consider	 to	 what	 extent
third-party	 payers	 and	 insurance	 companies	 are
involved	in	the	financial	support	of	treatment.	The
difficulty	 becomes	 even	 more	 complex	 when	 we
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
970
remember	 that	 many	 young	 patients,	 especially
adolescents,	are	having	their	bill	paid	by	parents
or	
other	
relatives.	
This	
always	
poses	
a
considerable	 danger	 to	 the	 psychotherapy	 or
psychoanalysis.
Third-party	 payers	 and	 insurance	 companies
do	 not	 demand	 flattery,	 but	 they	 do	 have	 the
insolence	to	demand	a	great	deal	of	very	personal
information	 about	 the	 patient	 before	 they	 are
willing	to	make	payments.	This	places	the	patient
in	 a	 terrible	 dilemma	 because	 there	 is	 no
reasonable	
way	
to	
be	
assured	
that	
this
information	will	remain	private,	even	though	the
insurance	
companies	
or	
third-party	
payers
maintain	 they	 will	 use	 caution.	 This	 becomes
especially	acute	when	insurance	claims	have	to	be
filed	through	the	insurance	office	at	the	patient’s
place	of	employment.	I	have	often	treated	patients
who	were	entitled	to	insurance	payments	but	who
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
971
refused	 to	 file	 the	 claims	 because	 they	 were
certain	 that	 the	 insurance	 office	 at	 the	 patient’s
place	 of	 employment	 would	 use	 their	 case
material	for	other	purposes.	I	was	not	in	a	position
to	 prove	 that	 this	 behavior	 was	 paranoid	 or	 to
reassure	 the	 patients	 that	 it	 would	 not	 happen.
The	problem	has	reached	a	scandalous	proportion
in	our	country.
The	 flattery	 aspect	 of	 Johnson’s	 definition	 is
also	 pertinent;	 a	 serious	 countertransference
involvement	can	take	place	between	the	therapist
and	the	patient’s	family	members	who	are	paying
for	 the	 treatment.	 Because	 they	 pay	 for	 the
treatment,	family	members	often	demand	the	right
to	either	interfere	with	the	therapy	or	to	have	the
therapist	 share	 with	 them	 all	 sorts	 of	 private
information.	 They	 also	 use	 withholding	 of
payment	as	a	way	to	punish	the	therapist	or	even
to	
punish	
the	
patient	
for	
changing.	
This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
972
enormously	 complicates	 good	 psychoanalytic	 or
psychotherapeutic	work.
In	my	clinical	experience,	it	is	often	better	to
allow	 the	 patient	 to	 pay	 a	 very	 small	 fee	 for	 the
sessions	 than	 to	 take	 a	 large	 fee	 from	 relatives
who,	 however	 well	 meaning,	 can	 entangle	 the
patient	 and	 therapist	 in	 a	 web	 of	 control	 and
manipulation.	 The	 integrity	 of	 the	 therapist	 and
the	therapist’s	serious	dedication	to	the	patient’s
best	interests	are	often	demonstrated	by	how	the
therapist	 deals	 with	 patrons,	 and	 by	 what
sacrifices	the	therapist	is	willing	to	make	in	order
to	 protect	 the	 patient	 from	 the	 interference	 of
patrons.

PENIS	ENVY
(see	also	ENVY,	FEMALE	PSYCHOLOGY)
Freud	(1925)	wrote,	“A	little	girl	…	makes	her
judgment	and	her	decision	in	a	flash.	She	has	seen
it	and	knows	that	she	is	without	it	and	wants	to
have	 it”	 (p.	 252).	 What	 is	 penis	 envy?	 Is	 it	 a
defensive	act,	as	Clower	(1979)	has	said,	a	turning
away	from	the	mother	“too	far”	so	as	to	deny	the
longing	for	her?	Is	it	a	two-stage	development	of
feminine	 identity,	 as	 Greenacre	 (summarized	 by
Tyson	 1982)	 believes?	 Or	 is	 penis	 envy	 just	 an
invention	of	chauvinistic	male	psychoanalysts,	as
Horney	 (1967)	 thought—a	 view	 that	 some
feminists	still	endorse?	In	Greenacre’s	theory,	the
first	phase	of	penis	envy	is	thought	to	take	place	in
the	 middle	 of	 the	 second	 year	 and	 is	 frequently
experienced	 by	 the	 girl	 as	 a	 normally	 transient
narcissistic	 wound.	 However,	 some	 authors
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
974
believe	 that	 this	 new	 awareness	 functions	 as	 a
psychic	 organizer	 and,	 in	 normal	 development,
leads	to	an	increased	feminine	identification	with
the	mother	and	a	consequent	firming	of	a	healthy
sense	of	femaleness.
In	 the	 second	 phase,	 at	 around	 the	 age	 of	 3,
after	 the	 foundations	 of	 female	 gender	 role
identity	have	been	laid,	genital	masturbation	and
exhibitionism	 increase.	 During	 this	 early	 phallic
phase,	penis	preoccupation	and	penis	envy	reign
supreme	in	what	Greenacre	(1953)	refers	to	as	the
“second	 peak	 of	 the	 experience	 of	 envy”	 (p.	 33).
Resolution	of	this	allows	the	girl	to	identify	more
fully	 with	 the	 mother’s	 femininity	 and	 further
consolidates	 the	 female	 gender	 identity,	 after
which	the	girl	is	ready	to	enter	into	a	true	oedipal
love	relationship	with	the	father.
Arlow	(1986)	describes	a	case	illustrating	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
975
classical	current	psychoanalytic	view	of	a	woman’s
persistent	 unconscious	 wish	 for	 a	 penis.	 Other
authors	 view	 penis	 envy	 as	 a	 function	 or
expression	 of	 the	 narcissistic	 wounding	 from
unsuccessful	competition	between	girls	and	boys
in	 our	 male-oriented	 culture.	 For	 Tyson	 (1982),
rather	than	castration	issues,	“it	is	with	little	girls
and	 boys	 alike,	 that	 the	 threat	 of	 narcissistic
mortification	 and	 resulting	 loss	 of	 self-esteem	 at
continuing	 oedipal	 failure	 provides	 an	 essential
motivation	 for	 relinquishing	 oedipal	 wishes”	 (p.
79).	 Research	 on	 pathological	 resolution	 of	 the
Oedipus	complex	is	also	much	needed.
What	light	does	self	psychology	throw	on	these
problems?	 Elsewhere	 (see	 Chessick	 1983)	 I
discussed	Marilyn	Monroe’s	wish	to	have	a	baby	as
a	pathological	attempt	to	heal	a	defective	self,	as
compared	 with	 the	 normal	 assertive	 feminine
wish	to	have	a	child,	as	described	by	Kohut	(1978).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
976
Schafer	(1974)	points	out	that	there	is	a	curious
lack	 of	 interest	 in	 Freud’s	 writings	 about	 the
background	 of	 the	 so-called	 castration	 shock	 in
girls.	 Schafer	 says	 this	 is	 due	 to	 Freud’s
evolutionary	 model,	 his	 preoccupation	 with	 the
organs	 of	 reproduction	 in	 nineteenth-century
biology.	For	Freud,	a	woman	above	all	must	yearn
to	reproduce	and	be	prepared	to	love	the	child,	or
the	species	will	not	survive.

PENSION
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
978
Johnson	(1773)	defines	pension	as	follows:	“An
allowance	made	to	anyone	without	an	equivalent.
In	England	it	is	generally	understood	to	mean	pay
given	to	a	state	hireling	for	treason	to	his	country”
(p.	1424).	His	notorious	definition	should	cause	us
to	 pause	 and	 reflect	 on	 the	 effect	 of	 offering
psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis	 for	 nothing	 or
for	a	fee	next	to	nothing.	The	patient	experiences
the	psychoanalytic	work	being	done	as	a	gift,	and
is	therefore	most	reluctant	to	feel	or	express	rage
at	the	therapist	in	the	transference.	The	therapist
has	 an	 inevitable	 sense	 of	 resentment,	 which
sooner	
or	
later	
manifests	
itself	
in
countertransference	 difficulties,	 no	 matter	 how
well	meaning	the	therapist	may	be.	In	those	cases
where	the	therapist	is	a	student	and	works	under
supervision,	 and	 the	 patients	 know	 they	 are
getting	a	reduced	fee	because	of	this,	the	situation
is	more	honest	and	such	problems	are	less	likely
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
979
to	arise.	But	a	therapist	who	accepts	a	long-term
psychotherapy	or	psychoanalytic	patient	at	a	very
low	 fee	 should	 seriously	 question	 himself	 or
herself	
regarding	
secret	
or	
unconscious
motivations.	Self-analysis	is	required,	lest	there	be
treason	to	the	patient.

PERVERSION
Johnson	 (1773)	 defines	 perversion	 as	 a
corruption,	 a	 “change	 to	 something	 worse”	 (p.
1438).	 So	 the	 term	 has	 come	 to	 represent
“something	 worse”	 than	 the	 normal	 genital
heterosexual	 act;	 it	 connotes	 all	 sorts	 of
judgmental	
terms	
such	
as	
“abnormality,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
980
aberration,	 distortion,	 dysfunction;	 any	 deviation
from	 the	 correct,	 proper,	 expected,	 or	 normal
range”	 (Campbell	 1989,	 p.	 534).	 A	 perversion
refers	 to	 some	 deviation	 from	 the	 normal
heterosexual	 means	 of	 reaching	 genital	 orgasm,
see	DSM-III-R	(1987)	for	a	classification.
Many	of	the	so-called	perversions	are	found	to
be	part	of	normal	sexual	foreplay,	although	not	all
of	 them.	 The	 difference	 is	 that	 in	 the	 case	 of
perversion,	 the	 behavior	 brings	 about	 genital
orgasm,	whereas	in	normal	heterosexual	behavior
the	act	is	only	a	minor	part	of	foreplay	leading	to
increasing	 sexual	 excitement.	 The	 activity	 of	 the
perversion	becomes	an	end	in	itself.
Freud	(1905)	believed	that	neuroses	were	the
opposite	 of	 perversions.	 He	 argued	 that	 all
children	 are	 polymorphously	 perverse	 in	 both
their	behavior	and	their	fantasies,	and	that	lying	at
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
981
the	root	of	psychoneuroses	and	perverse	behavior
were	 these	 fantasies	 from	 the	 various	 stages	 of
child	 psychosexual	 development.	 The	 fantasies
themselves	 must	 be	 viewed	 as	 compromise
formations	 among	 the	 id,	 the	 superego,	 and	 the
demands	of	reality	developed	by	the	patient’s	ego.
In	 the	 perversions	 the	 libidinal	 investments	 in
certain	 behaviors	 are	 carried	 directly	 into	 adult
life	
and	
not	
repressed,	
whereas	
in	
the
psychoneuroses	 these	 wishes	 and	 behaviors	 are
repressed	 and	 appear	 in	 the	 form	 of	 neurotic
symptoms.
It	should	be	remembered	that	the	perversions
are	 also	 compromise	 formations	 and	 have
complex	 and	 multidetermined	 functions.	 An
important	 unconscious	 fantasy	 that	 is	 crucial	 in
many	 perversions	 is	 the	 denial	 of	 castration;	 at
some	 deep	 level	 many	 patients	 with	 perversions
attempt	 to	 disavow	 the	 anatomical	 distinction
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
982
between	 the	 sexes.	 It	 has	 been	 recognized	 that
perversions	 serve	 many	 other	 functions.	 For
example,	 the	 exhibitionist	 is	 really	 assaulting
women	and	expressing	a	hatred	of	and	aggression
toward	 them,	 beside	 reassuring	 himself	 by	 a
woman’s	shock	that	he	does	have	a	penis.
Due	to	the	long-standing	negative	connotations
of	the	term	“perversion,”	these	disorders	are	often
referred	to	as	paraphilias	or	sexual	deviations.	In	a
paraphilia,	 what	 excites	 the	 patient	 is	 some
unusual	object	or	quality	of	the	object;	in	a	sexual
deviation,	behavior	during	sexual	activity	is	clearly
abnormal	or	is	that	usually	seen	only	to	a	minor
extent	during	foreplay.
The	literature	is	replete	with	case	examples	of
perversions,	but	it	must	be	kept	in	mind	that	we
may	never	see	in	the	office	a	great	many	patients
with	perversions,	given	the	proper	partner	and	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
983
not-too-dangerous	 perversion.	 Perversions	 are
extremely	 difficult	 to	 treat	 and	 are	 often
accompanied	by	a	great	many	other	neurotic	and
sometimes	 psychotic	 symptoms.	 I	 have	 treated	 a
number	 of	 cases	 of	 perversion	 in	 which	 the
particular	perversion	was	stopped	because	it	was
extremely	 dangerous	 to	 the	 career	 or	 life	 of	 the
patient	 or	 his	 or	 her	 partner,	 but	 this	 often
resulted	 in	 a	 serious	 exacerbation	 of	 neurotic	 or
paranoid	 symptoms.	 The	 neurotic	 or	 paranoid
symptoms	 caused	 the	 patient	 great	 difficulty	 but
threatened	
less	
danger	
from	
society	
and
consequently	 appeared	 to	 the	 patient	 as	 a
reasonable	tradeoff.	This	is	another	way	of	saying
that	 when	 the	 compromise	 formation	 that
constitutes	 a	 perversion	 is	 broken	 up,	 the	 ego
must	 find	 other	 compromise	 formations	 and	 the
patient	 is	 far	 from	 cured.	 Kleinians	 in	 particular
emphasize	the	sadistic	nature	of	the	perversions,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
984
and	 many	 tend	 to	 regard	 all	 perversions	 as	 a
manifestation	 of	 the	 death	 instinct	 (see	 DEATH
INSTINCT).

PHALLUS
The	phallus,	or	male	genital,	has	been	used	to
connote	a	great	many	things,	both	in	literature	and
in	 psychoanalysis.	 Freud	 used	 the	 concept	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
985
phallic	 phase	 to	 refer	 to	 a	 period	 beginning	 at
about	2	or	3	years	of	age	and	lasting	through	the
oedipal	phase	of	development.	During	this	period
the	phallus	becomes	the	primary	erogenous	zone
for	 both	 sexes.	 Also	 during	 this	 phase	 the
psychosexual	development	of	boys	diverges	from
that	of	girls.
A	 “phallic	 woman”	 has	 been	 pejoratively
defined	 as	 a	 woman	 who	 has	 so-called	 phallic
personality	
traits	
involving	
aggression,
assertiveness,	and	strength,	characteristics	usually
associated	with	masculinity.	A	woman	who	asserts
herself	
professionally	
or	
even	
socially,
unfortunately	is	often	so	labeled.
Phallic	narcissism	refers	to	an	overestimation
of	one’s	penis	and	a	preoccupation	with	so-called
phallic	 behavior	 or	 traits,	 as	 defined	 above.	 This
often	can	become	fixed	into	the	phallic	character
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
986
disorder,	 which	 is	 now	 included	 under	 the
narcissistic	 personality	 disorders	 in	 DSM-III-R
(1987).	
Patients	
who	
suffer	
from	
phallic
narcissism	 are	 traditionally	 viewed	 as	 dealing
with	
unconscious	
castration	
anxiety.	
(Self
psychology	views	narcissism	quite	differently;	see
NARCISSISM.)	 The	 so-called	 macho	 man	 is	 the
classic	 example	 of	 this,	 but	 it	 should	 be	 pointed
out	that	women	can	exhibit	phallic	narcissism	by
unconsciously	 equating	 their	 entire	 body	 as	 a
phallus	 and	 displaying	 their	 body	 with	 the	 same
abandon	 as	 “macho”	 activities.	 In	 such	 patients
there	is	usually	a	strong	unconscious	dependency
and	 attempt	 to	 deny	 this	 dependency	 by
exhibitionism	 and	 aggressive	 activities.	 These
aggressive	 activities	 may	 also	 be	 based	 on	 a
concept	 of	 the	 penis	 as	 a	 sadistic	 or	 attacking
weapon,	 and	 indeed,	 sexual	 behavior	 in	 a	 phallic
narcissistic	 individual	 often	 has	 a	
sadistic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
987
component	 and	 conveys	 a	 depreciation	 of
members	of	the	opposite	sex.	At	the	extreme	end
of	the	interpretations	of	phallic	narcissism	and	of
the	 phallic	 character	 is	 the	 Kleinian	 theory	 (see
OBJECT	RELATIONS	THEORY).	Klein	postulated	an
unconscious	 equation	 of	 the	 penis	 with	 the	 “bad
breast”	 seen	 as	 a	 penetrating,	 destructive,	 and
poisonous	 implement.	 Out	 of	 anxiety	 the	 patient
identifies	with	the	feared	aggressor.
The	 concept	 of	 phallocentrism	 has	 been
introduced	recently	by	feminists	to	remind	us	that
Western	
culture	
tends	
to	
exaggerate	
the
importance	of	the	phallus	and	of	what	is	attributed
to	masculinity	in	the	Western	value	system.	Traits
often	 attributed	 to	 femininity,	 such	 as	 passivity,
masochism,	 and	 dependency,	 are	 often	 treated
disparagingly.
Lacan	(1978)	labels	the	phallus	as	the	signifier
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
988
of	the	patient’s	basic	desire,	to	be	desired	by	the
other,	a	notion	he	borrowed	from	Kojeve’s	(1969)
reading	of	Hegel.	He	sometimes	uses	the	term	to
represent	this	general	signifier	and	at	other	times
to	refer	specifically	to	the	penis,	so	the	implication
would	 be	 that	 the	 basic	 desire	 of	 the	 patient’s
mother	is	to	have	a	penis.	This	is	a	form	of	very
classical	 Freudianism,	 but	 it	 also	 involves	 a
disparagement	of	women,	which	is	found	in	many
of	Lacan’s	writings	(see	Mitchell	and	Rose	1982).
An	 outmoded	 term,	 the	 “phallic	 mother,”
represents	 a	 woman	 who	 is	 endowed	 in	 fantasy
with	 a	 phallus.	 The	 image	 of	 a	 woman	 equipped
with	 male	 sexual	 organs	 is	 often	 met	 with	 in
dreams	and	fantasies.

PHANTASY
(see	also	FANTASY)
The	 term	 “phantasy”	 is	 used	 in	 the	 British
psychoanalytic	literature,	especially	in	the	writing
of	 the	 Kleinians.	 For	 them,	 phantasy	 has	 a	 very
specific	 and	 object-related	 meaning	 involving
whole	 or	 part	 objects	 (see	 OBJECT	 and	 OBJECT
RELATIONS	 THEORY).	 These	 archaic	 self	 and
object	 representations	 are	 imaginative	 activities
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
990
underlying	 all	 subsequent	 thought	 and	 feeling
(e.g.,	 in	 the	 paranoid-schizoid	 and	 depressive
positions).
Unconscious	fantasies	are	very	important,	and
the	disagreement	is	only	on	the	type	and	kind	of
fantasies	that	develop	in	the	earliest	years	of	life.
For	
the	
Kleinians,	
“phantasies”	
are	
direct
expressions	 of	 the	 death	 instinct	 and	 necessarily
involve	objects	or	part	objects.	For	American	ego
psychologists,	
fantasies	
are	
compromise
formations	 developed	 early	 in	 childhood	 to	 deal
with	 the	 demands	 of	 the	 id,	 external	 reality,	 and
the	superego.	Once	these	compromise	formations
are	developed,	they	have	a	profound	effect	on	the
patient’s	 further	 perceptions,	 judgments,	 and
activities	(see	FANTASY).
PHANTOM	LIMB
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
991
(see	also	ALLON)
An	exploration	of	the	concept	of	the	phantom
limb	 offers	 an	 excellent	 opportunity	 to	 consider
the	value	of	phenomenology	to	psychiatry	and,	in
particular,	 the	 work	 of	 the	 phenomenologist-
psychiatrist	 Erwin	 Straus	 (1891-1975).	 (For	 a
concise	review,	see	Melzack	1992.)
The	 phantom	 limb	 phenomenon	 represents	 a
feeling	an	individual	has	that	an	extremity	that	has
been	 lost	 is	 really	 present.	 This	 does	 not
necessarily	 have	 to	 be	 an	 extremity	 of	 the	 body
per	se;	for	example,	I	noticed	that	when	I	stopped
smoking	a	pipe	I	had	the	constant	sensation	that
the	pipe,	which	I	used	to	have	continuously	in	my
hand	 or	 mouth,	 was	 still	 there.	 I	 often	 found
myself	reaching	for	it	to	light	it	or	start	to	smoke
it.	Clearly,	objects	like	a	pipe	or	the	violin	of	the
professional	 violinist	 become	 closely	 associated
with	 one’s	 body	 image.	 The	 body	 is	 perceived
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
992
through	 external	 tactile	 sensations	 and	 internal
sensations	
of	
depth	
sensibility.	
The	
body
representation	in	the	phantom	limb	phenomenon
becomes	 placed	 in	 the	 foreground	 because	 the
patient	 has	 great	 difficulty	 in	 correlating	 it	 with
the	 objective	 reality	 of	 the	 absence	 of	 an
extremity.
As	is	well	known	to	neurologists,	the	phantom
gradually	shrinks	and	the	body	image	changes	in
due	course	in	normal	individuals.	In	most	cases,	it
disappears	 into	 the	 stump.	 The	 remarkable
ubiquity	 of	 this	 phenomenon	 indicates	 that	 it	 is
not	 by	 itself	 abnormal	 or	 neurotic;	 only	 the
prolonged	 persistence	 of	 it	 or	 the	 investment	 of
the	 phantom	 limb	 with	 pain	 indicates	 emotional
disturbance.
Straus	 (1966)	 emphasizes	 the	 way	 in	 which
each	
human	
being	
organizes	
his	
or	
her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
993
experiences	of	the	environment	in	perception	and
inner	 experience	 history.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 he
does	 not	 recognize	 the	 role	 of	 the	 unconscious,
especially	 unconscious	 fantasy	 processes,	 in
affecting	
an	
individual’s	
perspective	
and
experiences	of	the	environment,	as	well	as	his	or
her	 organization	 of	 those	 experiences.	 Many
concepts	 in	 psychoanalysis	 have	 their	 roots	 in
physicalistic	 thinking,	 such	 as	 the	 environmental
influences	affecting	the	developing	human	being	in
self	psychology	and	the	influences	of	the	parents
and	the	child’s	internal	representations	of	them	in
object	relations	theory.	Straus	insists	that	mental
existence	 must	 be	 studied	 as	 an	 individual
conscious	historical	continuum.	Here	his	thinking
is	closer	to	that	of	Sartre	(1981)	in	his	studies	of
Flaubert.	I	think	Straus	would	approve	of	the	kind
of	progressive/regressive	method	used	by	Sartre
in	 an	 effort	 to	 totalize	 the	 inner	 conscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
994
continuum	 of	 the	 mental	 experiences	 of	 an
individual	 that	 reflect	 what	 Sartre	 labels	 that
individual’s	basic	project.
Straus	proposed	to	make	a	science	of	the	life-
historical	experience	of	subjectivity	the	theoretical
foundation	 for	 psychoanalysis,	 a	 historiological
foundation	
emphasizing	
subject-centered
experience.	 Whether	 psychoanalysis	 should	 be
characterized	 as	 a	 hermeneutic	 of	 the	 historical
stream	of	experience	that	Binswanger	(May	et	al.
1958)	 called	 the	 “inner	 life	 history”	 or	 not,
remains	highly	controversial.
One	of	the	weaknesses	of	Straus’s	work	for	the
American	 psychiatrist	 and	 psychoanalyst	 is	 that
his	 terminology	 has	 become	 obsolete	 since	 the
advent	 of	 DSM-III-R	 (1987).	 Furthermore,	 it	 has
been	shown	that	the	“phobic	neuroses”	and	panic
disorders	
discussed	
by	
Straus	
in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
995
phenomenological	 terms	 can	 be	 in	 some	 cases
traced	 to	 biochemical	 imbalances	 and	 respond
relatively	
rapidly	
to	
proper
psychopharmacological	
and/or	
behavioral
treatment.	 My	 experience	 with	 Straus	 convinces
me	 he	 would	 have	 welcomed	 this	 development
and	 would	 have	 been	 eager	 to	 work	 it	 into	 his
holistic	 biological	 theory,	 just	 as	 he	 did	 for
patients	 with	 general	 paresis	 in	 his	 efforts	 to
understand	 their	 inner	 life	 experience.	 More
important	for	American	psychoanalysts	is	the	fact
that,	as	Brautigam	(Straus	1982)	explains,	“Straus
was	more	sympathetic	with	the	luminous	surface
than	with	the	deep-lying	passions	and	the	human
instinctual	 world,	 more	 at	 home	 with	 the	 real
conflicts	and	existential	wrong-attitudes	than	with
the	sexual	and	aggressive	motives	arising	from	the
archaic	depths”	(p.	9).
This	 forms	 an	 unbridgeable	 gap	 between	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
996
work	 of	 Straus	 and	 the	 current	 work	 of	 many
depth	 psychologists	 and	 psychoanalysts.	 Straus
tended	 to	 stay	 meticulously	 with	 the	 conscious
surface	because	he	did	not	appreciate	or	concede
the	 power	 of	 unconscious	 fantasy	 process	 in
determining	 the	 patient’s	 inner	 subjective	 life
history.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 Straus	 deserves	 credit
for	being	one	of	the	first	thinkers	to	observe	that
Freud’s	
metapsychology,	
based	
on	
a
hydrodynamic	model	and	utilizing	such	concepts
as	energy	and	cathexis,	was	really	a	vague	notion
that	 tended	 to	 produce	 a	 reductionism	 and
obscurity	 rather	 than	 an	 understanding	 of	 the
individual	patient’s	experience.	There	has	been	a
general	
acknowledgment	
that	
Freud’s
metapsychology	 represents	 an	 inadequate	 model
of	 human	 mentation,	 and	 few	 psychoanalysts
adhere	
strictly	
to	
it	
today	
(see
METAPSYCHOLOGY).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
997
There	 is	 an	 interesting	 affinity	 between	 the
approach	 of	 Straus	 and	 that	 of	 Kohut’s	 self
psychology	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY).	 In	 both
instances,	 there	 is	 an	 exceptional	 effort	 to	 get	 in
touch	with	the	way	the	patient	is	experiencing	the
world.	 The	 self	 psychologist	 does	 this	 through
empathy	 and	 vicarious	 introspection,	 while	 the
phenomenologist	 does	 this	 through	 meticulous
study	 of	 the	 patient’s	 conscious	 reports	 (see
PHENOMENOLOGY).
It	 is	 clear	 that	 Straus	 (1982)	 was	 also	 much
influenced	 by	 Husserl	 when	 he	 refers	 to	 the
“natural	 attitude”	 (p.	 26).	 He	 clearly	 opposes	 the
Cartesian	distinction	between	subject	and	object,
which	 I	 think	 remained	 a	 stumbling	 block	 in	 the
work	 of	 Husserl.	 One	 of	 the	 most	 important
contributions	of	Straus	was	his	attempt	to	develop
an	 awareness	 in	 practicing	 psychiatrists	 and
psychoanalysts	 that	 an	 understanding	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
998
patient’s	 inner	 experiences	 may	 be	 achieved
through	 phenomenology.	 Both	 the	 methods	 of
phenomenology	 and	 of	 self	 psychology	 are
complementary	 to	 the	 more	 reductionistic	 or
traditional	psychoanalytic	viewpoint.
One	
of	
the	
main	
gaps	
between	
the
epistemology	
of	
psychoanalysis	
and	
the
phenomenology	of	Erwin	Straus	is	in	his	concept
of	 the	 “existential-neurosis”	 (1982,	 p.	 30).	 The
traditional	 view	 sees	 neuroses	 as	 based	 on
conflicts	 and	 compromise	 formations,	 but	 Straus
emphasized	 the	 problems	 involved	 in	 various
forms	of	human	existence,	a	much	more	conscious
psychology,	 again	 more	 akin	 to	 the	 approach	 of
Sartre	than	to	the	approach	of	Freud.	Depending
on	whether	a	neurosis	is	thought	of	as	a	conflict
neurosis	
or	
an	
“existential-neurosis,”	
the
therapist’s	interventions	will	be	quite	different,	so
a	major	incompatibility	arises.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
999
The	 phenomenologist	 will	 concentrate	 on
examining	 the	 meticulous	 details	 of	 the	 patient’s
lived	
experience,	
while	
the	
traditional
psychoanalyst	 will	 rely	 on	 free	 association	 and
interpretation	 to	 uncover	 unconscious	 conflicts
and	their	concomitant	fantasy	processes.	It	should
be	clear	from	this	why	Straus’s	approach	is	more
easily	 acceptable	 in	 the	 examination	 of	 organic
syndromes,	and	much	more	controversial	when	it
is	applied	to	the	neuroses	or	character	disorders
commonly	 seen	 in	 the	 outpatient	 work	 of	 a
psychoanalyst.

PHENOMENOLOGY
Phenomenology	may	be	thought	of	as	a	style	of
thinking	 that	 suspends	 traditional	 scientific
explanation	and	attempts	to	get	in	touch	with	the
primordial	 experiences	 underlying	 all	 our	 more
mature	 constructions	 of	 the	 world.	 Edmund
Husserl	
(1913)	
first	
introduced	
his
phenomenological	 method	 as	 a	 way	 of	 doing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1001
philosophy	 in	 the	 early	 1900s.	 His	 pupil,	 Martin
Heidegger,	 took	 up	 this	 method,	 although	 he
completely	
changed	
Husserl’s	
orientation.
Heidegger	 applied	 it	 to	 investigating	 the	 human
condition,	his	so-called	existential	analytic,	in	his
most	famous	and	influential	work,	Being	and	Time
(1962).	 This	 remarkable	 work	 spawned	 a	 school
of	
psychiatric	
treatment	
on	
the	
European
continent	 whose	 most	 prominent	 practitioners
were	 Ludwig	 Binswanger	 and	 Menard	 Boss,
among	 others.	 All	 of	 these	 in	 turn,	 however,
presented	 a	 hodgepodge	 of	 approaches,	 each	 of
which	differed	from	Husserl’s	original	method	and
intent	(Kockelmans	1967).	Their	publications	pose
formidable	
difficulties	
for	
United	
States
psychiatrists,	who	as	a	rule	are	not	familiar	with

Phenomenology	 received	 a	 brief	 flurry	 of
interest	in	the	1950s	in	the	United	States	when	a
small	school	of	“existential	psychiatrists”	claiming
an	affinity	to	phenomenology	appeared.	It	is	only
after	
two	
further	
developments	
that	
the
phenomenological	 approach	 has	 again	 claimed
attention	here	in	psychiatry.	The	first	of	these	was
Kohut’s	(1971,	1977)	psychology	of	the	self,	with
its	emphasis	on	the	sense	of	self	as	it	appears	at
birth	 and	 emerges	 with	 vicissitudes	 throughout
various	 phases	 of	 development.	 This	 led	 to	 a
resurgence	 of	 interest	 in	 infant	 research	 among
psychiatrists,	although	Kohut	confined	his	work	to
the	 clinical	 situation.	 Infant	 research	 lends	 itself
nicely	 to	 a	 phenomenological	 approach,	
a
description	 of	 the	 observed	 infant	 experience
without	 prior	 logical	 or	 conceptual	 categories,
since	whatever	is	observed	is	prelinguistic.	This	is
not	 to	 be	 confused	 with	 the	 pioneering	 work	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1003
Mahler	
and	
her	
colleagues	
(1975),	
who
approached	
their	
infant	
observations	
with
strongly	 held	 theoretical	 preconceptions	 (Brody
1982,	 Tanguay	 1977).	 The	 second	 development
came	 from	 a	 new	 generation	 of	 psychiatrists	 in
Europe,	 mostly	 German,	 who	 took	 their	 starting
point	 from	 the	 extensions	 and	 modifications	 of
Heidegger’s	
work	
by	
Gadamer	
(1982;	
see
HERMENEUTICS).
Phenomenology	 requires	 the	 psychiatrist	 and
psychotherapist	to	be	tolerant	of	unfamiliar	terms
and	 ways	 of	 stating	 things,	 of	 difficult	 new
concepts	 that	 are	 not	 easily	 and	 immediately
grasped	 but	 require	 prolonged	 thought,	 and	 of
ways	of	approach	and	presentation	that,	springing
from	 the	 European	 and	 especially	 the	 German
philosophical	 tradition,	 are	 different	 from	 the
pragmatic	tradition	of	the	United	States.	Since	we
all	 tend	 to	 stay	 with	 the	 familiar	 and	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1004
comfortable,	a	certain	effort	will	be	required	from
the	 psychiatrist	 or	 psychotherapist	 to	 wrench
himself	 or	 herself	 from	 routine	 thinking	 and	 to
concentrate	 in	 a	 different	 manner.	 This	 effort	 is
made	 more	 difficult	 by	 the	 current	 trend	 toward
“medicalization”	of	psychiatry,	which	tends	to	lose
vital	 information	 about	 the	 total	 patient	 that
phenomenology	attempts	to	retrieve.
The	 Greek	 word	 ϕαινομενον	 (phainomenon)
comes	 from	 the	 verb	 ϕαινεσθαι	 (phainesthai),
which	
means	
“that	
which	
shows	
itself.”
Phenomenology	 attempts	 to	 return	 to	 the
primordial	 data	 of	 experience,	 that	 which	 shows
itself	 in	 the	 manner	 in	 which	 it	 shows	 itself.
Phenomena	are	always	prior	to	our	theories	and
concepts;	they	are	immediate	data	but	they	are	not
simply	“appearances,”	for	appearances	are	always
appearances	 of	 something,	 whereas	 phenomena
are	 that	 something	 which	 shows	 itself.	 They	 are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1005
primary,	they	are	what	is.
The	most	important	feature	of	phenomenology
is	that	it	is	in	some	ways	a	nonempirical	science.	It
does	not	describe	empirically	observable	matters
of	 fact,	 and	 it	 does	 not	 lend	 itself	 to	 what
Heidegger	 called	 the	 “calculative	 thinking”	 that
pervades	 our	 time.	 Thus	 phenomenological
statements	 are	 not	 considered	 true	 if	 they
correspond	to	the	observation	of	facts	thought	of
as	“out	there”	in	“reality”;	they	are	considered	true
if	
they	
accurately	
describe	
phenomena
experienced,	 and	 false	 if	 they	 do	 not.	 The
phenomenologist	does	not	frame	theories;	instead,
he	or	she	examines	and	describes	phenomena	as
they	
present	
themselves	
to	
a	
relatively
unprejudiced	view.
Husserl	 (1913)	 believed	 that	 phenomenology
offers	 us	 a	 presuppositionless	 form	 of	 inquiry,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1006
since	it	insists	on	no	prior	theoretical	commitment
and	 demands	 a	 dedication	 to	 try	 to	 operate
without	 any	 unexamined	 assumptions.	 Husserl’s
main	 idea	 was	 that	 the	 examination	 of	 the
phenomena	yielded	the	truths	of	phenomenology
directly—it	 brought	 us	 to	 the	 things	 themselves.
Using	his	method,	Husserl	believed,	things	speak
for	 themselves;	 that	 is	 to	 say,	 instead	 of
understanding	 through	 controlled	 experiments
based	 on	 scientific	 hypotheses,	 understanding	 is
through	an	undergoing	of	experience.
The	confusing	method	of	phenomenology	was
originally	 developed	 by	 Husserl	 under	 the
influence	 of	 Franz	 Brentano	 (1838-1917),	 a
philosopher-psychologist	
who	
developed	
the
notion	of	“intentionality”:	all	acts	of	consciousness
are	directed	toward	some	intentional	object.	That
consciousness	 is	 always	 a	 consciousness	 of
something	 became	 a	 fundamental	 theme	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1007
Husserl’s	 philosophy.	 According	 to	 Jones	 (1953),
Freud	attended	Brentano’s	seminar	in	philosophy
once	a	week	for	a	couple	of	years,	and	some	of	his
teleological	thinking	may	be	traced	to	Brentano’s
influence.	
Husserl	
first	
used	
the	
term
“phenomenologic	method”	in	1900,	and	for	him	it
was	 a	 way	 of	 achieving	 philosophic	 certainty.
Husserl’s	 (1913)	 final	 method	 attempts	 what	 he
called	
transcendental-phenomenological
reduction;	 as	 a	 starting	 point,	 he	 did	 not	 permit
the	selection	out	of	experience	of	certain	specific
things,	 sensations,	 and	 feelings,	 since	 to	 do	 so
would	 assume	 classificatory	 principles	 about	 the
world.	Thus	phenomenological	statements	cannot
be	 called	 empirical,	 because	 empirical	 scientific
statements	 are	 about	 already	 assumed	 “things”
out	 there.	 Phenomenological	 statements	 attempt
what	Husserl	called	presuppositionless	inquiry—
no	 theories,	 just	 descriptions	 of	 phenomena	 as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1008
they	present	themselves	to	an	unprejudiced	view.
Husserl	
defined	
this	
starting	
point	
for
phenomenological	reduction	as	the	“bracketing	of
experience,”	
or	
epoché,	
the	
unbiased
contemplation	of	phenomena	without	intellectual
preconsiderations.	
Then,	
in	
a	
controversial
methodological	 step,	 he	 proposed	 the	 use	 of
“imaginative	 variations”	 to	 intuit	 the	 essence	 of
the	phenomena.	So	for	Husserl,	phenomenological
statements	are	not	empirical;	they	are	ultimately
statements	 about	 the	 intuited	 essence	 of	 the
phenomena,	 and	 in	 this	 way	 they	 lead	 to
philosophical	
certainty.	
Most	
subsequent
proponents	of	phenomenology	have	rejected	this
further	step,	a	rejection	that	caused	Husserl	great
disappointment.
From	the	point	of	view	of	the	psychotherapist,
the	phenomenological	stance	is	to	examine	one’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1009
reaction	 to	 what	 is	 simply	 there	 in	 a	 felt
experience;	 the	 therapist	 does	 not	 disconnect,
isolate,	 or	 interpret	 aspects	 of	 this	 experience.
Epoché,	or	the	bracketing	of	experience,	demands
refrainment	from	judgment	about	morals,	values,
causes,	background,	and	even	from	separating	the
subject	
(patient)	
and	
objective	
observer
(therapist).	 One	 pays	 special	 attention	 to	 one’s
experience	 or	 state	 of	 consciousness	 in	 the
presence	of	a	patient.	The	therapist	must	continue
to	 observe	 and	 listen,	 staying	 with	 the	 patient’s
material	 and	 directly	 experiencing	 the	 patient
rather	than	searching	for	hidden	processes.
Phenomenologists	warn	that	a	distance	can	be
created	between	the	therapist	and	the	patient	by
the	 standard	 interviewing	 technique,	 a	 gap	 that
may	be	unproductively	filled	by	abundant	verbal
material	 and	 analytic	 ideas,	 conceptions,	 and
theories.	 They	 advise	 focusing	 on	 the	 emotional
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1010
interchange,	staying	strictly	with	the	phenomena
presented	by	the	patient	and	concentrating	on	the
experienced	interaction	with	the	patient.
Phenomenological	 reduction	 of	 the	 cognitive
and	 emotional	 distance	 between	 the	 patient	 and
the	 therapist,	 then,	 is	 the	 crucial	 procedure,
leading	 to	 a	 true	 meeting	 or	 encounter	 (Jaspers
1972).	 The	 application	 of	 phenomenology	 to
psychotherapy	 raises	 the	 valid	 question	 of
whether	we	as	therapists	can	be	sure	that	we	are
seeing	and	hearing	our	patients	as	they	really	are,
rather	 than	 as	 projections	 of	 our	 theories	 about
them.	 The	 aim	 of	 phenomenological	 study	 is	 to
rediscover	the	whole	living	person	and	how	being
in	 the	 world	 is	 experienced	 by	 that	 person	 and
those	around	him	or	her	(see	Van	Den	Berg	1955).
All	 the	 modes	 of	 human	 lived	 experience	 can
be	
described	
phenomenologically	
and	
are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1011
interlocked	 with	 our	 constituted	 self	 (Chessick
1992),	so	that	no	hidden	essences	or	entities	are
postulated.	
This	
eliminates	
the	
whole
infrastructure	 of	 metapsychology,	 the	 disease
classifications	 of	 DSM-III-R,	 and,	 above	 all,	 the
classical	notion	of	an	independent	neutral	subject
(e.g.,	the	psychiatrist)	observing	the	outside	world
(e.g.,	 the	 patient)	 through	 collecting	 data	 and
developing	 empirical	 and	 quantitative	 laws	 of
cause	and	effect.
Phenomenology	 has	 a	 useful	 application	 in
psychiatry	and	psychoanalysis.	We	know	that	the
phenomena	of	the	encounter	between	one	person
and	another,	including	that	between	the	therapist
and	 the	 patient,	 always	 are	 interactively	 or
dialectically	 constituted,	 and	 that	 diagnoses	 and
the	 postulation	 of	 psychic	 entities,	 commonly
made	on	the	basis	of	the	phenomena	generated	in
that	encounter,	are	therefore	relative	to	both	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1012
observer	 and	 the	 observed,	 or	 the	 therapist	 and
the	 patient.	 This	 is	 consistent	 with	 quantum
physics	 and	 the	 whole	 postmodern	 approach	 in
philosophy	and	hermeneutics.
The	 famous	 Husserlian	 slogan,	 Zu	 den	 Sachen
selbst!	 (To	 the	 things	 themselves)	 reflected
Husserl’s	goal,	to	intuit	the	essences	of	the	things
themselves.	Although	not	many	philosophers	still
follow	his	methodology	for	that	purpose	today,	Zu
den	 Sachen	 selbst!	 could	 be	 taken	 as	 a	 slogan	 to
admonish	 us	 to	 concentrate	 on	 treatment	 of	 the
whole	 patient,	 examining	 and	 describing	 the
whole	 of	 the	 phenomena	 the	 patient	 presents,
including	the	phenomena	of	our	interaction	with
the	patient	as	we	experience	it.	This	is	the	patient.
In	
Husserl’s	
terminology,	
the	
act	
of
experiencing	 contains	 two	 phases.	 The	 first	 of
these	is	noesis	or	the	noetic	phase,	in	which	sense
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1013
data	are	constituted	as	meaningful	by	the	subject.
In	order	to	do	this,	a	second	or	noematic	phase	is
necessary,	in	which	the	“objects”	of	experience	are
constituted	by	the	intentionality	of	the	experience.
Such	 “objects,”	 invested	 with	 the	 subject’s
meaning	 and	 emotions,	 are	 called	 noemata	 (a
single	 such	 “object”	 is	 called	 noema).	 Human
sciences	 must	 be	 built	 not	 on	 so-called	 natural
objects,	 which	 are	 abstractions	 from	 noemata	 in
which	 the	 intentional	 component	 is	 suspended,
but	on	the	noemata	themselves.	Otherwise	we	lose
the	vital	human	component	and	end	up	with	less
than	 the	 full	 experienced	 reality.	 We	 also	 must
know	 what	 kind	 of	 noematic	 world	 the	 person
constitutes	 around	 himself	 or	 herself	 that	 makes
his	or	her	choice	of	behavior	appropriate.
As	a	clinical	example,	Pao	(1979)	urged	us	to
consider	 the	 diagnosis	 of	 schizophrenia	 not	 so
much	on	the	basis	of	Bleuler’s	famous	criteria,	but
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1014
as	a	function	of	the	kind	of	ambience	the	therapist
experiences,	that	peculiar	sensation	of	relating	to
someone	who	is	both	there	and	not	there,	which
generates	 our	 considerable	 personal	 discomfort.
We	 might	 extend	 this	 further	 by	 employing
Kohut’s	
(1971)	
method	
of	
empathy	
(see
EMPATHY),	to	identify	the	self-experience	such	a
patient	 has	 by	 using	 trial	 identification,	 trying	 to
see	 how	 we	 feel	 if	 we	 can	 put	 ourselves	 in	 the
place	of	a	patient	who	has	to	relate	to	us	in	this
matter.	 Although	 Kohut’s	 method	 goes	 beyond
phenomenology,	one	cannot	help	but	focus	on	the
self-experience	 that	 is	 so	 central	 to	 Kohut’s
approach.
Phenomenologists	 ask,	 What	 self-conception
or	 self-image	 would	 make	 suicide	 seem	 like	 a
reasonable	 alternative	 for	 dealing	 with	 personal
problems?	How	can	we	make	sense	of	paranoia	as
a	way	of	being	in	the	world—what	experiences	led
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1015
the	person	to	constitute	the	objects	(noemala)	of
his	or	her	experience	in	this	manner?
A	 phenomenological	 approach	 to	 patients
commonly	 labeled	 borderline	 is,	 in	 my	 opinion,
more	 fruitful	 than	 a	 pejorative	 diagnosis,	 which
immediately	 shifts	 the	 interaction	 into	
an
adversarial	 mode.	 Atwood	 and	 Stolorow	 (1984)
have	
tried	
to	
apply	
their	
version	
of
“psychoanalytic	phenomenology”	to	this	condition.
R.	D.	Laing	(1960)	called	diagnosis	a	“political	act,”
referring	to	what	it	means	to	have	the	diagnostic
label	 of	 schizophrenia	 pinned	 on	 one—what	 it
means	to	the	world	of	the	patient	and	to	the	very
therapy	 itself.	 It	 is	 more	 useful	 therapeutically	 if
we	 try	 to	 articulate	 the	 phenomenology	 of	 the
experience	 with	 the	 patient	 and	 convey	 an
empathic	 understanding	 of	 it	 rather	 than	 try	 to
“scientifically”	 explain	 it	 by	 postulating	 and
interpreting,	 especially	 in	 the	 early	 phase	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1016
treatment.
Phenomenology	with	subsequent	hermeneutic
exegesis	hopefully	leads	to	better	recognition	for
patients	 as	 to	 how	 others	 may	 experience	 them
and	 how	 their	 difficulties	 in	 living	 come	 about
through	
the	
generation	
of	
maladaptive
interactional	phenomena.	It	also	removes	the	onus
of	 being	 diagnosed	 as	 having	 secret	 malevolent
representations	carried	about	in	one’s	psyche	like
some	sort	of	poison	that	threatens	to	contaminate
those	around	one.	It	allows	the	patient	to	preserve
self-esteem	during	the	investigation	rather	than	to
feel	 primitive	 and	 contemptible.	 It	 preserves	 the
humanity	 of	 the	 patient	 and	 the	 vital	 sense	 of
wholeness	 or	 autonomy	 of	 the	 self,	 even	 during
the	investigation.
Husserl,	Heidegger,	Sartre,	Merleau-Ponty,	and
such	 existential	 psychotherapists	 as	 Binswanger
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1017
and	
Boss	
use	
a	
different	
conception	
of
phenomenology,	as	do	modern	investigators	(see
Edie	1965,	1967,	1969).	They	share	very	little	in
common,	which,	along	with	much	obscure	writing,
accounts	for	some	of	the	confusion	in	the	field.	For
each	 investigator	 we	 must	 decide	 what	 is	 their
phenomenological	method	and	try	to	evaluate	the
method	 by	 the	 way	 the	 investigator	 actually
applies	it	and	by	what	information	it	provides	us
that	is	complementary	to	and	enhances	what	can
be	 obtained	 by	 the	 standard	 scientific	 approach.
Unfortunately,	 sometimes	 a	 maximum	 of	 jargon
conceals	a	minimum	of	information.

PHYSICIANLY	VOCATION
Stone	(1961)	is	convinced	that	the	nuances	of
the	 therapist’s	 attitude	 can	 determine	 the
difference	 between	 a	 lonely	 vacuum	 and	 a
controlled	 but	 warm	 and	 human	 situation.	 He
defines	 physicianly	 vocation	 as	 a	 kindly	 and
helpful,	 broadly	 tolerant,	 and	 friendly	 interest	 in
one’s	
patients.	
Physicianly	
vocation	
is	
a
manifestation	 of	 maturity	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the
therapist,	 of	 his	 or	 her	 sense	 of	 identity,	 of	 a
lifelong	vocation,	of	the	capacity	for	a	commitment
and	a	real	relationship	to	another	individual.	It	is
not	 role	 playing.	 If	 there	 are	 excessively	 severe
deficits	 in	 human	 response	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the
therapist,	 human	 responses	 that	 the	 patient	 may
reasonably	expect	or	require,	there	are	going	to	be
very	 serious	 transference	 distortions	 and	 the
therapy	 will	 flounder.	 Greenson	 (1968)	 echoes
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1021
this	thought,	when	he	writes:	“The	patient	will	be
influenced	not	only	by	the	content	of	our	work	but
by	 how	 we	 work,	 the	 attitude,	 the	 manner,	 the
mood,	the	atmosphere	in	which	we	work”	(p.	212).
The	 ambience	 we	 offer	 greatly	 affects	 the
patient	whether	we	like	it	or	not.	The	patient	may
react	to	and	identify	with	precisely	those	aspects
of	us	that	are	not	necessarily	conscious	to	us.	For
example,	if	a	patient’s	child	is	seriously	ill	and	she
comes	 in	 crying	 and	 worrying	 about	 it,	 and	 the
therapist	insists	on	continuing	without	discussing
the	matter	at	all	and	shows	no	concern,	this	will
have	a	profound	effect	because	it	represents	a	lack
of	 normal	 human	 response.	 It	 will	 insure	 a
deleterious	 and	 destructive	 reaction	 sooner	 or
later	in	the	therapy	situation.
Baudry	 (1991)	 identifies	 the	 analyst’s	 beliefs
and	 attitudes,	 personal	 style,	 and	 characteristic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1022
reactions	 as	 crucial	 components	 of	 his	 or	 her
technique.	 He	 defines	 the	 analyst’s	 character	 as
“the	 complex	 organization	 of	 stable	 recurrent
traits,	behaviors,	and	attitudes	which	define	him”
(p.	918).	A	derivative	of	this	is	the	analyst’s	style,
which	denotes	the	“behavioral	components	of	the
analyst’s	 professional	 identity”	 (p.	 919).	 Patients
are	 intimidated	 by	 aspects	 of	 our	 style	 and
behavior,	 “which	 they	 sense	 is	 invested	 with	 a
certain	sense	of	pride	and	is	not	open	to	question;
this	is	often	conveyed	in	nonverbal	ways”	(p.	926).
The	sicker	and	more	repressed	patients	are	most
influenced	 by	 these	 factors,	 and	 they	 show	 up
especially	when	it	is	not	clear	how	to	proceed,	for
example	
in	
the	
introduction	
of	
so-called
parameters	 (see	 PARAMETER).	 Certain	 character
traits	 are	 designed	 to	 evoke	 particular	 types	 of
responses	in	others	in	order	to	actualize	a	wished-
for	 relationship	 existing	 in	 fantasy.	 These	 styles
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1023
and	character	traits	of	the	analyst	have	a	profound
effect	 in	 determining	 the	 analyst’s	 day-to-day
clinical	 decisions	 and	 interventions	 and	 in
facilitating	or	stalemating	the	treatment,	as	well	as
in	
influencing	
consequent	
transference-
countertransference	interactions.
As	 the	 scope	 of	 psychoanalytic	 treatment	 has
expanded,	 we	 see	 a	 variety	 of	 transference-
countertransference	 interactions	 that	 can	 no
longer	be	accounted	for	by	simply	postulating	the
revival	 of	 oedipal	 wishes	 now	 aimed	 across	 the
repression	 barrier	 at	 the	 representation	 of	 the
analyst.	 In	 patients	 with	 substantial	 preoedipal
damage,	 more	 archaic	 phenomena	 manifest
themselves,	thought	by	some	to	be	an	indication	of
an	 ego	 deficit	 and	 by	 others	 to	 be	 the	 result	 of
intrapsychic	 conflict	 and	 compromise	 formation.
These	 archaic	 phenomena	 pose	 an	 immediate
challenge	to	the	character	and	style	of	the	analyst.

order	 to	 maintain	 that	 privilege	 and	 control	 in
their	relationships	with	others.	Because	of	this,	the
lack	 of	 human	 response	 profoundly	 affects	 the
course	 of	 the	 treatment	 and	 often	 results	 in
treatment	failure,	stalemate,	or	massive	acting	out
by	 the	 patient	 alone	 or	 by	 the	 patient	 together
with	the	psychotherapist.

The	 best	 example	 of	 the	 proper	 human
response	to	patients	is	provided	by	Freud	himself
in	some	of	his	case	histories.	For	example,	Lipton
(1977,	 1979)	 discusses	 Freud’s	 behavior	 and
stance	 to	 Paul	 Lorenz,	 as	 described	 in	 Freud’s
(1909)	case	history	of	an	obsessional	neurosis.
The	lack	of	a	physicianly	vocation	is	one	of	the
most	common	and	serious	reasons	for	the	failure
of	 intensive	 psychotherapy	 and	 psychoanalysis.
The	most	valuable	contribution	of	the	psychology
of	 the	 self	 (see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY)	 has	 been	 to
focus	on	the	physicianly	vocation	and	the	empathy
it	 implies	 as	 an	 important	 healing	 element	 in
psychoanalytic	and	psychotherapeutic	treatment.

(see	REPRESSION)
PRIMAL	SCENE
The	term	primal	scene	is	used	ambiguously	in
the	psychoanalytic	literature.	At	times	it	refers	to
the	
child’s	
actual	
observation	
of	
parental
intercourse.	 More	 accurately,	 it	 refers	 to	 the
child’s	
conception	
of	
the	
parents	
having
intercourse,	
a	
combination	
of	
reality	
and
important	 fantasy.	 The	 resulting	 conception	 is	 a
compromise	 formation	 formed	 by	 the	 immature
ego	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 id,	 superego,	 and	 external
world.
The	 child’s	 fantasies	 or	 recollections	 of
parental	intercourse	woven	together	often	contain
a	
sadomasochistic	
component.	
It	
is	
often
impossible	
to	
determine	
in	
psychoanalysis
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1029
whether	the	patient	as	a	child	actually	witnessed
parental	 intercourse	 or	 whether	 much	 of	 the
material	 around	 the	 primal	 scene	 represents	 the
child’s	 primitive	 conception	 of	 what	 parental
intercourse	 is	 like.	 This	 makes	 very	 little
difference	as	far	as	the	great	importance	of	primal
scene	 material	 in	 determining	 the	 patient’s
relationships	 with	 people	 and	 sexual	 activity	 is
concerned.	 Psychic	 reality	 is	 what	 counts	 in	 the
unconscious,	 and,	 as	 Arlow	 (1985)	 explains,
“Patients	
whose	
free	
associations,
symptomatology,	 and	 life	 history	 clearly	 reflect
the	 effects	 of	 a	 primal	 scene	 experience	 rarely
recover	the	memory	of	the	event”	(p.	533).
Whether	or	not	primal	scene	material	will	be
traumatic	for	the	child	usually	depends	less	on	the
nature	 of	 what	 has	 been	 observed	 than	 on	 the
child’s	basic	relationship	with	the	parents.	One	can
generalize	that	when	primal	scene	material	seems
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1030
to	 have	 been	 very	 traumatic	 for	 the	 child,	 there
was	
probably	
a	
basic	
difficulty	
in	
those
relationships.	 Further	 evidence	 for	 this	 is	 in	 the
fact	 that	 in	 many	 societies	 where	 children
frequently	
and	
openly	
witness	
parental
intercourse	 there	 are	 no	 observable	 consistent
psychopathological	
effects.	
Arlow	
(1985)
concludes,	 “What	 constitutes	 trauma	 is	 not
inherent	in	the	actual,	real	event,	but	rather	in	the
individual’s	
response	
to	
the	
disorganizing,
disruptive	 combination	 of	 impulses	 and	 fears
integrated	into	a	set	of	unconscious	fantasies”	(p.
533).

PRIMARY	IDENTIFICATION
Freud	 (1917)	 described	 this	 as	 a	 form	 of
internalization	that	occurs	before	one	can	speak	of
object	 loss	 because	 it	 takes	 place	 prior	 to	 the
infant’s	clear	differentiation	between	the	self	and
the	object.	It	is	an	immediate	and	direct	early	form
of	internalization.	Primary	identification	must	be
distinguished	 from	 later	 forms	 of	 incorporation,
identification,	 or	 introjection,	 all	 of	 which
postulate	the	capacity	to	distinguish	between	the
internal	
and	
the	
external	
world	
(see
IDENTIFICATION,	
INTROJECTION,
INCORPORATION).	 Some	 authors	 refer	 to	 the
latter	as	secondary	internalizations.
According	 to	 LaPlanche	 and	 Pontalis	 (1973),
Freud	does	not	use	the	term	very	often,	but	when
he	 does,	 he	 (1921,	 1923)	 means	 it	 as	 a	 boy’s
identification	with	the	father.	Freud	considers	this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1032
a	 direct	 and	 immediate	 identification	 that	 takes
place	 earlier	 than	 any	 love-object	 cathexis.	 But
other	 authors	 use	 the	 term	 to	 represent	 the
infant’s	bond	to	the	mother,	the	first	relationship
before	the	differentiation	between	the	ego	and	the
external	 world	 has	 been	 firmly	 established.	 It	 is
still	 thought	 of,	 as	 Freud	 (1921)	 says,	 as	 “the
original	form	of	emotional	tie	with	an	object”	(p.
107).	 Although	 it	 is	 not	 an	 easy	 concept	 to
articulate,	it	is	clear	that	primary	identification	is
extremely	important.	It	has	to	do	with	the	infant’s
feeling	 of	 fusion	 or	 oneness	 with	 the	 mother
before	 it	 has	 discovered	 that	 others	 and	 objects
are	separate	from	it.
In	preoedipal	cases,	where	there	is	a	primary
identification	with	a	pathological	mother,	extreme
difficulties	arise	in	achieving	the	very	basic	skills
of	 adaptation.	 These	 “apraxias,”	 as	 Gedo	 (1988)
calls	 them,	 may	 be	 global	 or	 specific	 in	 nature,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1033
depending	 on	 the	 pathology	 of	 the	 mother	 (see
BEYOND	INTERPRETATION).
In	 an	 early	 discussion	 of	 the	 management	 of
archaic	transferences	Gedo	(1981)	writes	as	a	case
example,	“I	persisted,	in	spite	of	the	lengthy	rages
provoked	 by	 this	 policy,	 in	 consistently	 pointing
out	the	disavowed	magical	ideation	at	the	root	of
the	patient’s	behavior,	including	the	enactments	in
the	analytic	situation.	Only	the	cognitive	grasp	of
the	actualities	of	her	performances	permitted	the
patient	 to	 gain	 insight	 into	 their	 sources	 in	 the
identification	with	her	mother”	(p.	113).	As	Gedo
explains,	somewhere	around	18	months	of	age,	the
prevalence	 of	 the	 magical	 ideation	 in	 the	 patient
“will	be	decisively	influenced	by	the	quality	of	the
familial	matrix.”	He	continues,	“I	think	it	is	entirely
likely	 that	 grandiose	 fantasies	 may	 not	 be
‘endogenous’	 at	 all	 but	 are	 entirely	 learned”	 (p.
112).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1034
The	 appearance	 of	 archaic	 demands,	 says
Gedo,	 are	 compensatory	 efforts	 to	 patch	 over
developmental	 deficits,	 skills	 that	 the	 patient
lacks.	 He	 calls	 these	 deficits	 an	 accumulation	 of
functional	
handicaps	
produced	
by	
early
developmental	vicissitudes.	Gedo	(1981)	believes
that	 “in	 such	 cases,	 psychoanalysis	 must	 be
attempted	 to	 correct	 the	 structuralization	 of
maladaptive	patterns”	(p.	57),	a	kind	of	repair	job
applied	 to	 the	 early	 background	 practices	 that
constitute	
the	
fore-understanding	
of	
the
individual.
Gedo	 goes	 so	 far	 as	 to	 insist	 that	 selfobject
needs,	claimed	by	Kohut	to	be	present	throughout
life,	 “may	 well	 disappear	 if	 patients	 succeed	 in
mastering	 psychological	 skills	 they	 failed	 to
acquire	 in	 childhood”	 (p.	 175),	 a	 contention	 that
places	him	in	direct	opposition	to	Kohut’s	theories.
For	 Gedo,	 the	 selfobject	 transferences	 described
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1035
by	 Kohut	 really	 represent	 an	 attempt	 to	 mask
inadequacies	at	presymbolic	levels	of	functioning
through	 the	 adaptive	 use	 of	 external	 assistance.
Thus,	 for	 Gedo,	 “Everyone	 to	 a	 large	 extent
determines	his	own	unfavorable	destiny”	(p.	30),
and	 rationalizations	 cover	 the	 self-restrictive	 or
selfdamaging	enactments	“that	could	be	stopped	if
only	patients	recognized	that	options	are	open	to
them”	(p.	30).
In	a	clinically	valuable	comment,	Gedo	points
out	that	people	with	overwhelming	psychological
deficits	can	reach	adulthood	and	adapt	adequately
by	learning	to	imitate	the	behavior	of	other	adults,
“although	 they	 usually	 feel	 imposturous	 and
fraudulent	 while	 doing	 so”	 (p.	 61).	 Or	 they	 may
adapt	 through	 a	 symbiosis	 to	 a	 selfobject;	 even
their	 use	 of	 the	 couch	 is	 primarily	 for	 a	 holding
experience.	Interpretations	are	heard	as	soothing
proof	of	caring,	regardless	of	their	content,	which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1036
is	ignored	(Feinsilver	1983).
There	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 congruence	 between
Heidegger’s	 (1962)	 emphasis	 on	 background
practices,	 which	 cannot	 be	 fully	 articulated	 and
which	 form	 the	 grounding	 of	 all	 meaning	 and
experience,	
and	
Gedo’s	
attribution	
of
psychopathology	 to	 failures	 in	 the	 proper
inculcation	of	these	practices.	This	has	extremely
important	 ramifications	 for	 the	 practice	 of
intensive	 psychotherapy	 with	 borderline	 and
other	
preoedipally	
damaged	
patients.	
The
congruence	 of	 findings	 in	 these	 two	 separate
methods	 of	 investigation	 lend	 support	 to	 the
conclusions	of	each	and	form	a	fascinating	field	for
the	 future	 investigation	 of	 primary	 identification
and	its	consequences.

PRIMARY	LOVE
Balint	 (1952)	 defines	 primary	 love	 as	 object
love	 beginning	 in	 early	 infancy.	 He	 denies	 that
there	 is	 such	 a	 thing	 as	 primary	 narcissism	 and
argues	that	the	infant	reaches	out	with	object	love
for	 the	 mother	 from	 the	 beginning	 of	 life.	 Thus
narcissism	in	children	as	well	as	adults	would	all
be	of	a	secondary	nature,	because	it	involves	one’s
love	 for	 and	 gratification	 of	 one’s	 self.	 What	 is
basic	is	active	object	love,	a	primary	direct	love	for
the	mother—which	of	course	is	an	egoistic	way	of
loving	 originally	 and	 exclusively	 directed	 at	 the
mother.
Furthermore,	says	Balint,	maternal	love	is	the
instinctual	 counterpart	 of	 the	 infant’s	 primary
love.	Just	as	the	mother	is	to	the	child,	so	the	child
is	 to	 the	 mother	 an	 object	 of	 gratification.	 This
concept	 of	 primary	 love,	 an	 object	 love,	 and	 not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1039
narcissism	as	characterizing	the	beginning	of	life	is
a	 revolutionary	 reorientation	 from	 Freud’s	 basic
theories	(see	INSTINCT	and	OBJECT),	although	in
his	 later	 work	 (Greenberg	 and	 Mitchell	 1983)
Freud	seems	to	have	shifted	toward	the	notion	of
primary	object	relatedness	occurring	very	early	in
life.

PRINCIPLE	OF	CONSTANCY
(see	also	NIRVANA	PRINCIPLE)
The	principle	of	constancy	is	defined	by	Freud
(1920)	 as:	 “The	 mental	 apparatus	 endeavors	 to
keep	the	quantity	of	excitation	present	in	it	as	low
as	possible	or	at	least	to	keep	it	constant”	(p.	9).	A
common	 confusion	 tends	 to	 occur	 between
Freud’s	 notion	 of	 the	 pleasure	 principle	 and	 the
principle	of	constancy	(which	Freud	later	labeled
the	 Nirvana	 principle)	 since	 at	 the	 beginning
Freud	himself	assumed	that	these	two	principles
were	either	closely	correlated	or	identical.	This	is
one	of	those	subjects	on	which	Freud	changed	his
views	 several	 times;	 the	 appropriate	 references
for	his	various	viewpoints	are	given	in	“Instincts
and	Their	Vicissitudes”	(1915).
Since	conditions,	such	as	sexual	excitement,	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1041
which	there	is	a	state	of	increasing	tension	can	be
pleasurable,	 it	 seems	 clear	 that	 the	 principle	 of
constancy	 and	 the	 pleasure	 principle	 cannot	 be
identical.	 Freud’s	 final	 conclusion	 rests	 on	 the
suggestion	that	the	pleasurable	or	unpleasurable
quality	of	a	state	may	be	related	to	a	rhythm	of	the
changes	 in	 the	 quantity	 of	 excitation	 present.	 In
“Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle”	(1920)	he	regards
the	 pleasure	 principle	 as	 a	 modification	 of	 the
principle	of	constancy	(the	Nirvana	principle).	In
his	 final	 speculation	 he	 maintains	 that	 the
principle	 of	 constancy	 comes	 from	 the	 death
instinct,	 and	 its	 modification	 into	 the	 pleasure
principle	is	due	to	the	influence	of	the	life	instinct
(see	
DEATH	
INSTINCT).	
The	
principle	
of
constancy	 has	 been	 largely	 discredited	 by	 recent
research	 on	 the	 physiology	 of	 the	 brain,	 the
psychological	 functioning	 of	 infants,	 and	 sensory
deprivation	experiments	(Lichtenberg	1983).

PROJECTION,
PROJECTIVE	IDENTIFICATION
The	 infant	 has	 little	 in	 the	 way	 of	 a	 barrier
against	the	internal	impulses	of	its	id.	One	of	the
ways	it	can	deal	with	these	primitive	impulses	is
to	 perceive	 them	 as	 coming	 from	 outside	 itself.
This	 early	 and	 primitive	 attempt	 to	 deal	 with
unacceptable	discomfort	evolves	into	the	defense
mechanism	of	projection.
In	projection	one’s	own	ideas	or	impulses	are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1043
cast	 upon	 another.	 When	 used	 to	 an	 extreme,
projection	interferes	with	reality	testing.	It	is	the
predominant	mechanism	in	patients	with	paranoia
(see	 PARANOIA).	 Freud	 (1911)	 described	 it	 in
connection	
with	
Schreber’s	
delusions	
of
persecution,	 the	 result	 of	 denial,	 projection,	 and
reversal.
Klein	 (1975)	 developed	 the	 concept	 of
projective	 identification,	 which	 has	 been	 defined
differently	by	different	authors	and	has	given	rise
to	 a	 vast	 literature.	 For	 Klein,	 projective
identification	 had	 two	 aspects,	 one	 intrapsychic
and	 the	 other	 interpersonal.	 First,	 projective
identification	 is	 characterized	 by	 a	 forceful,
aggressive	 evacuation	 in	 fantasy,	 consisting	 of	 a
penetration	into	the	object	and	a	reinternalization
of	the	object	that	was	injured,	which	may	lead	to
depression,	or	a	reinternalization	of	the	object	that
was	 rendered	 hostile,	 which	 may	 lead	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1044
persecutory	 hypochondria.	 It	 also	 represents	 a
very	primitive	means	of	communication,	and	leads
to	 “beyond	 the	 countertransference”	 distress	 in
the	therapist	and	to	interpersonal	interaction.	So
Klein	 inconsistently	 conceived	 of	 projective
identification	 both	 as	 a	 fantasy	 and	 as	 an
interpersonal	
relationship,	
an	
interactional
process.
Kernberg	(1975,	1976,	1980)	views	projective
identification	 as	 solely	 intrapsychic;	 for	 him,	 it
represents	an	incomplete	projection.	He	presents
three	
case	
illustrations	
of	
projection	
and
projective	identification	that	are	worthy	of	serious
study	(Kernberg	1987).	In	projection	there	is	first
the	 repressing	 of	 the	 intolerable,	 then	 the
projecting	 of	 it	 onto	 the	 object,	 and	 finally	 the
“separating	 or	 distancing	 [of]	 oneself	 from	 the
object	to	fortify	the	defensive	effort”	(p.	796).	In
projective	identification,	which	Kernberg	views	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1045
more	primitive,	there	is	a	similar	projection	of	the
intolerable	 onto	 the	 object,	 but	 the	 patient
maintains	 a	 relationship	 with	 the	 object,	 now
experienced	as	what	has	been	projected,	and	“tries
to	 control	 the	 object	 in	 a	 continuing	 effort	 to
defend	 against	 the	 intolerable	 experience,	 and,
unconsciously,	 in	 an	 actual	 interaction	 with	 the
object,	 leads	 the	 object	 to	 experience	 what	 has
been	projected	onto	him”	(p.	796).
At	 the	 basis	 of	 projective	 identification,
patients	 are	 thought	 to	 place	 into	 the	 analyst
whatever	self	or	object	representations	they	wish
to	place	there,	a	view	leading	to	more	therapeutic
focus	 on	 preoedipal	 fantasies	 and	 processes.	 A
study	of	projective	identification	operating	in	the
therapeutic	 process	 emphasizes	 the	 patient’s
earliest	 internalized	 object	 relations	 and	 yields
data	 on	 how	 the	 patient	 as	 an	 infant	 organized
these	relations	into	self	and	object	representations
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1046
and	 then	 projected	 and	 reintrojected	 various
aspects	 of	 these	 images.	 Understanding	 these
processes	 clarifies	 the	 patient’s	 relationships	 in
the	 present	 because	 all	 such	 relationships	 are
perceived	and	reacted	to	through	the	spectacles	of
these	
early	
organized	
self	
and	
object
representations	(see	Ogden	1979).
The	assumption	here	is	that	the	infantile	ego	is
capable	 of	 such	 organization;	 recent	 research	 on
infants	(Stern	1985)	suggests	that	this	is	unlikely.
Empirical	investigation	of	infants	carries	the	hope
that,	as	we	come	to	understand	the	capacities	and
limitations	of	the	mind	of	the	infant	and	child,	we
will	 have	 better	 criteria	 on	 which	 to	 choose	 or
reject	psychoanalytic	models	(Lichtenberg	1983).

PROJECTIVE	COUNTERIDENTIFICATION
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1048
When	
excessive	
projective	
identification
occurs	 (see	 PROJECTION),	 the	 psychotherapist
may	deal	with	it	in	several	ways.	He	or	she	may
immediately	and	equally	violently	reject	what	the
patient	 is	 attempting	 to	 project,	 may	 use	 other
personal	 defense	 mechanisms,	 may	 postpone	 or
displace	the	reaction	to	other	individuals,	or	may
counteridentify	with	the	projection.	As	described
by	Grinberg	(1962),	the	analyst	is	not	consciously
perceiving	 the	 projection	 but	 “may	 have	 the
feeling	 of	 being	 no	 longer	 his	 own	 self	 and	 of
unavoidably	becoming	transformed	into	the	object
which	 the	 patient,	 unconsciously,	 wanted	 him	 to

kinds	
of

described	as	then	behaving	“as	if	he	had	really	and

aspects	that	were	projected	on	to	him”	(p.	205).

PROTECTIVE	SHIELD
(REIZSCHUTZ)
Freud	 (1920)	 used	 the	 term	 Reizschutz,	 or
stimulus	barrier,	in	Beyond	the	Pleasure	Principle
to	 account	 for	 a	 protection	 of	 the	 infant	 against
external	excitation.	Freud	points	out	that	there	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1050
no	 similar	 protective	 shield	 within	 the	 infant
against	stimulation	coming	from	within.	One	way
of	 dealing	 with	 internal	 stimuli	 is	 to	 experience
them	 as	 coming	 from	 without	 the	 organism	 and
then	protect	one’s	self	by	the	use	of	the	protective
shield	(see	PROJECTION).	The	notion	of	Reizschutz
has	a	physiologic	implication	in	Freud’s	work,	but
it	seems	to	me	that	the	most	important	Reizschutz
for	 the	 infant,	 metaphorically	 speaking,	 is	 the
mother.
The	 mother	 has	 the	 function	 of	 intuitively
protecting	 the	 infant	 from	 excessive	 stimulation
from	 the	 external	 world.	 It	 is	 painful,	 tragic,	 and
excruciating	 to	 watch	 a	 situation	 in	 which	 the
mother	does	not	perform	this	function.	The	infant
is	 clearly	 overwhelmed	 by	 the	 external	 stimuli
and,	in	my	own	observations,	seems	to	put	itself
into	 a	 sort	 of	 stupor;	 I	 have	 even	 noticed	 this	 in
dogs	who	are	exposed	to	intense	stimuli.	I	think	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1051
a	 household	 where	 the	 infant	 is	 not	 properly
protected	against	external	stimuli	as,	for	example,
where	 there	 is	 marital	 skew	 and	 the	 father	 is
excessively	intense	and	even	overtly	physical	with
the	infant	and	the	mother	does	nothing	to	prevent
it,	the	chronic	exposure	to	overwhelming	stimuli
damages	 the	 infant’s	 psychic	 apparatus.	 In	 other
households	the	infant	is	exposed	and	unprotected
from	the	continual	quarreling	among	siblings	and
parents,	and	the	blaring	of	a	TV	set	that	is	on	at
high	volume	for	much	of	the	day	and	night.
I	believe	this	may	well	account	for	some	of	the
difficulty	that	underprivileged	children	in	the	third
world	 or	 in	 the	 United	 States	 have	 with
socialization	and	learning	when	they	reach	school
age.	These	children	have	taught	themselves	to	live
in	a	chronic	stupor	or	perhaps	even	in	an	autistic
world,	and	they	emerge	from	this	stupor	only	with
excessive	pressure,	all	too	quickly	returning	to	it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1052
when	the	pressure	is	relieved.	I	believe	that	these
children	 enter	 school	 already	 with	 a	 serious
handicap	 because	 the	 mother	 has	 not	 performed
an	 important	 protective	 function	 for	 them.	 The
notion	 of	 Reizschutz	 deserves	 more	 attention	 in
the	current	literature.

PSEUDOHOMOSEXUALITY
Ovesey	
(1969)	
attempts	
to	
distinguish
between	
homosexuality	
and
pseudohomosexuality.	 He	 argues	 that	 anxiety
about	 homosexuality	 has	 three	 motivational
components:	
sexual	
(seeking	
homosexual
gratification),	 dependency,	 and	 power.	 Anxiety
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1053
about	 dependency	 and	 power-striving	 when
expressed	 sexually	 are	 defined	 by	 Ovesey	 as
pseudohomosexual.	
The	
psychodynamics	
of
paranoia	 as	 described	 by	 Freud	 (1911)	 can	 be
applied	 to	 either	 deep	 latent	 homosexual	 or
pseudohomosexual	 strivings,	 since	 as	 far	 as	 the
patient	 is	 concerned,	 all	 are	 experienced	 in	 the
same	way	(see	PARANOIA).
Ovesey’s	views	have	great	clinical	importance.
He	explains,	“The	desire	for	dependency	through
the	paternal	love	of	a	father-substitute	is	the	most
superficial	 form	 of	 the	 dependency	 fantasy.	 The
same	 fantasy	 on	 a	 deeper	 unconscious	 level	 is
integrated	in	a	more	primitive	fashion	through	the
equation	breast	—	penis.	The	patient	who	resorts
to	
this	
equation	
attempts	
to	
gratify	
his
dependency	 needs	 through	 the	 oral	 or	 anal
incorporation	 of	 the	 stronger	 man’s	 penis”	 (pp.
62-63).	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 “The	 power-driven
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1054
male	 tries	 to	 dissipate	 his	 weakness	 in	 a
compensatory	fashion	through	a	show	of	strength,
and	 to	 this	 end	 he	 is	 continuously	 engaged	 in
competition	 with	 other	 men.	 There	 is	 no
discrimination	about	this	competition;	it	is	about
anything	 and	 everything.	 Unfortunately,	 his
conviction	 of	 inadequacy	 is	 so	 strong	 that	 he
concedes	defeat	in	advance.	The	result	is	a	chronic
pseudohomosexual	anxiety”	(pp.	57-58).
Ovesey’s	main	contribution	has	been	to	point
out	 that	 the	 patient	 can	 misinterpret	 his
frightening	 power	 and	 dependency	 strivings	 as
feminine,	 or	 conceive	 of	 them	 in	 homosexual
terms.	 This	 leads	 to	 anxiety	 about	 being	 a
homosexual	 (pseudohomosexual	 anxiety),	 which
can	then	lead	to	paranoid	defenses.	The	question
of	 why	 the	 patient	 chooses	 genital	 expression	 of
his	 power	 and	 dependency	 strivings	 remains
unanswered	in	Ovesey’s	formulation.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1055
The	critical	question	that	each	psychotherapy
must	 answer	 is	 whether,	 given	 a	 case	 of
developing	paranoia,	this	is	based	on	an	outburst
of	homosexual	libido	or	on	power	or	dependency
problems	 appearing	 in	 the	 patient’s	 mind	 in	 a
genitalized	or	sexualized	homosexual	form.	There
simply	 is	 no	 agreement	 on	 this	 subject	 at	 the
present	 time.	 My	 clinical	 experience	 is	 that	 in
cases	 of	 paranoia	 one	 can	 always	 trace	 this
development	to	the	longing	for	the	love	of	a	man,
in	the	case	of	males—and	less	easily,	in	the	case	of
females,	 to	 the	 longing	 for	 a	 female.	 Although
Ovesey	argues	that	the	pseudohomosexual	conflict
develops	 in	 men	 who	 fail	 to	 meet	 successfully
society’s	 standard	 of	 masculine	 performance
because	of	an	inhibition	of	assertion,	I	am	inclined
to	 agree	 with	 Freud	 (1911),	 especially	 with
respect	to	men,	that	“what	lies	at	the	core	of	the
conflict	 in	 cases	 of	 paranoia	 among	 males	 is	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1056
homosexual	 wishful	 fantasy	 of	 loving	 a	 man”	 (p.
62).

PSYCHIC	DETERMINISM
This	is	one	of	the	most	difficult,	controversial,
and	 philosophical	 issues	 embedded	 in	 Freud’s
psychoanalytic	system.	It	holds	that	every	mental
phenomenon	 and	 all	 current	 psychic	 acts	 and
events	 are	 the	 result	 of	 previous	 forces	 at	 play
within	 the	 psyche	 (see	 MULTIPLE	 FUNCTION).
This	 apparently	 plunges	 Freud	 directly	 into	 the
age-old	 disputed	 philosophical	 issue	 of	 free	 will
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1057
versus	
determinism.	
Indeed,	
Freud’s	
work
constitutes	 a	 philosophical	 system.	 He	 never
wavered	in	his	attitude	of	belief	in	a	regular	chain
of	 mental	 events,	 including	 the	 thoroughgoing
meaningfulness	 and	 determinism	 of	 even	 the
apparently	 most	 obscure	 and	 arbitrary	 mental
phenomenon.	His	view	on	the	subject	of	free	will
was	 that	 apparently	 free	 choices	 are	 decided	 by
our	unconscious	but	we	claim	conscious	credit	for
the	
outcome;	
therefore,	
when	
unconscious
motivation	 is	 taken	 into	 account,	 the	 rule	 of
determinism	still	holds.
Freud’s	version	of	determinism	is	retroactive;
that	is	to	say,	he	believed	that	given	any	psychic
event	or	process	one	can	work	backwards	in	the
chain	of	free	associations	and	find	previous	events
that	 led	 to	 the	 current	 event.	 The	 opposite
procedure	 is	 not	 implied,	 however;	 namely,	 that
given	 a	 knowledge	 of	 all	 the	 current	 psychic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1058
forces,	 one	 can	 predict	 what	 the	 outcome	 of	 the
interaction	 of	 these	 forces	 will	 be.	 This	 is	 an
important	 distinction	 philosophically	 speaking,
and	it	fortunately	places	Freud	outside	of	the	issue
of	 pure	 free	 will	 versus	 pure	 determinism;	 he	 is
not	 a	 “hard	 determinist”	 in	 philosophy.	 His
interest	was	solely	in	working	backwards,	not	in
predicting	the	future.
The	 great	 value	 of	 Freud’s	 approach	 shows
itself	when	we	use	the	method	of	free	association.
By	 patient	 listening	 we	 discover	 that	 the	 most
apparently	 disconnected	 thoughts	 and	 fantasies
turn	 out	 eventually	 to	 have	 a	 major	 unconscious
connecting	 determinant.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 Freud’s
most	dramatic	and	valuable	discoveries.
PSYCHOANALYSIS
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1059
Psychoanalysis	is	in	some	ways	very	simple	to
define	 and	 in	 other	 ways	 very	 difficult.	 All
psychoanalytic	models	have	the	same	conceptual
base,	the	dynamic	unconscious,	although	they	may
differ	 in	 certain	 fundamental	 ways.	 All	 deal	 with
transference	and	countertransference	and	use	the
method	of	free	association.	All	view	infantile	and
childhood	 experiences	 as	 crucial	 and	 stress
preoedipal	 and	 oedipal	 factors	 to	 one	 degree	 or
another.	 All	 in	 various	 ways	 and	 to	 different
degrees	 emphasize	 repetition,	 the	 role	 of	 the
analyst,	 and	 the	 importance	 of	 interpretation.
Although	
one	
neglects	
Freud’s
drive/conflict/defense	 orientation	 at	 one’s	 peril,
many	“alternative”	approaches	have	been	devised
over	the	years	to	avoid	both	Freud’s	emphasis	on
sexuality	 and	 aggression	 as	 constituting	 the
infantile	core	of	the	adult	and	his	central	focus	on
the	Oedipus	complex.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1060
Psychoanalysis	 is	 thought	 by	 some	 to	 be	 a
branch	 of	 natural	 science	 as	 Freud	 described	 it
and	by	others	to	be	a	form	of	hermeneutics.	Leavy
(1980)	 attempts	 to	 move	 psychoanalysis	 in	 the
direction	of	hermeneutics	and	argues	against	it	as
a	natural	science.	His	argument	rests	on	the	fact,
as	 he	 sees	 it,	 that	 there	 are	 no	 objective	 data	 in
psychoanalysis	 with	 which	 we	 can	 put	 nature	 to
question.	Others	would	disagree	with	this,	arguing
that	 the	 transference	 constitutes	 the	 most
important	objective	data	of	psychoanalysis.
Leavy	 is	 influenced	 by	 Lacan,	 who	 views
transference	 as	 a	 misrecognition	 of	 the	 other	 in
the	 dialogue	 based	 on	 desire	 (see	 LACAN).	 For
Lacan	 (1978),	 the	 purpose	 of	 the	 psychoanalytic
dialogue	is	to	achieve	greater	self-knowledge,	that
is,	 knowledge	 of	 one’s	 desire,	 not	 the	 lifting	 of
repression	or	the	releasing	of	energy	for	the	use	of
the	ego.	Psychoanalysts	who	view	psychoanalysis
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1061
as	 a	 natural	 science	 and/or	 are	 members	 of	 the
ego	 psychology	 school	 would	 strongly	 disagree
with	this.
For	 Leavy	 and	 Lacan,	 interpretation	 begins
with	 marveling	 at	 tropes.	 Metaphor	 leads	 to	 the
discovery	 of	 latent	 structure,	 the	 message,	 and
desires.	 So	 in	 the	 therapeutic	 process	 we	 move
from	 utterances	 to	 images	 to	 preverbal	 wants.
Unconscious	 fantasies,	 for	 Leavy	 and	 Lacan,
represent	 a	 signified	 desire	 that	 we	 reach	 via
language.	 For	 hermeneuticists,	 repression	 is	 a
linguistic	
transformation	
and	
psychoanalytic
validity	is	a	function	of	the	coherence	of	memories.
For	 Leavy	 and	 Lacan,	 this	 cuts	 psychoanalysis
loose	 from	 objective	 reality	 and	 science	 and
focuses	only	on	the	dialogue	(see	DIALOGUE).	This
means	 that	 for	 Leavy,	 as	 for	 Spence	 (1982),	 we
have	only	narrative	truths	in	psychoanalysis.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1062
The	standard	view,	on	the	contrary,	envisions
psychoanalysis	 as	 a	 natural	 science,	 a	 method	 of
investigating	the	mind,	and	a	modality	of	therapy
for	psychopathology.	But	arguments	remain	as	to
what	 are	 the	 essentials	 of	 a	 psychoanalytic
treatment.	 A	 traditional	 view	 holds	 that	 the
external	 trappings	 of	 the	 treatment	 (e.g.,	 very
frequent	 sessions	 and	 the	 use	 of	 the	 couch)	 are
vital	to	the	definition,	while	an	opposing	extreme
view	 maintains	 that	 psychoanalysis	 is	 whatever
psychiatric	
treatment	
is	
practiced	
by
psychoanalysts.	 A	 middle	 view	 might	 be	 that
psychoanalysis	 takes	 place	 when	 there	 is	 a
sufficient	 regression	 in	 the	 service	 of	 the	 ego	 so
that	a	stable	and	interpretable	transference	forms.
The	interpretation	of	this	transference,	along	with
the	 patient’s	 actual	 experience	 of	 the	 interaction
with	the	therapist	(i.e.,	a	new	object	relation;	see
Loewald	1980),	is	the	crucial	curative	factor	in	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1063
treatment.
For	the	self	psychologists,	the	important	aspect
of	the	relationship	with	the	therapist	is	empathy,
and	what	is	interpreted	are	the	patient’s	reactions
to	 perceived	 disturbances	 in	 the	 therapist’s
empathy.	 For	 traditional	 psychoanalysts,	 what	 is
interpreted	is	a	transference	in	which	instinctual
desires	 cross	 the	 repression	 barrier	 and	 are
attached	to	the	representation	of	the	analyst.	It	is
true	 that	 the	 use	 of	 the	 couch	 and	 very	 frequent
sessions	tend	to	facilitate	regression	in	the	service
of	the	ego,	but	such	regression	and	the	formation
of	 an	 interpretable	 transference	 can	 occasionally
occur	even	in	a	less	frequent	treatment.
What	makes	the	procedure	a	psychoanalysis	is
when	
the	
transference	
is	
given	
a	
total
interpretation.	That	is	to	say,	the	current	situation
and	 the	 patient’s	 perception	 of	 it	 are	 tied
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1064
convincingly	 to	 the	 patient’s	 childhood	 situation
and	 his	 or	 her	 perception	 of	 that.	 This	 latter
perception	usually	takes	the	form	of	compromise
formations,	 which	 are	 essentially	 early	 psychic
fantasies	that	become	reenacted	or	reexperienced
in	 the	 transference.	 When	 there	 is	 a	 consistent
formation	 and	 interpretation	 of	 a	 significant
transference	 this	 interpretive	 work,	 if	 properly
carried	 out,	 should	 lead	 into	 the	 depths	 of	 the
patient’s	personality	and	developmental	stages	so
that,	layer	by	layer,	one	eventually	reaches	in	an
orderly	 fashion	 the	 core	 unresolved	 psychic
conflict.
My	 position	 is	 that	 empathy	 with	 the	 patient
that	allows	the	selfobject	transferences	to	arise	is
a	 vital	 way	 of	 beginning	 the	 treatment	 (see
EMPATHY).	Along	with	the	physicianly	vocation	of
the	
analyst	
(see	
PHYSICIANLY	
VOCATION),
empathy	sets	up	an	ambience	that	is	optimal	for
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1065
the	 integration	 of	 interpretations	 and	 for	 the
development	 of	 a	 new	 object	 relationship.	 This
object	relationship,	as	it	arises	out	of	the	proper
ambience	of	the	treatment,	continuously	provides
the	motivation	for	the	patient	to	develop,	whether
one	wishes	to	view	it	with	Freud	as	love	for	the
analyst	
or	
with	
Loewald	
(1960)	
as	
a
developmental	reaching	out	toward	higher	levels
of	integration.
The	setting	of	the	analytic	treatment	with	the
patient	on	the	couch	and	doing	most	of	the	talking
promotes	regression.	The	rule	of	abstinence	(see
ABSTINENCE),	 properly	 applied,	 promotes	 the
resurgence	 of	 yearnings	 for	 old	 objects,	 the
appearance	of	fantasy	activity,	and	the	subsequent
development	of	the	transference.	If	the	patient	is
excessively	 gratified,	 the	 transference	 does	 not
appear,	 but	 if	 the	 patient	 is	 irrationally	 or
sadistically	 ungratified	 in	 the	 treatment,	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1066
reaction	will	be	one	of	iatrogenic	narcissism	and
rage,	
which	
cannot	
properly	
be	
called
transference.	
Everything	
depends	
on	
the
maturation,	 skill,	 and	 clinical	 judgment	 of	 the
analyst.
The	 interpretation	 of	 the	 transference	 and	 of
extratransference	
situations	
should	
aim	
at
focusing	on	the	central	core	of	the	patient	through
the	continuous	analysis	of	derivatives	of	that	core.
The	patient’s	observing	ego	must	engage	with	the
analyst	and	eventually	take	over	the	search	for	the
crucial	 infantile	 fantasies	 and/or	 traumata	 and
identify	 them.	 However,	 as	 Arlow	 (1985)	 points
out,	events	such	as	the	primal	scene	(see	PRIMAL
SCENE)	 are	 rarely	 directly	 remembered.	 What
counts	 as	 the	 patient’s	 psychic	 reality	 is	 a	 basic
core	of	fantasies	or	traumata	in	some	combination
of	 intensity,	 woven	 into	 a	 unique	 special	 fantasy
activity;	 in	 some	 patients	 the	 material	 will	 be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1067
almost	 purely	 fantasy,	 and	 in	 others	 the	 most
serious	kind	of	abuse	and	exposure	to	real	horror
and	 death	 has	 taken	 place.	 Still,	 no	 matter	 how
great	the	traumata,	it	is	the	basic	fantasy	activity
woven	 around	 traumata	 that	 has	 the	 primary
effect	on	all	the	patient’s	subsequent	behavior	and
capacity	to	relate	to	other	people.
If	this	vital	core	can	be	reached,	identified,	and
worked	 through	 with	 the	 patient,	 the	 past	 can
recede	 and	 no	 longer	 pervade	 the	 present.	 The
ghosts	 can	 become	 ancestors	 (Loewald	 1960).
This	offers	the	ego	new	options,	new	choices,	and
new	 compromises	 in	 dealing	 with	 the	 id,	 the
superego,	 and	 reality.	 Thus,	 although	 change	 can
occur	 in	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 through	 a	 new
object	 relationship	 or	 an	 empathic	 experience
with	an	understanding	analyst,	a	basic	structural
change	
that	
does	
not	
simply	
consist	
of
identification	or	internalization	of	a	more	benign
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1068
object	can	only	come	about,	in	my	opinion,	when
there	 has	 been	 a	 thorough	 understanding	 of	 the
early	 infantile	 fantasy	 activity	 that	 forms	 the
background	mental	set	of	the	patient’s	perceptual
and	motor	system,	the	core	of	the	patient’s	psychic
reality.	Derivatives	of	these	fantasies	can	be	found
in	every	aspect	of	the	patient’s	choices,	behavior,
and	 relationships	 in	 later	 life	 and	 persist	 to	 an
amazing	degree	even	into	old	age.	Hence	the	wise
saying,	“If	you	do	what	you’ve	always	done,	you’ll
get	what	you’ve	always	got.”
It	 has	 also	 been	 my	 experience	 that	 some
analyses	 are	 aborted	 as	 this	 core	 is	 approached;
the	treatment	is	covered	over	by	a	superficial	and
premature	turn	toward	increased	integration	and
maturation,	giving	the	impression	that	the	patient
has	made	a	recovery	and	suggesting	termination.
The	 uncovering	 of	 these	 fantasies	 is	 vigorously
defended	against,	as	they	represent	some	kind	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1069
crucial	 compromise	 formation	 in	 an	 attempt	 to
master	infantile	anxieties,	traumata,	and	conflicts.
To	expose	them	renders	the	patient	vulnerable	to
reexperiencing	 the	 intense	 dread	 of	 annihilation
and	 overwhelming	 fragmentation	 the	 infant
suffered	 at	 a	 time	 when	 it	 was	 as	 yet	 extremely
incapable	 of	 dealing	 with	 such	 powerful	 affects.
This,	 in	 my	 judgment,	 forms	 the	 bedrock	 of
analytic	 treatment;	 if	 the	 patient	 cannot	 bear	 to
have	 this	 core	 exposed,	 the	 treatment	 will	 abort
and	 remain	 a	 psychotherapy	 even	 though	 an
apparently	superficial	improvement	in	the	patient
may	take	place.	This	leaves	the	patient	vulnerable
to	continual	pervasion	of	his	or	her	behavior	and
choices	 by	 the	 core	 infantile	 fantasy	 activity,	 so
that	the	improvement	is	maintained	only	as	long
as	the	internalization	of	the	therapist	continues.
Fenichel	 (1941)	 wrote	 a	 classic	 on	 standard
psychoanalytic	
technique.	
For	
him,	
the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1070
psychoanalytic	 tool	 is	 the	 unconscious	 of	 the
analyst,	
which	
intuitively	
comprehends	
the
unconscious	 of	 the	 patient.	 The	 aim	 of	 the
treatment	 is	 to	 lift	 this	 comprehension	 out	 of
intuition	into	scientific	clarity.	We	try	to	influence
the	ego	by	strengthening	it	to	help	defend	against
the	 instincts	 and	 by	 bringing	 the	 ego	 to	 give	 up
less	 suitable	 defenses	 and	 replace	 them	 by	 more
suitable	 ones.	 For	 Fenichel,	 all	 psychoanalysis	 is
ego	 analysis.	 We	 are	 told	 to	 always	 start	 at	 the
surface	 with	 interpretations:	 the	 patient	 must
determine	 the	 subject	 matter	 of	 the	 hour,	 and
interpretation	 of	 resistance	 (see	 RESISTANCE)
must	precede	the	interpretation	of	content.	We	are
to	
avoid	
too	
deep	
or	
too	
superficial
interpretations.	 The	 libidinal	 strivings	 of	 the
analyst	 are	 less	 dangerous	 than	 his	 or	 her
narcissistic	 needs	 and	 defenses	 against	 anxiety.
The	patient	should	always	be	able	to	rely	on	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1071
humaneness	 of	 the	 analyst;	 neither	 can	 isolate
psychoanalysis	 from	 life.	 The	 task	 of	 analysis	 is
confrontation	 of	 the	 ego	 with	 that	 which	 was
warded	off,	and	the	effective	factor	is	the	patient’s
own	rediscovery	of	this	material.	One	can	see	even
from	 these	 brief	 descriptions	 of	 Fenichel’s
technique	how	different	the	traditional	or	natural
sciences	view	of	psychoanalysis	is	from	that	of	the
hermeneuticists	 discussed	 above.	 There	 is	 no
agreement;	 each	 side	 rejects	 the	 views	 of	 the
other,	and	Grünbaum	(1984)	rejects	both	sides.

PSYCHONEUROSIS
(see	NEUROSIS)
Frosch	 (1983)	 presents	 a	 thorough	 review	 of
the	psychotic	process	utilizing	a	basic	traditional
PSYCHOSIS
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1073
ego	 psychology.	 For	 Frosch,	 ego	 defects,	 such	 as
the	loss	of	reality	testing,	are	brought	into	service
as	a	defense	against	basic	anxiety.	This	anxiety	is
the	 fear	 of	 dissolution	 and	 disintegration	 of	 the
self.	 But	 due	 to	 regressive	 dedifferentiation,	 this
defense	carries	the	possible	loss	of	the	self	and	so
actually	increases	the	anxiety	in	a	circular	process.
Consequently,	the	ego	is	invaded	by	unneutralized
aggressive	 and	 libidinal	 id	 derivatives	 (see
NEUTRALIZATION).	 There	 is	 a	 strong	 primary
process	 influence	 due	 to	 the	 regression,	 and	 so
marked	 ambivalence	 occurs.	 In	 the	 patient’s
superego	 archaic	 precursors	 predominate;	 these
exist	 pari	 passu	 with	 superego	 lacunae	 and	 the
consequent	
impulsive	
breakthrough	
of
unacceptable	 behavior	 and	 harsh	 reactions,	 with
subsequent	severe	guilt	and	depression.
For	 Frosch,	 the	 defects	 in	 psychotic	 patients
are	 already	 in	 the	 ego	 and	 are	 exploited	 for	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1074
purpose	 of	 defense.	 Frosch	 reviews	 a	 variety	 of
other	 theories	 of	 psychoses,	 ranging	 from	 the
purely	organic	to	the	purely	psychoanalytic.	All	of
these	definitions	are	probably	true,	depending	on
which	psychosis	one	is	talking	about.
What	 is	 common	 to	 the	 psychoses?	 Probably
the	most	important	mark	of	each	psychosis	is	the
failure	in	reality	testing.	A	psychosis	in	a	sense	has
a	 sociological	 definition	 because	 the	 patient’s
reality	 testing	 is	 measured	 against	 the	 reality
testing	of	the	psychiatrist,	who	is	assumed	to	be
sane.	Since	a	psychosis	renders	a	person	unable	to
adapt	 or	 integrate	 into	 his	 or	 her	 immediate
culture	 and	 environment,	 another	 sociologic
definition	 is	 implied.	 Because	 of	 this,	 Foucault
(1973)	argues	that	“psychosis”	is	always	a	relative
term	 and	 in	 a	 sense	 cannot	 be	 scientifically
defined.	Such	views	are,	of	course,	extreme	views,
because	 in	 general	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 determine
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1075
when	 an	 individual	 has	 a	 flagrant	 psychosis,
whether	it	be	organic,	psychogenic,	or	both.
The	
classification	
of	
psychoses	
remains
unsatisfactory	and	is	always	being	questioned	by
one	 author	 or	 another,	 but	 there	 seems	 to	 be	 a
general	 consensus	 that	 many	 psychoses	 are	 best
treated	by	a	combination	of	psychopharmacologic
agents,	
supportive	
psychotherapy,	
and
manipulation	of	the	environment	in	various	ways.
Psychotic	patients	do	form	transferences,	although
these	are	archaic	(see	ARCHAIC	TRANSFERENCES,
EGO	
STATES).	
They	
are	
amenable	
to
interpretation	
but,	
because	
of	
the	
severe
disruptions	in	reality	testing	and	gross	and	bizarre
behavior	 that	 are	 based	 on	 disrupted	 reality
testing,	additional	measures	are	usually	necessary
in	the	treatment	of	the	psychoses.
Those	 psychotherapists	 who	 attempt	 to	 treat
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1076
the	psychoses	without	these	additional	measures
leave	 themselves	 open	 to	 possible	 malpractice
suits.	 Because	 of	 this,	 there	 has	 been	 a	 certain
neglect	of	attempts	to	psychoanalyze	patients	with
psychoses	 these	 days,	 as	 compared	 to	 the
wonderful	 work	 of	 Sullivan	 (1947,	 1953,	 1956)
and	
Fromm-Reichmann	
(1950).	
This	
is
unfortunate,	because	residents	and	students	today
no	 longer	 have	 the	 opportunity	 to	 listen	 to
psychotic	 patients	 who	 are	 not	 thoroughly
tranquilized.	 Psychotic	 patients	 can	 teach	 us	 a
great	 deal	 about	 the	 unconscious	 mind	 and	 also
have	 a	 wonderful	 capacity	 to	 teach	 us	 about
ourselves;	 unfortunately,	 they	 always	 teach	 us
about	the	most	unpleasant	and	repressed	aspects
of	 ourselves,	 so	 most	 psychotherapists	 are	 only
too	 happy	 to	 tranquilize	 them.	 Listening	 to	 the
psychotic	patient	is	a	unique	experience	and	is	one
of	 the	 best	 ways	 to	 convince	 a	 student	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1077
power	 of	 the	 unconscious	 and	 of	 psychodynamic
factors	 because	 the	 psychotic	 patient	 often	 lays
these	 out	 before	 the	 therapist	 with	 very	 little	 in
the	way	of	“resistances.”

The	 psychosomatic	 approach	 may	 be	 defined
as	the	study	of	the	influence	of	emotional	factors
in	 any	 disease	 and	 the	 investigation	 of	 the
coordination	of	somatic	and	psychological	factors
with	 each	 other.	 In	 the	 chain	 of	 causal	 events
leading	to	certain	illnesses,	some	of	the	links	can
be	 described	 only	 in	 psychological	 terms,	 and
these	 are	 what	 we	 look	 for	 in	 classical
psychosomatic	studies.
There	 are	 three	 types	 of	 influence	 of
psychological	processes	on	body	functions,	which
constitute	 the	 three	 areas	 commonly	 studied	 in
psychosomatic	 medicine:	 coordinated	 voluntary
behavior,	 the	 motivational	 background	 of	 which
can	 be	 described	 only	 in	 psychological	 terms;
Darwin’s	 (1965)	 “expressive	 innervations,”	 the
purpose	of	which	is	to	bring	about	a	discharge	of
emotional	
tension;	
and	
possibly	
adaptive
PSYCHOSOMATIC
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1079
responses	 that	 take	 place	 in	 the	 visceral	 organs,
involving	
neither	
direct	
goals,	
conscious
motivations,	 nor	 the	 immediate	 discharge	 of
emotional	tension.	Cannon	(1953)	explained	these
responses	as	changes	in	the	body	economy	under
the	influence	of	emotions	and	introduced	the	idea
of	an	adaptive	preparation	for	fight	or	flight.
For	 example,	 the	 wish	 to	 receive	 food,	 if
sustained,	
has	
certain	
typical	
physiologic
responses	associated	with	it,	such	as	the	secretion
of	 gastric	 juices.	 These	 responses	 become
pathological	 only	 in	 situations	 of	 stored	 tension
over	 a	 long	 period	 of	 time.	 Thus,	 when	 no	 relief
from	 the	 emotional	 problem	 or	 conflict	 by
voluntary	activity	is	possible,	the	organic	difficulty
begins	to	occur.	When	the	voluntary	behavior	that
would	 relieve	 the	 emotional	 tension	 never	 takes
place—due,	 for	 example,	 to	 conflicts	 about	 this
behavior—the	 perpetuation	 of	 the	 wish	 leads	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1080
organic	 pathology.	 This	 approach	 stresses	 the
chronicity	of	the	situation.
The	 early	 literature	 on	 psychosomatic	 illness
(Alexander	1950)	attempted	to	demonstrate	that
patients	 with	 such	 diseases	 as	 bronchial	 asthma,
peptic	
ulcer,	
ulcerative	
colitis,	
rheumatoid
arthritis,	
hypertension,	
neurodermatitis,	
and
hyperthyroidism	had	common	specific	features	of
personality.	
This	
work	
has	
been	
largely
discredited.	It	is	not	necessary	to	postulate	specific
complex	
psychological	
drive/conflict
constellations	
in	
explaining	
each	
of	
the
psychosomatic	disorders.	For	example,	narcissistic
psychosomatic	disorders	(Chessick	1985)	may	be
defined	 as	 pathological,	 altered	 body	 conditions
secondary	
to	
certain	
chronic	
narcissistic
personality	and	behavior	patterns.	These	patterns,
like	 narcissistic	 personality	 and	 narcissistic
behavior	disorders,	arise	out	of	basic	defects	in	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1081
structure	of	the	self	that	produce	a	state	of	chronic
narcissistic	 disequilibrium	 superimposed	 on	 a
faulty	self-soothing	apparatus.	The	patterns,	along
with	 their	 physiological	 concomitants,	 represent
failed	efforts	at	restoring	narcissistic	equilibrium,
are	 repetitive	 and	 chronic	 in	 nature,	 and	 are
accompanied	by	narcissistic	rage	secondary	to	the
failures—which	 imposes	 an	 additional	 chronic
burden	on	the	already	faulty	drive-channeling	and
drive-controlling	 capacities	 and	 increases	 the
disequilibrium,	 leading	 to	 a	 vicious	 pathological
spiral	 and	 possible	 chronic	 physiological	 self-
destruction.	
The	
“type-A”	
personality	
that
accompanies	 coronary	 artery	 disease	 is	 a	 well-
known	 example.	 In	 addition,	 there	 are	 always
multiple	
genetic	
and	
constitutional	
factors
involved.
Of	course,	psychosomatic	disorders	have	to	be
distinguished	 from	 conversion	 reactions	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1082
organic	
diseases.	
Anyone	
who	
attempts
psychotherapy	 with	 such	 disorders	 must	 be
thoroughly	trained	in	medicine	and	psychiatry	or
work	very	closely	with	a	consultant.	It	is	extremely
dangerous	when	misdiagnosis	takes	place	or	early
signs	of	exacerbation	of	the	psychosomatic	illness
are	overlooked.

PSYCHOTHERAPY
Psychotherapy	is	based	on	a	paid	professional
relationship	 undertaken	 by	 the	 patient	 for	 the
purpose	 of	 the	 relief	 of	 mental	 suffering,	 the
various	 syndromes	 of	 which	 are	 delineated	 in
DSM-III-R	 (1987).	 The	 patient	 assumes	 that	 the
psychotherapist	 has	 had	 a	 thorough	 training	 in
diagnostic	 and	 treatment	 techniques	 and	 a
personal	 psychoanalysis	 that	 will	 maximally
ensure	against	countertransference	acting	out	and
enable	 the	 psychotherapist	 to	 listen	 to	 what	 the
patient	 is	 trying	 to	 communicate.	 Symptom
removal	attempted	primarily	under	the	influence
of	 some	 sort	 of	 relationship	 is	 known	 as
supportive	 psychotherapy.	 If	 the	 focus	 is	 on
allowing	
the	
transference	
to	
develop	
and
interpreting	 it	 when	 it	 does	 so,	 then	 the	 usual
uncovering	
techniques	
that	
define	
the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1084
psychoanalytic	 approach	 can	 be	 used	 (see
PSYCHOANALYSIS).
Heraclitus	said	that	“character	is	the	demon	in
man,”	 by	 which	 he	 meant,	 I	 believe,	 that	 the
driving	 force	 of	 a	 person’s	 behavior,	 the	 motor
behind	success	or	difficulties	in	living,	is	our	basic
characterological	 structure.	 This	 character,	 or
personality,	is	formed	in	the	first	few	years	of	life
in	 a	 series	 of	 epigenetic	 layers,	 beginning	 with	 a
unification	of	the	sense	of	self	and	laying	down	of
self-soothing	
techniques	
or	
apparatuses,
proceeding	to	the	development	and	integration	of
narcissistic	structures,	and	consolidating	upon	the
resolution	of	the	Oedipus	complex.	After	that,	with
a	 renewed	 phase	 of	 flux	 and	 consolidation	 in
adolescence	and	a	series	of	tasks	and	experiences
that	can	be	growth-promoting	later	in	life,	such	as
marriage	 and	 parenting	 (and	 grandparenting),
further	modifications	of	character	are	possible	but
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1085
less	likely,	in	a	fundamental	sense.
The	 findings	 of	 almost	 one	 hundred	 years	 of
psychoanalytic	investigation	have	provided	a	solid
base	 of	 understanding	 of	 at	 least	 the	 outlines	 of
character	 formation	 and	 personality	 functioning.
Although	several	theories	present	alternate	views
on	 the	 details,	 the	 usual	 assortment	 of	 Freudian
drive/conflict/defense,	 object	 relations	 (whether
Kleinian	 or	 neo-Kleinian),	 and	 self	 psychological
approaches	and	theoretical	formulations	serve	in
practice	
to	
define	
the	
basis	
of	
our
conceptualization	 of	 what	 has	 happened	 to
produce	the	individual	we	are	trying	to	help.	Some
authors	 like	 myself	 (Chessick	 1989)	 also	 like	 to
call	
on	
the	
“phenomenological”	
and	
the
“interactive”	points	of	view,	especially	when	they
are	stumped.
This	theoretical	basis	defines	our	approach	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1086
the	 patient	 in	 terms	 of	 setting	 goals,	 techniques,
and	practices.	After	careful	listening	to	the	patient,
a	 decision	 needs	 to	 be	 made	 as	 to	 whether	 the
psychotherapy	 offered	 will	 be	 primarily	 for	 the
purpose	of	uncovering	or	support.
If	 supportive	 therapy	 is	 the	 primary	 mode,
then,	
providing	
the	
presuppositions	
just
mentioned	 are	 correct,	 any	 technique	 that	 is
pleasing	both	to	the	therapist	and	to	the	patient	is
acceptable.	 This	 includes	 a	 whole	 variety	 of
therapies,	 whether	 group,	 family,	 or	 individually
oriented,	 that	 are	 described	 in	 sections	 of	 any
standard	textbook,	sometimes	with	the	founder’s
name	 attached	 and	 sometimes	 not.	 The	 point	 of
support	is	to	improve	the	cohesion	of	the	patient’s
sense	 of	 self	 by	 offering	 either	 mirroring
techniques	
or	
an	
idealizable	
figure	
for
identification,	
validation,	
permission,	
and
education.	Regardless	of	the	technique	used,	from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1087
the	point	of	view	of	psychoanalytic	psychotherapy
manipulation	 of	 the	 transference	 is	 the	 method
employed	 to	 bring	 about	 change.	 Hence	 the
advantage	of	beginning	with	a	psychoanalytically
trained	and	oriented	psychotherapist.
If	 uncovering	 psychotherapy	 is	 the	 primary
mode,	 then	 only	 the	 psychoanalytic	 orientation
offers	 an	 escape	 from	 conscious	 or	 unconscious
collusion	with	the	patient	to	avoid	facing	the	truth
of	 the	 patient.	 This	 method	 requires	 special
techniques	 and	 capacities	 in	 the	 psychotherapist
in	order	to	let	the	material	emerge	in	a	relatively
undisturbed	
fashion	
and	
to	
facilitate	
the
development	
of	
transference	
manifestations.
Interpretation	
of	
these	
transference
manifestations	offers	the	patient	insight	into	his	or
her	mental	suffering	and	the	basic	functioning	of
his	or	her	character	(see	ANALYTIC	THERAPY).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1088
Psychoanalytic	
psychotherapy	
and
psychoanalysis	 are	 currently	 regarded	 in	 the
United	 States	 as	 unfashionable,	 unpleasant,	 and
economically	 questionable.	 A	 certain	 level	 of
sophistication	is	required	for	a	patient	to	be	able
to	 rise	 above	 the	 popular	 opinion;	 usually	 this
develops	only	after	the	patient	has	tried	a	variety
of	other	simpler,	cheaper,	and	more	enjoyable	and
appealing	 techniques,	 of	 which	 there	 seem	 to	 be
no	end,	and	which	come	and	go	in	fashion.
Karl	
Jaspers	
(1972),	
philosopher	
and
psychiatrist,	 said	 that	 the	 doctor	 is	 the	 patient’s
fate.	 A	 lot	 depends	 on	 the	 doctor	 to	 whom	 the
patient	 is	 referred,	 a	 referral	 that	 often	 depends
more	on	the	capacity	of	the	doctor	to	develop	and
nourish	referral	sources	than	on	the	validity	of	his
or	 her	 technique.	 Patients	 able	 to	 accept	 only
supportive	psychotherapy	are	not	harmed	by	this
unless	the	presuppositions	of	proper	training	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1089
personal	psychoanalysis	mentioned	above	are	not
met.
Uncovering	psychoanalytic	psychotherapy	has
many	 pitfalls.	 It	 is	 long,	 time-consuming,	 and
expensive.	There	are	not	many	good	studies	either
validating	 or	 invalidating	 it,	 which	 works	 to	 the
advantage	 of	 insurance	 companies	 and	 business
corporations	 who	 wish	 to	 minimize	 employee
benefits	 for	 mental	 illness;	 they	 claim	 it	 is	 not
proven	to	be	“cost-effective.”	This	uncertainty	and
lack	 of	 coverage	 causes	 many	 problems	 for	 the
patient	 and	 his	 or	 her	 family.	 Yet	 such	 therapy
often	
prevents	
much	
more	
expensive
hospitalization	and	collapse,	as	demonstrated	in	a
number	 of	 studies,	 even	 as	 early	 as	 1958	 by
Hollingshead	and	Redlich.
The	 assessment	 of	 a	 long-term	 uncovering
psychotherapy	is	extremely	difficult	for	an	outside
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1090
party	
since	
it	
is	
primarily	
a	
two-person
relationship	 and	 stands	 or	 falls	 on	 the	 basis	 of
what	happens	in	that	relationship.	Even	recording
of	 such	 therapies	 has	 proven	 unsatisfactory
because	
it	
profoundly	
interferes	
with	
the
treatment	 itself	 (no	 matter	 how	 much	 collusion
there	is	to	pretend	it	does	not	matter,	it	represents
an	 unempathic	 invasion	 of	 privacy)	 and	 because
so	 much	 data	 are	 gathered	 that	 it	 is	 extremely
difficult	 to	 develop	 criteria	 and	 techniques	 to
“analyze”	 the	 data	 for	 anything	 really	 relevant,
although	 advanced	 computer	 techniques	 hold	 at
least	the	theoretical	hope	that	this	problem	can	be
overcome.
Training	of	psychotherapists	is	in	a	very	poor
state,	 with	 all	 sorts	 of	 programs	 designed	 to
produce	 the	 various	 medical,	 nonmedical,	 and
paramedical	
professionals	
who	
offer
“psychotherapy”	 to	 the	 public.	 There	 is	 no
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1091
coordination	 and	 no	 agreed-upon	 standards	 of
training.	To	do	effective	intensive	psychoanalytic
psychotherapy	 requires	 the	 most	 meticulous
training	and	most	complete	analysis	on	the	part	of
the	 therapist.	 Therefore	 most	 “psychotherapists”
today	 avoid	 the	 whole	 thing.	 A	 once-a-week
psychotherapy	for	a	year	or	two	is	not	a	personal
training	 psychoanalysis.	 It	 does	 not	 prepare	 a
student	 to	 practice	 psychotherapy.	 As	 a	 result,	 a
whole	 variety	 of	 acting	 out	 goes	 on,	 leading	 to
many	messy	situations	in	which	the	patient	runs
the	risk	of	being	exploited	or	retaliated	against	or
forced	into	dependent	compliance.
Psychoanalytic	
psychotherapy	
in	
an
uncovering	 mode	 carried	 out	 by	 an	 untrained
psychotherapist	 poses	 the	 greatest	 risk	 to	 the
patient;	 it	 is	 analogous	 to	 brain	 surgery	 carried
out	by	a	barber.	So	the	major	disadvantage	of	my
approach	 is	 in	 the	 demands	 it	 makes	 on	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1092
therapist.	In	an	age	that	values	fast-fast-fast	relief
above	all,	the	tendency	is	to	bypass	these	slower
techniques	or	to	present	a	mine	of	misinformation
or	“wild	psychoanalysis”	(see	WILD	ANALYSIS)	to
the	patient,	sometimes	even	over	the	telephone	or
on	 a	 radio	 or	 TV	 talk	 show.	 It	 is	 easy	 to	 make	 a
mockery	
of	
intensive	
psychoanalytic
psychotherapy,	and	there	is	always	a	patient	who
is	 eager	 to	 enter	 into	 collusion	 with	 such
“therapists”	in	order	to	avoid	facing	the	truth.
A	 serious	 problem	 manifests	 itself	 among
psychoanalytic	psychotherapists	themselves,	even
those	with	proper	training.	There	is	a	longstanding
tradition,	 beginning	 with	 Freud’s	 experience,	 of
professional	
schisms	
and	
theoretical
disagreements	degenerating	into	the	formation	of
opposing	 groups,	 who	 then	 proceed	 to	 malign
each	 other	 publicly	 in	 a	 most	 immature	 fashion.
There	 is	 no	 commonly	 accepted	 “truth”	 among
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1093
psychoanalytic	 systems	 at	 this	 time,	 although
some	 clearly	 have	 greater	 clinical	 validity	 and
capacity	
to	
be	
empirically	
tested	
in	
the
psychoanalytic	 consulting	 room	 than	 others.	 A
lack	of	tolerance	among	opposing	theoreticians	for
each	 other	 personally,	 and	 a	 lack	 of	 civilized
dialogue	 and	 exchange	 of	 ideas	 on	 an	 academic
plane,	 make	 it	 harder	 to	 examine	 and	 resolve
apparently	 irreconcilable	 theoretical	 stances	 and
add	 to	 the	 chaos	 in	 the	 field	 for	 no	 acceptable
reason.	In	some	instances	even	angry	litigation	has
been	 initiated	 between	 opposing	 professional
groups,	to	the	cost	and	detriment	of	everybody.

Q-R
QUASI-INDEPENDENCE
(FAIRBAIRN)
W.	 R.	 D.	 Fairbairn	 (1889-1964)	 formed	 his
theories	 in	 reaction	 to	 Melanie	 Klein’s	 work
because	he	felt	that	the	so-called	biological	or	id
basis	 of	 her	 theories	 should	 be	 eliminated.	 For
Fairbairn,	the	individual	begins	with	a	pristine	ego
that	 out	 of	 its	 inherent	 energy	 strives	 for	 self-
development.	His	work	gets	into	difficulty	because
he	 assumes	 that	 the	 ego	 becomes	 split	 in	 all
development,	normal	as	well	as	pathological.	The
precise	metapsychological	meaning	of	Fairbairn’s
split-up	 psychic	 self	 is	 not	 clear;	 for	 example,	 it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1096
employs	 the	 undefinable	 notion	 of	 “internalized
object.”	Fairbairn	uses	ego	in	his	theories	to	mean
the	 psychic	 self	 (Guntrip	 1974).	 The	 struggle	 of
this	 split-up	 psychic	 self	 to	 cope	 with	 the	 outer
world	is	the	problem,	rather	than	the	struggle,	of
the	ego	with	the	id.	In	Fairbairn’s	view,	there	is	no
id.	 Fairbairn	 thus	 differs	 fundamentally	 with
Freud	
and	
presents	
an	
entirely	
different
metapsychology	(Rangell	1985).
Fairbairn,	Winnicott,	and	Balint	emphasize	the
primacy	 of	 the	 environment	 and	 the	 mother’s
influence.	
Unless	
“good	
enough	
mothering”
(Winnicott	 1958)	 occurs,	 the	 infant	 increasingly
frequents	 the	 inner	 world	 of	 fantasy	 objects,	 but
the	 ego	 always	 seeks	 and	 needs	 objects	 and
always	 stands	 in	 some	 relationship	 to	 them.	 The
ego	 is	 never	 regarded	 as	 an	 abstract	 set	 of
functions	or	subsystems.	Libido,	for	Fairbairn,	in	a
totally	 non-Freudian	 definition,	 is	 always	 object-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1097
seeking	rather	than	seeking	discharge;	libido	is	the
energy	 of	 the	 search	 for	 good	 objects,	 which
makes	ego	differentiation	and	growth	possible.	As
in	the	subsequent	work	of	Kohut,	Fairbairn	views
aggression	not	as	an	instinct,	but	as	a	reaction	to
the	frustration	of	libidinal	drive.
Fairbairn	 (1954)	 attempted	 to	 replace	 the
classical	 concept	 of	 psychosexual	 development
that	
Freud	
(1905)	
began	
with	
three
developmental	stages	of	object	relations	based	on
the	vicissitudes	of	dependence	on	the	mother.	In
the	 infantile	 dependence	 stage	 the	 infant	 is
literally	 dependent	 on	 the	 actual	 breast	 as	 a
biological	object.	There	is	an	incorporation	of	the
object	 in	 this	 stage	 rather	 than	 the	 libidinal
investment	
of	
the	
mouth,	
resulting	
in
internalization	 of	 the	 breast.	 These	 are	 primary
identifications	
that	
Fairbairn	
postulated	
as
representing	 fusion	 with	 an	 object	 not	 yet	 fully
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1098
differentiated	from	the	self.
In	 the	 quasi-independence	 stage	 there	 is	 a
transitional	
situation	
in	
which	
partial
independence	of	the	breast	is	achieved	by	means
of	certain	transitional	techniques.	These	constitute
an	 organization	 of	 the	 internal	 world	 with	 the
internal	
representations	
of	
the	
objects,
accompanied	by	extrusion	of	the	“bad”	parts	of	the
object.	 During	 this	 stage,	 Fairbairn	 says,	 an
“excretory	attitude”	is	manifest,	but	not	related	to
Freud’s	concept	of	libidinal	investment	of	the	anal
zone.
The	stage	of	mature	dependence	is	marked	by
the	give-and-take	relationship	with	whole	objects
and	a	complete	differentiation	of	the	self	from	the
object.	 This	 last	 phase	 has	 some	 superficial
resemblance	 to	 the	 later	 work	 of	 Kohut,	 who
emphasizes	 the	 “empathic	 matrix”	 needed	 by	 all
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1099
adults.	All	this	differs	from	classical	theory	in	that
the	stages	of	development	are	defined	not	in	terms
of	erotogenic	zones,	but	in	terms	of	the	relation	to
an	 object.	 Also,	 the	 various	 neuroses	 are	 not
regarded	 as	 regressions	 to	 different	 levels	 of
libidinal	
development,	
but	
as	
pathological
solutions	to	the	problem	of	achieving	detachment
from	the	breast.
Fairbairn	(Guntrip	1974)	presents	a	threefold
split	 in	 the	 psychic	 self	 and	 an	 internal	 struggle
that	 he	 calls	 “internal	 ego-object	 relations.”	 The
infantile	libidinal	ego	(analogous	to	Freud’s	id)	in
a	 state	 of	 dissatisfaction	 is	 related	 to	 an	 internal
bad	object	that	Fairbairn	calls	the	“exciting	object,”
which	excites	but	never	satisfies	the	child’s	needs.
This	 “libidinal	 ego-exciting	 object”	 is	 illustrated
clinically	 in	 the	 dream	 of	 a	 male	 patient	 who
follows	 a	 woman	 who	 constantly	 retreats	 from
him.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1100
The	 next	 sector	 of	 the	 self	 is	 the	 infantile
antilibidinal	 ego	 (the	 sadistic	 part	 of	 Freud’s
superego),	 which	 represents	 the	 identification
with	 rejecting	 objects;	 it	 is	 turned	 against	 the
individual’s	own	libidinal	needs.	A	clinical	example
of	 this	 aspect	 of	 the	 self,	 “the	 antilibidinal	 ego-
rejecting	 object,”	 is	 presented	 in	 the	 dream	 of	 a
female	patient:	“I	was	a	little	girl	who	saw	you	and
thought	‘If	I	get	to	him,	I	will	be	safe.’	And	I	began
to	run	to	you	…	but	another	little	girl	smacked	my
face	 and	 drove	 me	 away”	 (see	 SABOTEUR,
INTERNAL).
The	third	aspect	of	the	self	or	the	central	ego
(Freud’s	 ego)	 is	 the	 conscious	 self	 of	 everyday
living	 attempting	 to	 deal	 with	 reality,	 and	 in	 so
doing	idealizing	the	parents	(the	ideal	object,	the
moral	 aspect	 of	 Freud’s	 superego).	 Thus	 “the
central	 ego-ideal	 object”	 struggles	 to	 preserve
good	 relationships	 with	 the	 parents	 for	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1101
purposes	of	strength	and	adaptation.
Guntrip,	the	analysand	and	pupil	of	Fairbairn,
adds	 an	 ultimate	 split	 in	 schizoid	 patients
postulated	 to	 be	 in	 Fairbairn’s	 infantile	 libidinal
ego	itself.	This	aspect	splits	into	a	clamoring,	orally
active	 hysteric	 libidinal	 ego	 and	 a	 deeply
withdrawn,	 passive	 schizoid	 libidinal	 ego.	 This
latter	 “regressed	 ego”	 is	 experienced	 by	 the
patient	as	a	compulsive	need	to	sleep,	exhaustion,
feelings	of	being	a	nonentity,	a	sense	of	having	lost
part	 of	 the	 self,	 of	 being	 out	 of	 touch—the
commonly	reported	phenomena	of	schizoid	states,
such	as	feeling	that	there	is	a	sheet	of	plate	glass
between	one’s	self	and	the	world.	Guntrip	(1974)
points	out	that	the	patient	may	protect	against	this
sense	 of	 annihilation	 by	 remaining	 chronically
angry	and	fighting	in	order	to	maintain	the	energy
level.	 This	 should	 be	 compared	 with	 Kohut’s
(1977)	later	theory	in	which	the	patient	produces
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1102
a	 pseudodramatization	 of	 everything	 in	 order	 to
defend	against	the	unbearable	subjective	sense	of
a	depleted,	empty	self.
Fairbairn	
(1963)	
published	
a	
one-page
summary	 of	 his	 complex	 views.	 Guntrip	 (1974)
attempts	 to	 explain	 this	 theory,	 which,	 as	 stated,
rests	 on	 an	 apparently	 metapsychologically
untenable	notion	of	internalized	objects.	Kernberg
(1980)	 offers	 some	 stimulating	 ideas	 on	 the	 use
made	 by	 Guntrip	 of	 Fairbairn’s	 theory,	 and	 he
criticizes	 them	 both	 from	 his	 own	 point	 of	 view.
Klein	 and	 Tribich	 (1981)	 denounce	 Kernberg’s
criticism	of	Fairbairn	severely;	they	seem	to	prefer
Fairbairn’s	 object	 relations	 theory	 over	 that	 of
Kernberg.	 The	 psychology	 of	 the	 self	 movement
(see	 SELF	 PSYCHOLOGY)	 shares	 with	 Fairbairn,
Balint,	and	Winnicott	the	emphasis	on	the	mother-
infant	 interaction	 ambience	 as	 crucial	 to	 the
formation	of	the	basic	personality.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1103
Robbins	
(1980)	
reviews	
the	
current
controversy	 in	 object	 relations	 theory,	 pointing
out	the	striking	resemblance	between	the	views	of
Kohut	 and	 the	 ideas	 of	 Fairbairn.	 Robbins
contrasts	 the	 views	 of	 Fairbairn	 and	 Kohut	 with
those	 of	 Klein	 and	 Kernberg,	 which	 he	 feels	 are
also	closely	related	to	each	other.
According	to	Robbins,	Fairbairn’s	terminology
is	 confusing	 because	 Fairbairn	 uses	 the	 ego
ambiguously	to	signify	a	primary	self	rather	than
simply	
an	
intrapsychic	
structure.	
Robbins
criticizes	 Fairbairn	 because	 the	 latter’s	 theory
assumes	 capacities	 to	 differentiate	 among	 part
objects	and	affects,	and	to	introject,	segregate,	and
structure	experience,	all	of	which	may	be	beyond
the	capacity	of	the	infant.	He	adds:
His	 core	 ideas	 are	 harbingers	 of	 Kohut,
particularly	 his	 de-emphasis	 of	 libido,	 his
conception	of	aggression	as	a	disintegration
product,	 and	 his	 focus	 on	 the	 primary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1104
relationship	 between	 the	 self	 as	 a	 dynamic
structure	and	an	empathic	self-object.	When
such	a	relationship	fails	or	disappoints,	both
Fairbairn	and	Kohut	describe	the	expression
of	 rage,	 the	 development	 of	 perverse,	 auto-
erotic	phenomena,	and	an	overall	picture	of
detachment	and	apathy,	[p.	484]

RECONSTRUCTION,
CONSTRUCTION
Traditional	views	of	reconstruction	in	analysis
are	 presented	 by	 Blum	 (1980)	 and	 Greenacre
(1981).	 But	 Arlow	 (1991)	 reminds	 us	 that,	 for
Freud,	reconstruction	is	inferred	from	derivatives.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1106
As	 Freud	 (1937)	 said,	 “Quite	 often	 we	 do	 not
succeed	 in	 bringing	 the	 patient	 to	 recollect	 what
has	been	repressed.	Instead	of	that,	if	the	analysis
is	 carried	 out	 correctly,	 we	 produce	 in	 him	 an
assured	conviction	of	the	truth	of	the	construction
which	 achieves	 the	 same	 therapeutic	 result	 as	 a
recaptured	memory”	(pp.	265-266).
Arlow	 warns	 us	 of	 Hartmann’s	 “genetic
fallacy,”	 in	 which	 the	 therapist	 forces	 on	 the
patient’s	associations	an	interpretation	based	on	a
concept	 of	 pathogenesis	 using	 a	 preconceived
model.	Derivatives	appear	in	the	associations	and
dreams	 of	 the	 patients	 and	 in	 compromise
formations,	 not	 just	 in	 a	 repetition	 of	 events;
similarly,	the	transference	is	not	just	a	repetition
of	 the	 past,	 claims	 Arlow.	 Arlow	 objects	 to	 any
object	 relations	 theory	 (see	 OBJECT	 RELATIONS
THEORY)	 that	 assumes	 that	 in	 later	 life	 there	 is
simple	repetition	of	early	object	relations	formed
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1107
in	the	first	three	years	of	life.	He	argues	that	this
assumes	too	much	beyond	the	infant’s	capacity	for
memory	 and	 structure.	 He	 is	 very	 skeptical	 of
preverbal	reconstructions	and	finds	it	obsolete	to
request	 the	 recall	 of	 very	 early	 precise	 events.
Accurate	 reconstructions,	 according	 to	 Arlow,
synthesize	and	produce	further	material.
Arlow	 argues	 that	 what	 appears	 to	 be
repetition	 in	 the	 transference	 “most	 often
constitutes	repetitions	of	earlier	experiences	that,
even	 in	 childhood,	 were	 derivative,	 acted-out
manifestations	
of	
the	
unconscious	
fantasy,
elaborated	 in	 connection	 with	 a	 traumatic
experience	 or	 relationship”	 (p.	 547).	 The	 child’s
capacities	 for	 symbolization,	 structuralization	 of
memory,	 and	 fantasy	 formation	 in	 the	 preverbal
period	 are	 quite	 limited	 compared	 to	 what
develops	in	the	second	and	third	year	of	life.	Arlow
objects	 to	 the	 idea	 that	 specific	 sets	 of	 early
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1108
interactions	with	objects	come	to	have	a	dynamic
thrust	 of	 their	 own	 so	 they	 are	 compulsively
repeated	in	later	life,	even	in	situations	in	which
they	 are	 inappropriate.	 He	 insists	 on	 a	 drive
investment	in	any	object	relationship	and	claims,
“It	 seems	 impossible	 for	 the	 memory	 and	 the
significance	 of	 early	 object	 relations	 not	 to
undergo	 some	 transformation	 in	 the	 course	 of
time”	(p.	557).
Because	 psychoanalytic	 formulations	 usually
do	 not	 exactly	 replicate	 earlier	 events	 they	 are
thought	 of	 as	 constructions	 (Freud	 1937)	 rather
than	reconstructions.	These	constructions	lead	to
important	 insights	 and	 help	 to	 understand	 the
background	of	the	patient’s	current	behavior.

REGRESSION
Regression	is	a	well-known	defensive	process
that	involves	reversion	to	an	earlier	state	or	mode
of	 functioning.	 Unfortunately,	 it	 compels	 the
individual	 to	 reexperience	 the	 anxieties	 and
conflicts	that	fit	the	stage	to	which	the	individual
has	regressed.	Since	regression	involves	going	to	a
developmentally	 more	 immature	 level	 of	 mental
functioning,	 it	 usually	 interferes	 with	 adaptation
and	even	reality	testing	(see	NEUROSIS).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1110
Readers	of	Freud	may	be	confused	by	the	fact
that	he	uses	the	concept	of	regression	in	several
different	ways:	(a)	temporal	regression,	defined	as
returning	 to	 earlier	 reaction	 patterns	 or	 to
temporally	 earlier	 modes	 of	 psychic	 functioning;
(b)	 formal	 regression,	 involving	 a	 change	 from
general	and	abstract	symbols	to	visual	imagery	as
in	 dreams;	 and	 (c)	 topographical	 regression,
representing	a	change	from	organized	secondary
process	thought	and	behavior	to	primary	process
thought.	 A	 thorough	 discussion	 of	 this	 difficult
subject	is	presented	by	Arlow	and	Brenner	(1984).

RELUCTANT	COMPLIANCE
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1111
This	is	one	of	the	most	controversial	aspects	of
the	
psychology	
of	
the	
self	
(see	
SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).	 “Reluctant	 compliance	 with	 the
childhood	 wish”	 (Kohut	 1978,	 p.	 507)	 denotes	 a
situation	in	which	the	analyst	feels	that,	at	least	in
some	 instances,	 gratification	 of	 a	 childhood	 wish
has	to	be	provided,	usually	in	the	early	part	of	the
treatment,	to	facilitate	the	beginning	of	selfobject
transferences	that	the	patient	could	not	otherwise
tolerate.	This	came	up	in	the	treatment	of	Miss	F.,
Kohut’s	seminal	patient,	who	made	him	aware	of
her	 never-ending	 demand	 for	 mirroring	 (see
MIRROR	TRANSFERENCE).	 She	 wanted	 him	 only
to	summarize	or	repeat	what	she	had	already	said.
Whenever	 he	 went	 beyond	 this	 and	 offered	 an
interpretation,	 the	 patient	 furiously	 accused	 him
in	a	tense,	high-pitched	voice	of	undermining	her.
No	interpretations	based	on	an	oedipal	level	made
any	 difference	 whatsoever.	 Ultimately,	 the	 high-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1112
pitched	tone	of	her	voice,	which	expressed	in	the
tone	of	a	very	young	child	such	utter	conviction	of
being	 right,	 led	 Kohut	 to	 recognize	 that	 he	 was
being	used	for	mirroring	purposes	in	the	patient’s
effort	 to	 replace	 missing	 psychic	 structure.	 He
offered	this	mirroring	that	the	patient	missed	from
the	 mother	 as	 a	 corrective	 emotional	 experience
so	 that	 the	 patient’s	 selfobject	 transference
formation	could	proceed.
It	should	be	noted	that	Kohut	is	not	advocating
reluctant	compliance	with	the	childhood	wish	as	a
curative	factor	but	only	as	an	unavoidable	method
in	 setting	 the	 stage	 for	 the	 ultimate	 working
through	and	interpretation	of	the	transference	by
traditional	 means.	 This	 approach	 has	 sometimes
been	used	as	an	excuse	for	all	sorts	of	acting	out
by	 insufficiently	 analyzed	 psychotherapists,	 for
which	one	cannot	blame	Kohut.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1113
The	 concept	 of	 optimal	 frustration	 (see
OPTIMAL	 FRUSTRATION)	 means	 that	 a	 certain
amount	 of	 compliance	 with	 patients’	 wishes	 is
necessary	if	the	treatment	of	narcissistic	disorders
is	 not	 to	 degenerate	 into	 a	 hostile	 confrontation
with	 accusations	 and	 counteraccusations.	 For
example,	if	the	patient	enters	the	office	early	in	the
treatment	and	wants	to	show	a	picture	of	someone
to	the	therapist,	it	is	usually	better	to	look	at	the
picture	and	then	discuss	the	matter	rather	than	to
refuse	 to	 look	 at	 the	 picture,	 which	 the	 patient
rather	 appropriately	 experiences	 as	 an	 insult.	 A
very	 strict	 orthodox	 ambience	 in	 the	 treatment
can	 produce	 a	 counterproductive	 iatrogenic
narcissistic	withdrawal.
The	problem	that	confronts	the	analyst	and	is	a
challenge	for	his	or	her	self-analysis	is	the	extent
to	 which	 this	 reluctant	 compliance	 with	 the
childhood	 wish	 should	 be	 permitted.	 Too	 much
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1114
compliance	 generates	 the	 desire	 for	 more	 and
usually	 precludes	 a	 successful	 resolution	 of	 the
treatment	process.	The	same	is	true	if	there	is	not
enough	of	it.	This	is	very	tricky,	and	depends	on
the	therapist’s	capacity	to	empathically	grasp	what
the	 patient	 is	 experiencing,	 and	 with	 what
intensity,	at	any	given	time.

REPARATION
Reparation	 is	 a	 Kleinian	 concept	 defined	 as
reducing	guilt	by	making	good	the	imagined	harm
that	 has	 been	 done	 to	 an	 ambivalently	 invested
object.	For	Klein,	all	creative	activity	is	reparative
and	 reparation	 is	 an	 important	 mechanism	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1115
defense	 used	 in	 the	 depressive	 position	 (see
OBJECT	 RELATIONS	 THEORY).	 The	 forms	 of
reparation	 mentioned	 by	 Klein	 (1975)	 are	 (a)
manic	reparation,	which	is	a	reversal	of	the	child-
parent	 relationship	 causing	 humiliation	 to	 the
parents	 and	 a	 sense	 of	 triumph	 in	 the	 child;	 (b)
obsessional	 reparation,	 consisting	 of	 compulsive
repetitions	 of	 undoing	 actions	 designed	 for
magical	
placation;	
and	
(c)	
truly	
creative
reparation	 grounded	 in	 love	 and	 respect	 for	 the
object.
In	 the	 depressive	 position,	 (see	 KLEIN	 and
DEPRESSIVE	 POSITION)	 reparation	 becomes	 the
repair	of	the	internal	world	through	repairing	the
external	 world	 and	 so	 supplies	 great	 energy	 for
creativity.	 It	 is	 called	 out	 by	 the	 anxieties	 of	 the
depressive	 position	 and	 comes	 out	 of	 a	 real
concern	for	the	whole	object:	“Powerful	reparative
urges	 are	 often	 responsible	 for	 lives	 devoted	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1116
humanitarian	ends	and	lived	in	great	hardship.	It
is	a	phantasy	that	may	be	acted	out	with	external
objects—for	 instance	 through	 going	 into	 one	 of
the	 helping	 professions”	 (Hinshelwood	 1989,	 p.
399).	 If	 reparation	 fails,	 or	 is	 interfered	 with	 by
manic	 defenses,	 the	 patient	 may	 suffer	 serious
depressive	 anxiety	 about	 harming	 and	 about
destructive	 impulses.	 This	 can	 interfere	 with
normal	 child	 development	 and	 even	 in	 adult	 life
cause	 a	 regression	 back	 to	 the	 paranoid-schizoid
position.
The	 point	 is	 that	 although	 reparation	 is
concerned	 with	 the	 good	 object	 in	 the	 internal
world,	it	is	expressed	in	action	toward	objects	in
the	external	world	that	represent	the	phantasied
damaged	internal	object.	It	is	this	that	makes	it	a
force	for	constructive	action	in	the	external	world
and	enhances	a	love	relationship,	since	it	focuses
on	the	repair	of	the	troubles	or	difficulties	of	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1117
loved	object.

REPETITION	COMPULSION
(see	COMPULSION	TO	REPEAT)
REPRESSION
Repression	was	the	initial	and	most	important
mechanism	 of	 defense	 described	 by	 Freud.	 It
functions	 to	 render	 and	 keep	 an	 unacceptable
impulse	 or	 idea	 unconscious.	 Freud	 (1914)
declared	 that	 the	 theory	 of	 repression	 is	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1118
cornerstone	 on	 which	 the	 whole	 structure	 of
psychoanalysis	
rests,	
and	
his	
concept	
of
repression	 goes	 back	 historically	 to	 the	 very
beginning	of	psychoanalysis.	Since	Freud’s	notion
of	 repression	 changed	 gradually,	 the	 reader
sometimes	becomes	confused	as	to	what	he	means
by	the	term	repression.
Freud’s	 (1915b)	 brief	 paper	 on	 repression	 is
one	 of	 his	 early	 works	 on	 metapsychology	 and
begins	 by	 defining	 repression	 as	 an	 instinctual
vicissitude,	 one	 of	 the	 resistances	 that	 seeks	 to
make	
an	
instinctual	
impulse	
inoperative.
Repression	
is	
a	
preliminary	
stage	
of
condemnation,	 “something	 between	 flight	 and
condemnation”	 (p.	 146).	 According	 to	 Freud,
repression	 is	 not	 a	 defense	 mechanism	 present
from	the	very	beginning	and	cannot	arise	until	a
cleavage	 has	 occurred	 between	 conscious	 and
unconscious	 mental	 activity.	 When	 the	 need	 to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1119
avoid	 pain	 is	 greater	 than	 the	 pleasure	 of
gratification,	 repression	 occurs,	 and	 its	 essence
“lies	 simply	 in	 turning	 something	 away,	 and
keeping	 it	 at	 a	 distance,	 from	 the	 conscious”	 (p.
147).	Before	the	mental	organization	achieves	the
cleavage	 between	 conscious	 and	 unconscious
mental	
activity,	
the	
task	
of	
fending	
off
unacceptable	 instincts	 is	 dealt	 with	 by	 the	 other
vicissitudes	 that	 instincts	 may	 undergo,	 such	 as
reversal	into	the	opposite	or	turning	around	upon
the	subject’s	own	self.
Freud	then	introduces	one	of	the	most	difficult
of	his	concepts,	that	of	primal	repression,	in	which
the	ideational	representative	of	the	instinct	is	from
the	
beginning	
denied	
entrance	
into	
the
preconscious	 or	 conscious.	 At	 this	 point,	 astute
psychiatric	 residents	 (in	 those	 few	 training
programs	that	still	study	Freud)	usually	ask	how
there	can	be	ideational	content	to	an	instinct	if	it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1120
never	reaches	the	preconscious	or	consciousness.
Primal	repression	is	a	hypothetical	construct	that
seems	to	confuse	the	theory.	One	way	to	look	at	it
is	 to	 realize	 that	 Freud	 is	 talking	 about
unstructured	 rudimentary	 ideational	 material	 or
pre-ego	 impulses	 that	 are	 simply	 left	 behind	 or
outside	 consciousness	 as	 the	 ego	 develops,	 and
thus	can	never	be	subjected	to	secondary	process.
However,	this	answer	is	not	very	satisfactory.
At	this	point,	even	more	astute	residents	may
ask	how	such	material	can	be	kept	in	repression	if
there	 is	 no	 countercathexis.	 Here	 again	 we	 must
say	that	this	rudimentary	unstructured	material	is
simply	 left	 out	 as	 the	 ego	 forms	 its	 structure.
Philosophers	immediately	argue	that	this	is	one	of
those	 concepts	 that	 cannot	 be	 proven	 and	 can
never	 be	 known,	 since	 if	 it	 could	 be	 known,	 by
definition	 it	 would	 not	 be	 in	 a	 state	 of	 primal
repression.	 In	 Freud’s	 early	 notion	 of	 primal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1121
repression,	 we	 are	 dealing	 fundamentally	 with	 a
metaphysical	concept,	a	target	for	Ockham’s	razor.
Freud	(1915b)	next	defines	repression	proper,
in	which	mental	derivatives	of	repressed	instincts
or	associated	with	repressed	instincts	are	expelled
into	the	unconscious.	He	insists	that	this	material
must	be	connected	to	primally	repressed	material,
which	 has	 a	 magnetic	 attraction	 and	 draws	 its
derivatives	 into	 the	 id:	 “Repression	 proper,
therefore,	 is	 actually	 an	 after-pressure”	 (p.	 148).
Repression	 proper	 occurs	 not	 only	 because	 of	 a
repulsion	that	operates	from	the	direction	of	the
conscious	 upon	 the	 unacceptable	 instinct;	 “quite
as	 important	 is	 the	 attraction	 exercised	 by	 what
was	 primally	 repressed	 upon	 everything	 with
which	 it	 can	 establish	 a	 connection”	 (p.	 148).
Freud	believes	that	repression	would	probably	fail
in	 its	 purpose	 if	 there	 were	 not	 something
previously	 repressed	 ready	 to	 “receive”	 what	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1122
repelled	by	the	preconscious.
Not	 everything	 that	 is	 related	 to	 what	 was
primally	repressed	is	withheld	from	the	conscious;
some	 derivatives	 get	 through,	 but	 they	 are	 far
enough	 disguised	 and	 removed.	 Repression	 can
even	receive	a	transitory	lifting,	as,	for	example,	in
jokes.
Freud	 (1915b)	 proceeds	 to	 make	 one	 of	 his
most	 important	 clinical	 observations.	 Repressed
instinctual	representatives	proliferate	in	the	dark,
as	 he	 puts	 it,	 and	 take	 on	 extreme	 forms	 of
expression	 that	 seem	 alien	 to	 the	 patient	 and
actually	frighten	him	or	her	by	posing	the	picture
of	 extraordinary	 and	 dangerous	 strength	 of
instinctual	 forces:	 “This	 deceptive	 strength	 of
instinct	
is	
the	
result	
of	
an	
uninhibited
development	 in	 fantasy	 and	 of	 the	 damming-up
consequent	on	frustrated	satisfaction”	(p.	149).	In
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1123
the	 neuroses	 there	 is	 great	 fear	 of	 various
repressed	 instinctual	 derivatives,	 but	 when	 they
have	 become	 exposed	 to	 the	 light	 in	 intensive
psychotherapy	 they	 appear	 silly	 and	 relatively
harmless.	It	is	a	serious	failure	of	empathy	on	the
part	 of	 the	 psychotherapist	 to	 assume	 that
apparently	 minor	 wishes	 of	 an	 infantile	 nature
should	 be	 as	 ridiculous	 to	 the	 patient	 as	 they
obviously	are	to	the	therapist,	and	to	ridicule	such
infantile	desires.	To	the	patient	these	are	threats
of	the	greatest	magnitude	coming	from	within,	and
much	of	his	or	her	personality	has	been	developed
to	protect	against	what	he	or	she	considers	to	be
explosive	or	catastrophically	destructive	ideation
and	wishes.	It	is	only	after	a	successful	treatment
that	 patients	 can	 look	 back	 on	 their	 unconscious
ideation	and	regard	it	as	a	harmless	set	of	infantile
phenomena.	In	fact,	when	patients	begin	to	snicker
at	 their	 own	 infantile	 wishes	 we	 know	 that	 they
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1124
are	
often	
making	
good	
progress	
in	
the
psychotherapy.
The	entire	notion	of	dynamic	psychiatry	rests
on	 the	 concept	 of	 repression.	 Freud	 (1915b)
explains	 that	 the	 repressed	 (repression	 proper)
exerts	 a	 continuous	 pressure	 in	 the	 direction	 of
the	 conscious	 that	 must	 be	 balanced	 by	 an
unceasing	counter	pressure;	thus	the	maintenance
of	
repression	
involves	
an	
uninterrupted
expenditure	of	force,	and	its	removal	results	in	a
saving	
of	
energy.	
Similarly,	
whenever	
an
unacceptable	 idea	 acquires	 a	 certain	 degree	 of
energy	 or	 strength,	 this	 activation	 leads	 to
repression;	thus	a	substitute	for	repression	would
be	a	weakening,	by	indirect	discharge,	of	what	is
distasteful.	Notice	that	both	the	energic	charge	of
affect	 and	 the	 ideational	 presentation	 of	 the
instinct	
undergo	
a	
fate—	
the	
former	
is
transformed	 and	 the	 latter	 is	 repressed.	 At	 this
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1125
point	Freud	still	thought	of	anxiety	as	the	result	of
the	 transformation	 of	 these	 affects	 into	 anxiety.
Two	other	possible	fates	for	the	affect	are	either
total	suppression	so	that	no	trace	of	it	is	found	or
“it	 appears	 as	 an	 affect	 which	 is	 in	 some	 way	 or
other	qualitatively	colored”	(p.	153),	that	is	diluted
or	altered.
The	implication	of	this	theory	seems	to	be	that
ordinary	 ideas	 always	 go	 first	 through	 the
unconscious	 and	 then	 move	 into	 the	 higher
integrated	areas	of	conscious	mental	function.	The
lower	 systems	 of	 mentation	 must	 therefore
cathect	 the	 higher	 ones	 for	 the	 perception	 of	 an
idea—or	 even	 of	 an	 external	 stimulus—to	 reach
consciousness.	 The	 id	 thus	 retains	 or	 attracts
certain	 perceptions	 where	 the	 cathexes	 are,	 and
much	 elaboration	 has	 to	 occur	 before	 conscious
perceptions	 take	 place	 (see	 CONSCIOUSNESS).
Freud	 (1915b)	 explains,	 “The	 mechanism	 of	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1126
repression	 becomes	 accessible	 to	 us	 only	 by	 our
deducing	that	mechanism	from	the	outcome	of	the
repression”	(p.	154).	In	this	theory,	symptoms	are
substitutive	formations	that	represent	the	return
of	 the	 repressed,	 and	 thus	 the	 mechanism	 of
forming	 symptoms	 is	 not	 the	 same	 as	 that	 of
repression.	The	paper	concludes	with	examples	of
symptom	
formation	
in	
the	
various
psychoneuroses.
The	 distinction	 between	 repression	 and
disavowal,	or	denial	(Verleugnung),	was	first	made
in	Freud’s	(1927)	paper	on	fetishism.	Disavowal	as
the	ego’s	reaction	to	an	intolerable	external	reality
was	further	developed	in	some	of	Freud’s	(1940)
later	writings,	especially	chapter	8	of	An	Outline	of
Psychoanalysis.	 Recent	 studies	 of	 preoedipal
pathology	 and	 narcissistic	 personality	 disorders
have	 brought	 this	 distinction	 into	 focus,	 (see
DENIAL,	DISAVOWAL).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1127
Brenner	 (1957).	 distinguishes	 four	 stages	 at
which	 Freud	 made	 important	 innovations	 in	 or
significant	additions	to	the	concept	of	repression.
In	 the	 first	 stage	 (1894-1896),	 repression	 was
thought	 of	 as	 a	 pathological	 mental	 process	 in
which	 memories	 of	 a	 painful	 nature	 were
suppressed	 in	 individuals	 who	 had	 a	 sexual
experience	 in	 childhood—an	 experience	 that,
“though	 pleasurable	 at	 the	 time	 it	 occurred,	 had
been	later	considered	bad	or	shameful	and	whose
memory	 had	 consequently	 been	 repressed”	 (p.
23).
In	 the	 second	 stage	 (1900-1906),	 repression
was	thought	of	as	occurring	in	normal	as	well	as
neurotic	
individuals,	
and	
infantile	
(primal)
repression	was	a	consequence	of	sequences	in	the
maturation	of	the	psychic	apparatus	and	was	the
precondition	of	later	repressions.	Thus	a	store	of
infantile	 memories	 and	 wishes	 that	 never	 had
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1128
been	 and	 never	 would	 be	 accessible	 to	 the
preconscious	constituted	the	infantile	core	of	the
repressed.	
Brenner	
(1957)	
explains,	
“This
formulation	was	in	accord	with	Freud’s	experience
that	 infantile	 memories	 and	 wishes	 were	 not
recoverable	 or	 rememberable	 as	 such	 in	 later
years	 and	 that	 their	 existence	 has	 to	 be	 inferred
from	their	effects	on	mental	life,	notably	in	dreams
and	 neurotic	 symptoms”	 (p.	 27).	 As	 explained
above,	 this	 store	 of	 inaccessible	 memories	 was
thought	 to	 be	 the	 precondition	 of	 all	 later
instances	of	repression;	the	conscious	has	to	turn
away	 from	 any	 derivatives	 of	 such	 infantile
memories.	A	vague	notion	of	an	organic	factor	in
repression	 was	 introduced	 at	 this	 time	 but	 was
largely	neglected	in	Freud’s	later	writings.
The	 theories	 of	 the	 third	 stage	 (1911-1915)
were	 put	 forward	 in	 the	 paper	 on	 repression
described	 above	 and	 in	 “The	 Unconscious”
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1129
(1915a).	 Here,	 repression	 is	 still	 seen	 as	 an
immature	 mechanism	 that	 is	 replaced	 in	 the
process	 of	 psychotherapy	 or	 psychoanalysis	 by
conscious	
judgment	
and	
condemnation	
of
unacceptable	impulses.
The	final	stage	(1923-1939)	was	necessitated
by	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 structural	 theory	 of
mind	 and	 the	 signal	 theory	 of	 anxiety	 (see
ANXIETY).	 Anxiety	 is	 now	 thought	 of	 as	 the
predecessor	and	motive	for	repression;	the	signal
of	anxiety	arises	as	the	anticipation	of	danger	from
intrapsychic	 conflict	 and	 of	 flooding	 due	 to	 the
intensity	of	stimuli.	Although	Freud	did	not	make	a
full	final	statement	on	the	subject,	upon	shifting	to
the	structural	theory	he	seems	to	have	concluded
that	of	several	defense	mechanisms,	repression	is
the	 one	 the	 ego	 immediately	 employs	 against	 an
instinctual	drive	that	is	the	source	of	anxiety.	The
mechanism	 of	 repression	 is	 now	 seen	 as	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1130
establishment	of	a	countercathexis	by	the	ego,	and
therefore	a	substantial	degree	of	ego	development
must	take	place	before	this	can	occur.	The	notion
of	 primal	 repression	 shifts	 to	 represent	 early
infantile	 repressions	 that	 occur	 by	 the	 same
mechanism	and	are	quite	basic;	later	repressions
are	 by	 and	 large	 repetitions	 or	 consequences	 of
the	
infantile	
ones.	
The	
earlier	
conceptual
distinction	
between	
primal	
repression	
and
repression	proper	fades	away.
Brenner	(1957)	mentions	certain	other	aspects
of	 the	 later	 theory	 of	 repression.	 Between	 the
repressed	drive	and	the	countercathexis	of	the	ego
an	 equilibrium	 is	 established	 that	 may	 shift,	 for
example,	 when	 (1)	 the	 defenses	 of	 the	 ego	 are
weakened,	as	by	illness	or	sleep;	(2)	when	drives
are	 strengthened,	 as	 in	 puberty	 or	 chronic
frustration;	
and	
(3)	
when	
there	
is	
“a
correspondence	 between	 the	 content	 of	 current
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1131
experience	 and	 of	 the	 repressed	 drive”	 (p.	 45).
Repression	 is	 potentially	 pathogenic	 in	 that	 it
produces	 a	 crippling	 of	 the	 instinctual	 life	 and	 a
constriction	of	the	sphere	of	influence	of	the	ego,
as	well	as	a	continuing	drain	on	the	ego’s	store	of
available	psychic	energy.

RESISTANCE
Resistance	
represents	
the	
opposition
encountered	to	the	psychoanalytic	work	of	making
unconscious	 processes	 conscious.	 Patients	 may
oppose	the	analyst’s	interpretations	or	behave	in
such	a	way	as	to	make	the	work	difficult	or	take
certain	attitudes	toward	the	treatment,	including
avoiding	free	association.
Resistance	 is	 understood	 as	 a	 function	 of	 the
ego’s	 defensive	 efforts	 to	 keep	 in	 repression
unacceptable	 childhood	 wishes,	 fantasies,	 and
impulses.	 In	 his	 early	 work	 (Breuer	 and	 Freud
1893-1895)	 Freud	 conceived	 of	 resistance	 as	 an
obstacle	 to	 be	 overcome	 by	 every	 method	 the
doctor	 had	 at	 his	 disposal,	 including	 suggestion,
authority,	 persuasion,	 and	 the	 power	 of	 the
relationship.	The	removal	of	resistance	was	from
the	 beginning	 considered	 the	 central	 task	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1133
psychoanalytic	treatment.	In	Minutes	of	the	Vienna
Psychoanalytic	 Society	 (Nunberg	 and	 Federn
1962),	Freud	is	noted	by	Rank	as	saying,	“There	is
only	one	power	which	can	remove	the	resistances,
the	transference.	The	patient	is	compelled	to	give
up	his	resistances	to	please	us.	Our	cures	are	cures
of	 love.	 …	 The	 vicissitudes	 of	 the	 transference
decide	 the	 success	 of	 the	 treatment”	 (pp.	 100-
102).	Freud	regarded	the	notions	of	resistance	and
transference	 as	 the	 conceptual	 hallmarks	 of
psychoanalysis.	
We	
now	
understand	
that
transference	 can	 be	 a	 source	 of	 resistance	 (see
TRANSFERENCE).
Once	a	patient	has	agreed	to	the	basic	contract
and	has	attempted	to	express	whatever	comes	to
mind,	 certain	 phenomena	 soon	 appear	 that
interrupt	 and	 interfere	 with	 the	 steady	 flow	 of
thoughts,	 associations,	 feelings,	 and	 memories.
These	various	phenomena	are	collectively	termed
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1134
resistance.	Acting	out	is	a	particularly	pernicious
form	 of	 resistance	 because	 it	 can	 break	 up	 the
therapy.	 Freud	 (1900)	 defined	 resistance	 as
anything	 that	 interrupts	 the	 progress	 of	 analytic
work.	 He	 (1926)	 distinguished	 five	 kinds	 of
resistance	 and	 classified	 them	 according	 to	 their
source:
1.	The	resistance	of	repression	(the	resistance	of
the	ego’s	defenses).
2.	
Resistance	
of	
the	
transference.	
Since
transference	 is	 a	 substitute	 for	 memory
and	is	based	on	a	displacement	from	past
objects	
onto	
present	
objects,	
Freud
classified	 this	 resistance	 as	 also	 derived
from	the	ego.
3.	The	gain	from	illness,	or	secondary	gain,	was
also	placed	by	Freud	under	ego	resistance.
4.	The	repetition	compulsion	(see	COMPULSION
TO	REPEAT).	Freud	at	first	attributed	this
to	
adhesiveness	
of	
the	
libido	
(see
ADHESIVENESS	 OF	 THE	 LIBIDO)	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1135
considered	 it	 as	 stemming	 from	 the	 id.
Later	 he	 explained	 id	 resistance	 as	 a
function	of	the	death	instinct	(see	DEATH
INSTINCT).
5.	Resistances	that	arise	from	unconscious	guilt
and	 a	 need	 for	 punishment.	 These
originate	in	the	superego.
It	is	useful	to	divide	resistances	into	ego-alien
and	 ego-syntonic.	 The	 ego-alien	 resistances
appear	 foreign,	 extraneous,	 and	 strange	 to	 the
patient’s	 reasonable	 ego;	 as	 a	 consequence,	 such
resistances	 are	 relatively	 easy	 to	 recognize	 and
work	
with.	
In	
contrast,	
the	
ego-syntonic
resistances	 are	 characterized	 by	 their	 seeming
familiarity,	rationality,	and	purposefulness	to	the
patient.	The	patient	does	not	sense	the	resistance
function	 of	 the	 activity	 under	 scrutiny.	 Such
resistances	 are	 harder	 to	 recognize	 and	 more
difficult	to	work	with.	They	are	sometimes	called
defense	 transferences.	 Greenson	 (1968)	 explains
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1136
that	 they	 usually	 represent	 well-established
habitual	 behavior	 patterns	 of	 the	 patient	 and
character	 traits,	 sometimes	 of	 social	 value.	 He
places	 reaction	 formations,	 acting	 out,	 character
resistances,	 counterphobic	 attitudes,	 and	 screen
defenses	in	this	category.
The	
working	
through	
of	
ego-syntonic
resistances	is	difficult.	Such	resistances	must	first
be	made	ego-alien	for	the	patient	before	they	can
be	dealt	with.	The	therapist’s	task,	notes	Greenson,
will	 be	 first	 to	 help	 the	 patient	 establish	 a
reasonable	 ego	 in	 regard	 to	 the	 particular
resistance.	 When	 the	 patient	 can	 understand	 the
historical	reasons	for	the	origin	of	the	resistance
defense,	 the	 patient	 will	 be	 able	 to	 differentiate
past	 needs	 for	 that	 defense	 and	 the	 present
inappropriateness	of	the	defense.
It	 is	 clear	 that	 the	 psychotherapy	 must	 deal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1137
first	with	the	patient’s	resistances	and	only	second
with	content,	and	it	is	surprising	how	frequently
this	 is	 violated.	 Unless	 resistances	 are	 removed
first,	 interpretations	 of	 content	 will	 lead	 to
nothing.	 It	 is	 usual	 to	 begin	 with	 ego-alien
resistances.	Although	the	ego-syntonic	resistances
are	present	from	the	beginning,	it	is	pointless	to
begin	 by	 attacking	 them,	 since	 the	 patient	 will
simply	deny	their	significance	or	give	lip	service	to
understanding.
Transference	resistance	may	take	the	form	of
defenses	 against	 awareness	 of	 the	 transference.
When	the	transference	becomes	conscious,	wishes
and	 attitudes	 may	 become	 so	 intense	 that	 they
disrupt	 the	 treatment.	 A	 transference	 defense
represents	 the	 establishment	 of	 a	 transference
with	 its	 set	 of	 wishes	 and	 attitudes	 as	 a	 defense
against	 another	 transference	 with	 an	 even	 more
unacceptable	 set	 of	 wishes	 and	 attitudes	 (see
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1138
TRANSFERENCE).	
Transference	
is	
often
considered	 a	 form	 of	 resistance	 because	 it
expresses	 the	 wish	 for	 direct	 gratification	 and
acting	out	rather	than	the	proper	task	of	analysis,
i.e.,	remembering	and	analyzing	the	origins	of	the
transference	in	past	relations.
Resistances	 in	 intensive	 psychotherapy	 or
psychoanalysis	are	understood	differently	by	self
psychologists	 (Kohut	 1984).	 Self	 psychologists
interpret	 resistances	 as	 manifestations	 of	 the
patient’s	fear	of	“humiliation	or	rejection	or	some
other	 form	 of	 depreciation,”	 and	 this	 fear	 makes
them	“sensitively	cautious”	against	self-revelation,
explains	 Wolf	 (Stepansky	 and	 Goldberg	 1984,	 p.
152).	 This	 caution	 does	 not	 represent	 defense
against	 the	 drive	 but	 against	 selfobject	 failures
that	 may	 fragment	 the	 self.	 Wolf	 calls	 these
“measures	of	obligatory	self-protection.”	He	feels
that	 a	 patient	 should	 not	 be	 labeled	 borderline
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1139
until	 there	 have	 been	 trials	 of	 analysis	 “by	 more
than	 one	 or	 two	 analysts”	 (p.	 153),	 because	 he
believes	the	disruptions	in	the	treatment	of	these
patients	 can	 often	 be	 brought	 to	 an	 end	 “by
interpretation	and	explanation”	(p.	155),	allowing
a	stable	selfobject	relationship	to	form	eventually.
The	skill	and	emphatic	attunement	of	the	analyst
are	very	important.
There	 are	 at	 least	 two	 potential	 traumas	 to
which	 the	 self	 is	 exposed:	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 needed
selfobject	 response	 and	 the	 intrusion	 of	 the
selfobject	across	its	boundaries	into	its	own	core.
Wolf	 explains	 that	 “the	 more	 fragile	 the	 self
structure,	 the	 more	 vulnerable	 the	 self	 and	 the
more	 distorted	 the	 self	 s	 defensive	 maneuvers
against	 the	 potential	 danger”	 (p.	 152).	 From	 the
point	 of	 view	 of	 self	 psychology,	 the	 more	 the
therapist	learns	about	his	or	her	patient-assigned
function	as	a	selfobject	in	the	treatment,	the	better
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1140
the	therapist	will	be	at	practicing	psychotherapy,
and	the	more	“resistances”	can	be	understood	and
analyzed	correctly.

REVERIE
(BION)
Wilfred	 Bion	 (1897-1979),	 an	 extraordinarily
intuitive	
analysand	
and	
follower	
of	
Klein,
described	the	state	of	mind	that	an	infant	requires
of	the	mother	as	“reverie”	(Bion	1967).	This	is	a
state	of	calm	receptiveness	established	to	contain
the	
infant’s	
feelings.	
Through	
projective
identification	 the	 infant	 inserts	 into	 the	 mind	 of
the	mother	a	state	of	anxiety	that	it	is	unable	to
make	 sense	 of	 and	 is	 considered	 intolerable.
Mother’s	 reverie	 allows	 the	 alpha	 function	 (see
ALPHA	
FUNCTION)	
to	
operate,	
translating
confused	 and	 projected	 sense	 data,	 or	 beta
elements,	 from	 the	 infant	 into	 some	 sort	 of
meaning.	
By	
introjecting	
this	
receptive
understanding	 mother,	 the	 infant	 begins	 to
develop	 the	 capacity	 for	 reflection	 and	 ego
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1142
structuring.
If	the	mother	is	incapable	of	reverie,	the	infant
cannot	 receive	 a	 sense	 of	 meaning	 from	 her	 and
experiences	 instead	 a	 sense	 of	 meaning	 having
been	stripped	away	with	a	terrifying	sense	of	the
ghastly	unknown	that	Bion	(1967)	calls	“nameless
dread.”	 Beta	 elements	 then	 accumulate,	 and	 the
mind	develops	into	an	apparatus	for	getting	rid	of
these	accumulations	rather	than	for	thinking.	This
is	 important	 to	 an	 impressive	 understanding	 of
schizophrenia	offered	by	Bion.
If	 the	 mother’s	 mind	 is	 cluttered	 with	 other
worries,	 she	 is	 absent	 for	 the	 infant	 and	 is
inadequate	as	an	external	object	or	container.	But
the	 infant’s	 own	 envy	 may	 cause	 it	 to	 attack	 the
very	 containing	 function	 upon	 which	 it	 depends.
Too	much	envy	may	be	projected	into	the	mother
and	 render	 her	 an	 envious	 container,	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1143
unfortunate	 phantasy	 that	 deprives	 what	 the
mother	has	to	offer	of	any	meaning.	Finally,	as	any
pediatrician	 knows,	 the	 mother	 may	 be	 a	 fragile
container	 of	 projections	 and	 collapse	 under	 the
force	of	projective	identifications	from	the	infant.
The	analytic	situation	could	be	described	as	an
endeavor	 to	 provide	 a	 bounded	 calm	 world	 or
container	where	meaning	(the	contained)	can	be
developed	 or	 found	 (Bion	 1962).	 This	 is
sometimes	thought	of	as	a	“toilet	function”	of	the
analyst,	 but	 it	 also	 involves	 returning	 the
projected	elements	in	a	metabolized	and	articulate
form,	similar	to	the	mother’s	alpha	function.
Etchegoyen	(1991)	offers	an	excellent	review
of	Bion’s	container-contained	theory.	Transferring
this	to	the	psychoanalytic	process	itself,	he	views
the	 analyst	 at	 one	 stage	 of	 the	 treatment	 as	 a
container	 of	 the	 analysand’s	 anxieties:	 “The
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1144
fundamental	 analytic	 task	 at	 this	 stage	 is	 the
analyst’s	 containment	 and	 interpretation	 of	 the
patient’s	anxiety.	To	the	extent	that	this	process	is
carried	 out,	 if	 the	 patient	 deposits	 or,	 rather,
evacuates	his	anxiety	…	and	the	analyst	is	able	to
bear	 it,	 a	 type	 of	 relationship	 is	 established	 in
which	 the	 patient	 feels	 the	 analyst	 as	 an	 object
whose	 function	 is	 to	 contain	 him”	 (p.	 611).
Etchegoyen	approves	of	Meltzer’s	idea	that	as	this
containing	 function	 or	 “toilet-breast”	 operates	 in
the	analyst,	the	analysand	will	develop	a	growing
confidence	 and	 gradually	 introject	 this	 function.
When	 this	 occurs	 the	 patient	 now	 has	 within	 an
object	 where	 he	 or	 she	 can	 deposit	 his	 or	 her
anxieties.	 It	 is	 interesting	 to	 compare	 this
explanation	of	the	growing	capacity	of	the	patient
for	 tension	 regulation	 with	 Kohut’s	 concept	 of
transmuting	
internalization	
(see	
SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).

REVERSIBLE	PERSPECTIVE
Bion	(1963)	introduced	this	concept	to	denote
a	 drastic	 attempt	 to	 destabilize	 the	 analytic
situation	 through	 a	 remarkable	 reversal	 of	 the
processes	 of	 thought	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 patient.
Etchegoyen	(1991)	offers	an	excellent	summary	of
this	
maneuver,	
which	
has	
great	
clinical
importance	and	does	not	receive	the	attention	that
it	 deserves.	 Etchegoyen	 reworks	 the	 concept	 to

apply	 to	 borderline	 and	 even	 severely	 neurotic
patients,	whereas	Bion	thought	of	it	as	pertaining
more	 to	 psychotics.	 In	 my	 clinical	 experience,	 I
have	 found	 it	 in	 borderline	 and	 severe	 character
disorders.
The	 patient	 silently,	 either	 consciously	 or
unconsciously,	
experiences	
the	
entire
psychoanalysis	 from	 a	 different	 set	 of	 premises
than	 those	 held	 by	 the	 therapist.	 The	 analytic
contract	is	actually	violated,	although	the	patient
appears	on	the	surface	to	be	cooperating	with	the
treatment.	 A	 mental	 disposition	 underlying
reversible	 perspective	 has	 to	 do	 with	 these
premises.	Etchegoyen	explains,	“He	[the	patient]	is
continuously	
reinterpreting	
the	
analyst’s
interpretations	 so	 that	 they	 can	 blend	 with	 his
own	premises,	which	is	also	a	way	of	saying	that
the	analyst’s	premises	have	to	be	silently	rejected
—silently,	because	between	analyst	and	analysand
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1147
there	 is	 manifest	 accord	 and	 latent	 discord,	 of
which	 the	 analyst	 usually	 becomes	 aware	 only
when	 he	 realizes	 that	 the	 process	 is	 completely
stagnant”	
(p.	
759).	
The	
clinical	
example
Etchegoyen	 offers	 is	 that	 of	 a	 homeopathic
physician	
who	
ostensibly	
came	
seeking
psychoanalytic	treatment	for	anxiety	and	crises	of
depersonalization	 as	 well	 as	 hoping	 for	 a
modification	
of	
the	
psychological	
factors
contributing	to	his	bronchial	asthma.	Actually,	the
patient	was	guided	by	professional	rivalry	and	not
by	 any	 desire	 to	 be	 cured.	 He	 simply	 wanted	 to
reassure	himself	that	the	method	of	homeopathic
medicine	 was	 superior	 to	 the	 method	 of
psychoanalysis.
Reversible	 perspective	 is	 often	 operative	 in
patients	 who	 are	 chronically	 late.	 Such	 patients
are	 often	 using	 the	 psychoanalytic	 process	 to
prove	 something	 rather	 than	 for	 the	 purpose	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1148
cure.	In	those	situations,	as	Etchegoyen	explains,
“To	interpret	at	the	level	of	defense	mechanisms	is
not	 enough.	 Because	 as	 long	 as	 one	 interprets
lateness	 or	 silence	 in	 terms	 of	 fear,	 frustration,
revenge,	 envy,	 Oedipus	 complex,	 castration
anxiety,	omnipotent	control	or	whatever,	one	has
not	 reached	 the	 level	 at	 which	 the	 conflict	 is
rooted”	(p.	766).
The	 reversion	 of	 perspective	 should	 be
suspected	when	everything	seems	to	be	going	well
in	the	treatment	but	no	change	is	taking	place	in
the	
analysand.	
This	
is	
not	
an	
infrequent
occurrence	in	training	analyses,	where	the	analyst
thinks	he	is	helping	the	patient	to	resolve	neurotic
difficulties	but	the	patient,	a	candidate	analyst,	is
simply	intending	to	use	the	training	analysis	as	a
source	of	borrowed	knowledge	and	accreditation.
This	is	an	example	of	reversible	perspective	that
often	appears	in	narcissistic	personality	disorders;
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1149
the	 most	 extreme	 example	 is	 the	 patient	 who
enters	analysis	not	in	order	to	be	cured	of	neurotic
difficulties	but	to	demonstrate	to	the	analyst	that
he	or	she	does	not	need	analysis!	One	sometimes
sees	a	similar	situation	when	analyzing	colleagues
in	 the	 mental	 health	 profession	 who	 attempt	 to
use	 the	 analysis	 to	 “teach”	 the	 analyst	 that	 the
analyst’s	theoretical	orientation	is	incorrect	and	to
persuade	 the	 analyst	 to	 adopt	 the	 analysand’s
theoretical	orientation!

into	which	the	original	pristine	ego	becomes	split
(see	 QUASI-INDEPENDENCE	 for	 an	 outline	 of

energy	strives	for	self-development.	His	work	gets
into	 difficulty	 because	 he	 assumes	 that	 the	 ego
becomes	split	in	all	development,	normal	as	well
as	 pathological.	 Fairbairn	 uses	 the	 term	 “ego”	 to

SADISM,
SADOMASOCHISM
(see	also	MASOCHISM)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1153
The	Marquis	de	Sade	(1740-1814)	described	in
great	 detail	 the	 pleasures	 he	 obtained	 in	 his
fantasy	 life	 of	 inflicting	 cruelty	 on	 others.	 He	 is
mentioned	 by	 a	 number	 of	 thinkers,	 such	 as
Foucault	(1973),	as	one	of	the	“mad	artists”	that
herald	the	breakdown	of	our	era.	The	term	sadism
comes	from	his	name.
Sadism	 is	 easy	 to	 define,	 but	 there	 is
considerable	 controversy	 as	 to	 its	 source	 or
sources.	It	can	be	thought	of	as	a	sexual	perversion
in	 which	 pleasure	 comes	 from	 inflicting	 pain	 on
the	object	or	more	generally,	pleasure	in	cruelty.
The	 sexual	 significance	 of	 sadistic	 wishes	 or
behavior	 may	 not	 be	 consciously	 known	 to	 the
individual.	 Some	 authors	 speak	 of	 “oral	 sadism,”
most	manifest	during	the	second	half	of	the	first
year	of	life,	during	which	the	teeth	develop	and	the
infant	 gets	 pleasure	 in	 biting,	 and	 anal	 sadism,	 a
phase	during	the	early	second	year	of	life	in	which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1154
there	 is	 pleasure	 in	 smearing,	 dirtying,	 and
directly	inflicting	pain.
The	debate	about	sadism	is	over	whether	it	is
the	 manifestation	 of	 an	 instinctual	 drive	 or
whether	
it	
arises	
only	
secondarily	
as	
a
disintegration	 of	 normal	 assertiveness	 due	 to
frustration.	
This	
argument	
is	
actually	
an
outgrowth	 of	 an	 old	 theological	 controversy,
which	may	be	found	not	only	in	early	Christianity
but	even	among	the	followers	of	Confucius,	as	to
whether	 or	 not	 humans	 are	 innately	 evil.	 Freud
(1920)	 explained	 sadism	 in	 his	 later	 work	 as	 a
manifestation	of	the	death	instinct	turned	outward
(see	DEATH	INSTINCT).	 Although	 Freud	 was	 not
consistent	 about	 this,	 Melanie	 Klein	 based	 her
entire	theories	on	it	(see	KLEIN).	Kohut	(see	SELF
PSYCHOLOGY)	was	convinced	of	the	opposite,	that
sadism	 when	 it	 appears	 is	 an	 indication	 of
fragmentation	 of	 the	 sense	 of	 self	 and	 is	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1155
disintegration	 product	 rather	 than	 anything
indigenous	 to	 the	 individual	 or	 a	 primary	 drive.
This	 view	 was	 shared	 by	 Fromm,	 Fairbairn,	 and
others	who	came	before	Kohut.
The	classic	interpretation	of	sexual	sadism	was
that	it	defended	the	individual	against	castration
fears.	 This	 would	 then	 be	 a	 form	 of	 secondary
sadism,	a	derivative	from	conflict,	and	would	have
to	 be	 differentiated	 from	 some	 sort	 of	 primary
primitive	instinctual	destructive	urges	postulated
to	reside	in	the	id	and	originally	turned	against	the
individual	as	the	death	instinct.	Not	all	of	the	death
instinct	 is	 turned	 toward	 others,	 according	 to
Freud,	and	some	of	it	remains	within	the	organism
as	a	sort	of	primal	sadism,	the	source	of	erotogenic
masochism.	 Some	 authors	 use	 the	 concept	 of
phallic	 sadism,	 in	 which	 the	 phallus	 becomes
associated	 with	 aggressive	 and	 violent	 impulses
during	 the	 phallic	 phase	 of	 development.	 Many
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1156
manifestations	 of	 this	 are	 found	 in	 the	 never-
ending	stream	of	movies	dealing	with	overcoming
castration	fears	by	overexaggerating	the	penis	or
employing	 penis	 symbols	 as	 powerful	 and
aggressive	weapons	of	violence	and	destruction.
For	 psychotherapists,	 the	 most	 important
aspect	 of	 sadism	 is	 in	 the	 so-called	 sadistic
superego	(see	SPLITTING).	The	early	precursors	of
the	 superego	 are	 infused	 with	 oral	 and	 anal
sadistic	
drive	
derivatives.	
Patients	
with
depressions	 and	 obsessive-compulsive	 disorders
exhibit	
an	
extremely	
punitive,	
rigid,	
and
destructive	superego	that	drives	them	relentlessly.
The	standard	attempt	to	modify	this	superego
comes	
from	
mutative	
interpretations	
(see
MUTATIVE	 INTERPRETATION).	 The	 essence	 of
this	technique	is	the	hope	of	replacing	the	harsh
punitive	 superego	 of	 the	 patient	 with	 an
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1157
introjection	 of	 the	 more	 benign	 and	 tolerant
aspect	 of	 the	 therapist.	 This	 comes	 about,
theoretically	 speaking,	 through	 the	 projection	 of
the	harsh	punitive	superego	onto	the	therapist	and
then	 proper	 interpretation,	 which	 brings	 the
patient	 to	 an	 awareness	 of	 the	 reality	 of	 the
situation	and	an	understanding	of	what	has	been
projected.	 This	 leads	 to	 improved	 reality	 testing
and	an	incorporation	of	the	therapist	as	a	benign
introject.	 In	 actual	 practice	 this	 is	 much	 more
difficult	than	it	appears	to	be,	because	this	harsh
primitive	superego	often	consolidates	in	the	first
year	of	life	or	may	even	be	a	primary	identification
(see	PRIMARY	IDENTIFICATION)	that	the	patient
cannot	imagine	being	without.
One	 of	 the	 most	 important	 contributions	 of
Melanie	 Klein	 was	 her	 emphasis	 on	 the	 early
development	 of	 sadistic	 superego	 precursors
before	 the	 oedipal	 period.	 This	 is	 of	 special
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1158
importance	 in	 the	 treatment	 of	 the	 rampant
preoedipal	disorders	that	we	see	in	today’s	clinical
work.	 In	 Kleinian	 theory	 the	 harsh	 sadistic
superego	 precursors	 are	 a	 manifestation	 of	 the
child’s	
own	
infantile	
primordial	
sadistic
phantasies	 and	 strivings,	 turned	 against	 the
individual	 in	 order	 to	 preserve	 the	 maternal
object.
Klein	was	shocked	by	the	amount	of	violence
she	discovered	in	children’s	play	during	her	early
psychoanalytic	play	therapy	explorations.	She	was
also	
influenced	
by	
Abraham	
(1949),	
who
described	 the	 oral	 and	 anal	 sadistic	 phases	 of
development.	 Klein	 soon	 became	 convinced	 that
extreme	cruelty	is	a	basic	instinctual	endowment
of	human	beings.	She	tried	to	link	this	to	Freud’s
death	 instinct	 (see	 DEATH	 INSTINCT)	 without
achieving	general	agreement	on	the	topic.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1159
According	 to	 most	 theories,	 sadism	 and
masochism	 always	 exist	 together.	 In	 classic
psychoanalytic	 theory	 they	 represent	 fusions	 of
the	 libidinal	 and	 the	 aggressive	 drives.	 The	 term
“sadomasochism”	has	been	used	to	emphasize	this
fact.	 Freud	 (1905)	 coined	 the	 term	 “sadism
proper”	 for	 situations	 in	 which	 there	 was	 an
association	 between	 violence	 against	 others	 and
sexual	orgasm;	he	used	“sadism”	more	loosely	to
refer	 to	 hostile	 and	 aggressive	 behavior	 or
fantasies.	There	is	a	certain	ambiguity	in	the	term
in	the	psychoanalytic	literature,	where	“sadism”	is
sometimes	 used	 to	 mean	 violent	 fantasies	 and
behaviors	 accompanied	 by	 sexual	 orgasm	 (a
perversion),	 or	 simply	 violent	 and	 aggressive
fantasies	and	behavior.
Perhaps	the	most	interesting	issue	is	whether
or	not	sadism	is	a	built-in	feature	of	humans.	Some
may	argue	that	one’s	viewpoint	on	this	is	simply	a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1160
projection	 of	 one’s	 own	 pessimistic	 or	 optimistic
orientation	 toward	 life.	 It	 is	 not	 clear	 at	 the
present	writing	how	this	argument	could	ever	be
resolved,	but	certainly	the	history	of	the	twentieth
century,	 culminating	 in	 the	 Holocaust,	 strongly
suggests	aggression	and	destructiveness	as	a	core
feature	of	the	human	psyche,	a	psyche	that	easily
erupts	 when	 the	 thin	 veneer	 of	 civilization	 is
erased	by	various	socioeconomic	conditions	or,	as
in	 the	 situation	 of	 war,	 by	 group	 consent	 (see
CORRUPTION).

SCHIZOID
(LAING)
This	 term	 is	 used	 differently	 by	 different
authors.	The	British	psychoanalysts	tend	to	use	it
in	 place	 of	 what	 United	 States’	 psychoanalysts
would	
call	
“narcissistic.”	
When	
British
psychoanalysts	write	about	schizoid	patients,	they
are	 often	 discussing	 what	 DSM-III-R	 (1987)	 calls
narcissistic	 personality	 disorders.	 Whether	 there
is	 a	 spectrum	 of	 disorders	 ranging	 from	 the
schizoid	 personality	 disorder	 described	 in	 DSM-
III-R,	 through	 borderline	 schizophrenia	 and
schizo-affective	
disorders,	
to	
schizophrenia,
remains	 a	 matter	 of	 dispute	 and	 a	 subject	 of
genetic	research.
In	the	United	States	the	term	“schizoid”	brings
to	mind	the	shy,	sensitive,	aloof,	introverted	type
of	 individual	 who	 is	 easily	 offended	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1162
sometimes	has	persecutory	preoccupations.	When
the	 latter	 become	 predominant,	 the	 condition
shades	 into	 the	 paranoid	 personality	 disorder.
These	
patients	
are	
often	
withdrawn	
and
suspicious,	 and	 tend	 to	 have	 a	 vivid	 fantasy	 life.
This	 fantasy	 life	 may	 enable	 them	 to	 engage	 in
considerable	 creative	 activity	 in	 spite	 of	 their
schizoid	 or	 paranoid	 traits;	 some	 of	 the	 greatest
artists	 in	 history	 have	 clearly	 been	 schizoid	 or
paranoid	personality	disorders.
The	 defenses	 typically	 involved	 are	 splitting,
disavowal,	 introjection	 and	 projection.	 Melanie
Klein	(see	KLEIN)	postulates	a	normal	“paranoid-
schizoid”	 position	 early	 in	 infancy.	 She	 originally
conceived	of	this	as	a	“paranoid	position”	but	was
influenced	by	Fairbairn’s	concept	of	the	“schizoid
position”	 in	 early	 infancy	 which	 results	 in	 the
infant’s	 splitting	 of	 the	 ego	 into	 three	 parts	 (see
QUASI-INDEPENDENCE).	 It	 should	 be	 noted,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1163
however,	that	Klein’s	and	Fairbairn’s	theories	are
not	 compatible	 and	 that	 the	 use	 of	 the	 term
schizoid	 as	 both	 a	 normal	 descriptive	 and
psychopathological	 adjective	 leads	 to	 confusion.
Klein	conceived	of	the	paranoid-schizoid	position
as	 turning	 the	 death	 instinct	 outwards	 and	 thus
preserving	the	infant’s	life;	Fairbairn	argued	that
frustration	during	early	development	led	to	a	split
in	 the	 ego,	 and	 no	 biological	 instincts	 were
involved.	 Bleuler	 (1911)	 introduced	 the	 term
schizoid	personality	to	indicate	what	he	thought	to
be	 the	 typical	 premorbid	 personality	 style	 of
patients	 who	 ultimately	 develop	 schizophrenia.
Today	we	know	that	many	patients	with	schizoid
personality	 disorders	 or	 borderline	 personality
disorders	 never	 go	 on	 to	 develop	 schizophrenia,
and	 a	 substantial	 portion	 of	 patients	 with
schizophrenia	 were	 not	 schizoid	 personality
disorders	before	their	schizophrenia	appeared.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1164
From	 the	 point	 of	 view	 of	 the	 practicing
psychotherapist,	 the	 best	 understanding	 of	 the
schizoid	individual	is	provided	in	the	early	work	of
R.	 D.	 Laing	 (1927-1989).	 According	 to	 Laing
(1969a),	 the	 schizoid	 individual	 is	 split	 in	 two
ways.	With	respect	to	the	world,	he	or	she	is	not	at
home	in	the	world,	but	rather	alienated,	split	off,
and	alone.	The	second	split	is	within	the	patient’s
own	self.	The	true	self	is	split	from	the	false	self;
the	latter	remains	associated	with	the	body.	Such	a
patient	often	speaks	of	his	or	her	body	in	the	third
person,	a	clue	that	this	split	has	taken	place.	For
Laing,	this	is	“tragic	man”	and	represents	a	double
alienation,	as	he	calls	it.
Laing	 borrows	 the	 term	 ontological	insecurity
from	the	theologian	Paul	Tillich,	for	whom	it	was
the	 universal	 human	 condition.	 In	 the	 state	 of
ontological	 insecurity	 there	 is	 no	 sense	 of
continuity	and	no	cohesion	of	the	self	in	time.	For
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1165
Laing,	it	is	the	special	problem	of	the	schizoid.	The
schizoid	 patient	 seeks	 to	 preserve	 the	 self,	 as
compared	 to	 neurotics	 and	 normal	 individuals,
who	 wish	 to	 gratify	 the	 self	 (see	 ONTOLOGICAL
INSECURITY).
The	cause	of	ontological	insecurity	is	the	lack
of	 mirroring	 of	 the	 true	 self,	 according	 to	 Laing,
the	absence	of	the	smiling	notice	and	appreciation
of	the	patient’s	self	as	a	child.	He	(1969a)	writes
that	the	development	of	a	self	requires	“the	loving
eye	 of	 the	 mother”	 (p.	 125).	 This	 is	 required	 for
ontological	
autonomy,	
Laing	
says.	
Patients
exhibiting	such	insecurity,	however,	do	not	suffer
from	 unconscious	 conflicts.	 Their	 problem	 is
“beyond	the	pleasure	principle.”	Laing	gives	a	case
example	of	agoraphobia	based	on	the	well-known
unconscious	fantasy	of	being	a	prostitute.	But	the
patient’s	 sexual	 fantasy	 used	 sex	 as	 a	 way	 of
recognition,	to	create	the	illusion	of	being	looked
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1166
at	 and	 desired.	 It	 was	 not	 based	 primarily	 on	 a
defense	against	incestuous	desires.	Gratification	is
not	 the	 issue	 for	 patients	 with	 ontological
insecurity,	 says	 Laing.	 This	 resembles	 Kohut’s
(1984)	 version	 of	 self	 psychology,	 although	 the
terminology	is	quite	different.
The	schizoid	patient	oscillates	between	merger
and	 isolation	 and	 psychologically	 splits	 into	 a
secret	true	self	and	a	body	associated	with	a	false
self	(see	FALSE	SELF).	All	of	us	reversibly	do	this
under	stress,	for	example,	at	a	boring	party,	under
torture,	during	a	painful	or	embarrassing	medical
examination,	or	during	painful	dental	work;	but	in
the	 schizoid	 individual,	 a	 definitive	 split	 occurs
between	 the	 true	 self	 and	 a	 false	 self	 system,	 in
which	the	false	self	system	becomes	the	manifest
personality.
This	 definitive	 split	 engenders	 the	 schizoid
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1167
style.	 The	 patient,	 in	 a	 common	 clinical	 picture,
tries	 to	 do	 everything	 for	 himself	 or	 herself	 in
isolation.	
This	
protects	
the	
patient	
from
ontological	insecurity	and	the	anxieties	associated
with	 ontological	 insecurity	 (see	 ONTOLOGICAL
INSECURITY),	 but	 it	 is	 impossible	 since	 we	 all
need	other	people;	isolation	of	one’s	self	leads	to
despair	 and	 a	 sense	 of	 emptiness	 and	 alienation
from	the	world.	The	common	schizoid	existential
complaint	 of	 the	 futility	 and	 meaninglessness	 of
life	arises	from	this.	The	patient	longs	to	get	into
life,	and	suffers	a	dread	of	the	increased	emptiness
and	dissolution	that	develops	as	the	patient	feels
more	and	more	isolated	and	vulnerable.	This	is	a
problem,	 says	 Laing,	 which	 begins	 in	 infancy.	 He
(1969a)	writes,	“The	more	the	self	is	defended	this
way,	the	more	it	is	cut	off	and	destroyed”	(pp.	80-
81).	There	is	no	exit	for	this	mode	of	being-in-the-
world,	 similar	 to	 Sartre’s	 (1949)	 concept	 of	 “no
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1168
exit,”	hell	as	an	eternal	trap	with	no	way	out.
The	true	self	is	never	revealed	by	the	schizoid
individual.	 It	 is	 hidden	 by	 compliance,	 which,	 as
Kohut	 (1984)	 pointed	 out,	 is	 the	 hardest
resistance	of	all	to	deal	with	in	any	treatment.	In
the	famous	terms	of	Martin	Buber	(1958),	there	is
for	 the	 healthy	 person	 an	 I-Thou	 or	 creative
relationship,	 in	 which	 the	 mutual	 potentiation	 of
ourselves	 with	 the	 world	 around	 us	 and	 others
take	place.	Laing	compares	this	with	the	Quasi-it
(compliant	
false	
self)—It	
(petrified	
or
depersonalized	 other)	 relationship,	 a	 sterile
relationship	 in	 which	 both	 the	 person	 and
surrounding	 individuals	 are	 impoverished.	 As
Laing	(1967)	writes,	if	you	don’t	live	in	the	world
with	people,	“something	dies	inside”	(p.	144).
In	these	patients	the	inner	true	self	breaks	up
into	 subsystems	 or	 fragments.	 It	 hates	 itself	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1169
becomes	
preoccupied	
with	
fantasies	
and
memories	 that	 get	 more	 and	 more	 unrealistic,
since	the	individual	is	not	in	contact	with	others
and	the	world	for	correction.	Clinically	the	patient
complains	of	a	world	in	ruins	and	the	self	as	dead,
impoverished,	 and	 empty.	 There	 is	 no	 frantic
activity	that	can	bring	it	to	life	again,	although	the
patient	may	try	everything.
Such	a	person	never	really	marries.	He	or	she
is	perpetually	alone,	and	never	commits	himself	or
herself	fully	to	anything	in	the	world,	as	this	would
reveal	 the	 true	 self.	 The	 patient	 is	 filled	 with
longing,	envy,	and	hatred	of	the	self	and	the	world,
and	 is	 guilty	 over	 duplicity,	 fearing	 at	 the	 same
time	
his	
or	
her	
own	
destructiveness	
or
fragmentation,	which	Laing	calls	“going	crazy.”
The	 typical	 clinical	 problem	 of	 the	 schizoid
patient	 is	 a	 morbid	 self-consciousness.	 This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1170
assures	 the	 patient	 that	 he	 or	 she	 exists.	 The
patient	is	apprehensive	and	hypervigilant,	sensing
a	danger	that	is	felt	everywhere	as	a	consequence
of	the	patient’s	ontological	insecurity.	This	poses	a
dilemma,	since	the	patient	wishes	to	be	seen	and
to	have	his	or	her	self	confirmed	but	at	the	same
time	wishes	to	be	invisible,	since	it	is	a	threat	to
the	self	if	the	patient	is	seen.
Persecutory	 delusions	 or	 ideas	 of	 reference
represent	 an	 attempt	 to	 mirror	 one’s	 self.	 They
represent	some	form	of	imagined	responding,	says
Laing.	 The	 cold	 gaze	 of	 the	 mother	 now	 comes
inside	 and	 is	 projected	 in	 an	 attempt	 at	 self-
mirroring.	 Laing	 (1969a)	 presents	 the	 dramatic
case	 of	 Peter,	 who	 was	 always	 treated	 by	 his
family	literally	as	not	being	there.	This	patient	was
overwhelmed	with	chronic	anxiety	and	ontological
insecurity,	typical	of	the	schizoid	tragedy.

SCHIZOPHRENIA
(see	also	SCHIZOID)
This	term	was	introduced	by	Bleuler	(1911)	to
describe	the	group	of	psychoses	separated	out	by
Kraepelin	as	dementia	praecox	and	differentiated
from	 manic-depressive	 disorders.	 The	 earliest
distinction	among	the	schizophrenias	was	of	three
varieties:	 the	 hebephrenic,	 the	 catatonic,	 and	 the
paranoid.	 DSM-III-R	 (1987)	 uses	 a	 somewhat
amended	classification.	(The	reader	is	referred	to
the	 APA	 manual	 for	 an	 overall	 description	 of
schizophrenia.)
The	truth	is	there	is	very	little	consensus	on	or
understanding	of	this	condition.	Bleuler	thought	of
it	 as	 representing	 a	 splitting	 of	 the	 mind	 that
resulted	
in	
four	
fundamental	
symptoms:
inappropriate	 affect,	 ambivalence,	 autism,	 and,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1173
above	
all,	
a	
disturbance	
in	
the	
normal
associational	 processes	 of	 thought.	 A	
vast
literature	 has	 developed	 on	 the	 subject	 of
schizophrenia	 and	 numerous	 theories	 abound.
There	 seems	 to	 be	 general	 agreement	 that	 some
sort	of	genetic	predisposition	to	the	disorder	must
exist	for	it	to	appear.	Depending	on	the	strength	of
this	 disposition,	 there	 will	 also	 be	 certain
unfavorable	environmental	factors	in	the	etiology
that	 precipitate	 the	 disorder.	 Earlier	 in	 this
century	much	focus	had	been	placed	on	the	role	of
the	 so-called	 schizophrenogenic	 mother	 and	 the
passive,	relatively	impotent	father.	This	resulted	in
an	 unfortunate	 phase	 of	 “mother-bashing”	 in	 the
literature.	Today	the	emphasis	is	more	on	genetic
factors,	 but	 the	 problem	 is	 that	 there	 is	 no
consensus	on	what	constitutes	the	essence	of	the
group	of	schizophrenias,	which	makes	all	forms	of
research	extremely	difficult.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1174
This	problem	was	recognized	by	Freud	(1911),
who	
was	
not	
impressed	
with	
the	
term
“schizophrenia”	because	he	felt	that	it	prejudiced
the	 issue	 by	 making	 the	 splitting	 a	 central
characteristic.	
Instead	
he	
used	
the	
term
“paraphrenia”	 (see	 PARAPHRENIA),	 but	 this	 did
not	receive	general	acceptance.
Freud	 (1914)	 thought	 of	 schizophrenia	 as
involving	 three	 groups	 of	 phenomena:	 (a)	 those
representing	 what	 remains	 of	 the	 normal	 or
neurotic	 state	 of	 the	 individual;	 (b)	 those
representing	detachment	of	libido	from	its	objects,
leading	 to	 megalomania,	 hypochondriasis,	 and
regression;	and	(c)	restitutive	symptoms	in	which
an	effort	is	made	to	attach	the	libido	to	objects	or
at	 least	 to	 their	 verbal	 representations.	 These
distinctions	form	the	foundation	of	Freud’s	theory
of	schizophrenia.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1175
Freud	 (1915)	 postulated	 that	 schizophrenics
have	given	up	the	cathexis	of	objects	with	libido;
they	 return	 this	 libido	 on	 the	 soma	 in	 the
formation	 of	 hypochondriasis,	 and	 on	 the	 self	 in
the	 formation	 of	 megalomania.	 In	 schizophrenia
words	 are	 subjected	 to	 the	 same	 process	 as	 that
which	 makes	 dream	 images	 out	 of	 latent	 dream
thoughts.	Thus	words	undergo	condensation	and
displacement	and	indeed,	a	single	word	may	take
over	 the	 representation	 of	 a	 whole	 train	 of
thought.	However,	there	is	an	essential	difference
between	 dream	 work	 and	 schizophrenia:	 in
schizophrenia	the	words	themselves,	in	which	the
preconscious	 thought	 was	 expressed,	 become
subject	 to	 modification;	 in	 dreams,	 it	 is	 not	 the
preconscious	thoughts	or	words	that	are	modified,
but	what	Freud	calls	the	“thing	presentations”	in
the	 unconscious.	 In	 schizophrenia	 the	 link
between	 word	 presentations	 in	 the	 preconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1176
and	 thing	 presentations	 in	 the	 unconscious	 is
broken,	so	that	the	schizophrenic	is	forced	to	be
content	 with	 words	 instead	 of	 external	 things
because	of	withdrawal	of	libido	from	the	outside
world.	The	hypercathexis	of	word	presentations	is
an	 effort	 to	 regain	 the	 lost	 thing	 presentations
from	 both	 the	 external	 and	 internal	 world.	 The
schizophrenic	confuses	these	two	worlds	and	ends
up	embedded	in	the	word	presentations	of	each.
At	 this	 point	 it	 is	 best	 to	 think	 of	 the
schizophrenias	 as	 a	 heterogenous	 group	 of
disorders	 that	 no	 single	 theory	 can	 explain.	 The
loss	of	reality	testing	is,	of	course,	the	most	serious
aspect	 of	 schizophrenia	 and	 invariably	 causes
grave	 problems.	 Hallucinations,	 delusions,	 and
regression	to	very	primitive	levels	of	intrapsychic
and	interpersonal	functioning	are	characteristic	of
schizophrenia,	especially	in	the	acute	phases.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1177
Today	
psychopharmacologic	
agents	
are
commonly	 used	 to	 treat	 schizophrenia.	 This
treatment	can	make	the	patient	more	amenable	to
hospital	 management	 or	 even	 home	 care,	 but	 it
has	 the	 disadvantage	 of	 quieting	 the	 patient’s
communications	 and	 making	 it	 harder	 for	 the
therapist	to	learn	from	the	patient	about	his	or	her
difficulties.	 In	 addition,	 there	 are	 problems
associated	
with	
overmedication,	
including
neuroleptic	 malignancy	 syndrome	 and	 tardive
dyskinesia.	 Some	 side	 effects	 are	 not	 reversible
even	after	the	medication	has	been	stopped.	The
advantages	 of	 psychopharmacologic	 treatment,
however,	outweigh	the	disadvantages.
Psychosis	develops	from	the	situation	of	a	false
self	 system,	 according	 to	 Laing	 (1969;	 see
SCHIZOID).	 The	 schizoid	 solution	 fails,	 anxiety
increases,	 and	 more	 desperate	 measures	 are
needed.	The	inner	world	becomes	more	and	more
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1178
unreal;	deadness	and	hate	increase.	The	false	self
system	 expands	 and	 becomes	 autonomous,	 and
the	individual	begins	to	feel	that	he	or	she	has	a
mechanical	 body	 that	 belongs	 to	 others.	 The
patient	tries	to	use	magic,	to	touch,	to	feel,	or	even
to	 steal,	 somehow	 to	 fill	 the	 emptiness;	 this
dynamic	 is	 found	 in	 many	 cases	 of	 bulimia.	 The
schizophrenic’s	last	hope	may	be	in	such	extreme
activities	 as	 child	 molestation,	 promiscuity,
homosexuality,	 or	 perversions.	 Again,	 this	 is
similar	
to	
Kohut’s	
(1977)	
description	
of
fragmentation	of	the	self.
The	
true	
self	
may	
suddenly	
emerge,
manifesting	 all	 its	 unrealistic	 fantasies,	 and	 we
discover,	 says	 Laing,	 that	 our	 carefully	 recorded
“psychiatric	 history”	 has	 been	 the	 history	 of	 the
false	 self	 system.	 The	 “cure”	 here,	 using	 drugs,
milieu	therapy,	and	so	forth,	would	be	to	get	the
patient	back	to	manifesting	the	false	self	system.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1179
The	patient	either	decides	to	go	back	to	the	false
self	system	or	murders	the	self	in	such	activities	as
self-mutilation,	 suicide,	 or	 homicide	 (killing	 the
projected	 “bad”	 part	 of	 the	 self).	 This	 preserves
any	 sense	 of	 being	 alive	 and	 reduces	 anxiety
because	 the	 patient	 says,	 paradoxically,	 “If	 I	 am
dead	I	cannot	be	killed.”	In	chronic	schizophrenia
the	 self	 breaks	 up	 into	 fragments	 or	 archetypal
agencies,	to	use	Laing’s	term.	The	final	result	is	the
disintegrated	dilapidated	hebephrenic.
In	treatment	we	must	always	remember	that	a
true	self	exists	somewhere	in	every	patient.	We	try
to	 contact	 this.	 When	 we	 do,	 the	 patient	 feels
understood	 and	 schizophrenia	 abates.	 Thus,	 for
Laing,	 schizophrenia	 is	 a	 smoke	 screen	 for
protection	 and	 the	 physician	 must	 fight	 to	 get
through	 it	 to	 the	 true	 self.	 Diagnosis	 is	 based	 on
the	“praecox	feeling”;	that	is,	the	physician	is	in	the
presence	of	another	person,	yet	feels	that	nobody
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1180
is	there.	It	is	a	life-in-death	existence.
One	of	the	great	pioneers	in	the	understanding
and	psychotherapy	of	schizophrenic	patients	was
Harry	Stack	Sullivan	(1892-1949),	who	developed
a	 psychological	 explanation	 for	 schizophrenic
disorders	 and	 demonstrated	 that	 schizophrenic
processes	 were	 never	 very	 far	 from	 the	 normal
processes	 of	 living.	 In	 contrast	 to	 prevailing
theories,	 Sullivan	 (1947,	 1953,	 1956,	 1962)
showed	 that	 schizophrenia	 can	 develop	 as	 the
direct	outgrowth	of	psychological	issues	and	that
it	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
individual.	
He	
saw
schizophrenia	as	a	personality	distortion	emerging
from	 a	 complicated	 and	 warped	 series	 of
interpersonal	relations,	and	he	documented	this	in
innumerable	 case	 histories	 and	 studies.	 (See
Chessick	 1991	 for	 a	 brief	 review	 of	 Sullivan’s
psychodynamic	theories.)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1181
By	demonstrating	the	roots	of	schizophrenia	in
the	 distortions	 of	 personality	 development,
Sullivan	greatly	stimulated	the	hope	of	a	possible
psychotherapeutic	resolution	of	this	disorder.	He
felt	that	the	most	peculiar	behavior	of	the	acutely
schizophrenic	
patient	
was	
made	
up	
of
interpersonal	processes	that	were	in	essence	the
same	as	those	found	in	every	person.	He	felt	that
the	core	of	the	schizophrenic	state	was	a	failure	of
the	self-system	and	that	the	schizophrenic	change
was	 due	 to	 an	 inability	 to	 maintain	 dissociation.
The	 best	 detailed	 explanation	 of	 this	 is	 in
Sullivan’s	 Clinical	 Studies	 in	 Psychiatry	 (1956),
which	 consists	 of	 material	 contained	 in	 lectures
given	in	1943.
A	typical	concept	of	Sullivan	is	the	notion	of	the
malevolent	 transformation.	 As	 Sullivan	 (1953)
conceives	of	it,	this	occurs	as	a	miscarriage	of	the
need	 for	 tenderness,	 in	 which	 a	 child	 discovers
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1182
that	 manifesting	 the	 need	 for	 tenderness	 toward
figures	around	him	or	her	leads	to	anxiety	rather
than	 to	 relief.	 The	 child	 learns	 that	 it	 is	 highly
disadvantageous	 to	 show	 any	 need	 for	 tender
cooperation	 from	 authority,	 in	 which	 case	 he	 or
she	shows	a	basic	malevolent	attitude,	the	attitude
that	one	really	lives	among	enemies.	This	causes	a
situation	 in	 which	 the	 child	 makes	 it	 practically
impossible	for	anyone	to	feel	tenderly	toward	him
or	her.	The	patient	outwits	the	caretakers	by	the
display	 of	 his	 or	 her	 attitude,	 which	 is	 a
manifestation	of	the	early	discovery	that	any	need
for	 tenderness	 would	 bring	 anxiety	 or	 pain.	 This
serious	 distortion	 of	 what	 might	 be	 called	 the
fundamental	
interpersonal	
attitude	
Sullivan
(1953)	defines	as	the	malevolent	transformation:
“Once	upon	a	time	everything	was	lovely,	but	that
was	before	I	had	to	deal	with	people”	(p.	216).
Sullivan	(1947)	did	not	regard	the	capacity	for
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1183
interpersonal	 relations	 as	 completed	 during	 any
point	 of	 development,	 which	 was	 another
important	 disagreement	 that	 he	 had	 with	 basic
Freudian	
concepts.	
Sullivan’s	
view	
of
schizophrenia	is	not	generally	shared,	and	only	a
mere	 handful	 of	 schizophrenic	 people	 receive
psychotherapy	today.	The	main	reason	for	this	is
not	 so	 much	 the	 theoretical	 argument	 about	 the
meaning	of	schizophrenia	as	the	lack	of	motivation
or	 financial	 resources	 to	 maintain	 long-term
intensive	
psychotherapy	
of	
any	
patients,
particularly	schizophrenics.
The	best	application	of	Sullivan’s	work	to	the
treatment	of	schizophrenia	is	found	in	the	writing
of	 Fromm-Reichmann	 (1950,	 1959)	 and	 Pao
(1979).	These	authors	should	be	studied	carefully
and	 their	 knowledge	 and	 suggestions	 thoroughly
mastered	 before	 any	 attempt	 is	 made	 to	 do
intensive	 psychotherapy	 with	 a	 schizophrenic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1184
patient.	 Schizophrenic	 patients	 are	 notorious	 for
raising	 the	 anxiety	 level	 of	 therapists,	 and
therefore	 a	 very	 thorough	 and	 in-depth	 personal
psychoanalysis	
is	
required	
for	
any
psychotherapist	who	attempts	to	work	with	them.

SCREEN	MEMORIES
A	screen	memory	is	defined	by	Freud	(1899)
as	a	recollection	whose	value	lies	in	the	fact	that	it
represents,	
in	
the	
reported	
memory	
of
impressions	 of	 a	 later	 date,	 events	 that	 are
associated	either	by	symbolic	or	other	links	from
an	 earlier	 date	 in	 a	 person’s	 life.	 Freud
distinguished	between	the	simpler	type	of	screen
memory,	in	which	the	preserved	memory	is	but	a
part	 of	 a	 more	 significant	 whole	 that	 has	 been
repressed,	and	a	more	complex	type,	in	which	the
memory	is	a	construction	combining	the	memory
of	 a	 certain	 event	 in	 early	 childhood	 with	 a
repressed	memory	of	an	event	in	adolescence.	The
earlier	memory	is	not	necessarily	untrue	but	is	a
harmless	 substitute	 for	 the	 later,	 unacceptable
memory.	 The	 autobiographical	 screen	 memory
described	by	Freud	is	of	this	complex	type,	one	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1187
which	an	early	memory	is	used	as	a	screen	for	the
memory	 of	 later	 events.	 This	 kind	 of	 screen
memory	is	not	mentioned	as	often	in	subsequent
literature.
Freud	 (1901)	 points	 out	 that	 in	 earliest
childhood	 recollections	 we	 possess	 not	 the
genuine	 memory	 but	 a	 later	 revision	 of	 it.	 This
revision	is	subjected	to	influences	of	a	variety	of
later	psychic	forces;	thus	memories	presented	by
patients	as	from	early	childhood	acquire	the	same
significance	 as	 screen	 memories.	 This	 explains
why	 a	 person’s	 earliest	 childhood	 memories
frequently	 seem	 to	 have	 preserved	 what	 is
indifferent	and	unimportant,	and	why	some	seem
even	odd	and	unintelligible.	The	usual	processes	of
condensation	 and	 displacement	 with	 respect	 to
both	time	and	place	are	at	work	here	just	as	in	the
formation	of	dreams:	“The	indifferent	memories	of
childhood	 owe	 their	 existence	 to	 a	 process	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1188
displacement:	 they	 are	 substitutes,	 in	 (mnemic)
reproduction,	 for	 other	 impressions	 which	 are
really	significant”	(p.	43).
The	indifferent	memories	of	childhood	that	are
reported	owe	their	preservation	to	an	associative
relation	 between	 their	 content	 and	 another
memory	that	is	repressed—	in	this	sense,	they	are
screen	
memories.	
Similarly,	
mistakes	
in
recollection	 cannot	 be	 attributed	 to	 simply	 a
treacherous	memory,	for	motives	are	present	that
make	 the	 distortion	 and	 the	 displacement	 of	 the
experience	 necessary:	 “Strong	 forces	 from	 later
life	have	been	at	work	on	the	capacity	of	childhood
experiences	for	being	remembered—probably	the
same	forces	which	are	responsible	for	our	having
become	
so	
far	
removed	
in	
general	
from
understanding	our	years	of	childhood”	(p.	47).
Freud’s	 screen	 memory	 work	 implies	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1189
importance	 of	 asking	 patients	 for	 their	 earliest
memories,	the	content	of	which	is	usually	referred
back	to	the	period	between	ages	2	and	4.	The	most
frequent	content	of	the	earliest	memories	involves
occasions	 of	 fear,	 shame,	 physical	 pain,	 and	 such
important	events	as	illnesses,	deaths,	fires,	and	the
births	 of	 siblings.	 Such	 memories	 must	 be
regarded	 as	 disguised	 representations	 of	 more
fundamental	
psychological	
interactions	
with
significant	 people	 in	 the	 past,	 or	 even	 better,	 as
representations	 of	 the	 atmosphere	 of	 early
childhood.	 As	 such,	 they	 are	 important	 clues	 to
what	 will	 appear	 in	 the	 transference	 and	 in	 the
uncovering	 of	 significant	 childhood	 interactions
and	events.	It	should	be	added	that	such	“events”
may	 never	 have	 happened	 at	 all	 and	 the	 screen

SELF,
SENSE	OF	SELF
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1191
(see	also	BIPOLAR	SELF)
Self	is	one	of	the	most	difficult	terms	to	define
because	 it	 is	 used	 in	 so	 many	 ways	 by	 so	 many
authors.	Even	Samuel	Johnson	(1773)	devotes	two
pages	 of	 quotations	 to	 trying	 to	 get	 the	 notion
clear,	after	stating	that	the	primary	signification	of
the	 term	 “seems	 to	 be	 that	 of	 an	 adjective;	 very;
particular;	 this	 above	 others;	 sometimes,	 one’s
own”	 (p.	 1737).	 No	 two	 authors	 use	 this	 term
exactly	 the	 same	 way.	 A	 thorough	 review	 of	 the
concept	 of	 self	 in	 psychoanalytic	 theory	 and	 its
philosophical	
foundations	
is	
presented	
by
Kirshner	 (1991),	 and	 a	 study	 of	 this	 review
indicates	the	complexity	and	conceptual	problems
involved.
Perhaps	the	best-known	use	of	the	term	“self’
is	that	of	Mead	(1962),	a	pragmatist	who	tried	to
eliminate	 the	 parallelism	 between	 the	 mind	 and
the	body	by	seeing	the	mind	and	the	self	as	arising
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1192
out	 of	 social	 interaction	 and	 having	 no	 innate
separate	existence.	For	Mead,	the	self	was	a	social
self	 that	 formed	 in	 two	 stages.	 At	 first,	 the
individual’s	 self	 is	 constituted	 simply	 by	 an
organization	of	the	attitudes	of	others	toward	both
the	 individual	 and	 one	 another	 in	 the	 specific
social	 acts	 in	 which	 the	 individual	 participates
with	 them.	 Then,	 at	 the	 second	 stage,	 there	 is
added	 “an	 organization	 of	 the	 social	 attitudes	 of
the	 generalized	 other	 or	 the	 social	 group	 as	 a
whole	to	which	he	belongs”	(p.	158).	For	Mead,	the
mind	 or	 self	 is	 formed	 by	 “reflexiveness”	 from
social	experience,	a	view	that	influenced	Sullivan
(1953)	 in	 forming	 his	 interpersonal	 school	 of
psychiatry	 and	 a	 view	 that	 represents	 “social
behaviorism,”	an	attempt	to	extend	empiricism	to
the	psychology	of	the	mind	or	the	self
Thus	 most	 authors	 used	 the	 term	 “self’	 as	 a
social	construction	until	it	came	to	be	employed	by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1193
psychoanalysts.	Freud	did	not	distinguish	between
the	 self	 and	 the	 ego.	 In	 current	 object	 relations
theory	(see	OBJECT	RELATIONS	THEORY),	such	as
that	of	Kernberg,	the	term	“self’	really	means	“self-
representations.”
Kohut	 (1977)	 maintained	 that	 the	 self	 in	 its
essence	 cannot	 be	 defined,	 and	 concentrates	 his
work	on	the	“sense	of	self.”	There	is	no	agreement,
even	 among	 self	 psychologists,	 on	 a	 strict
definition	of	“self.”	Kohut	(1978)	claimed	that	the
fundamental	 advance	 of	 psychoanalytic	 fact-
finding	 is	 to	 step	 into	 a	 new	 methodology	 by
which	 the	 therapist	 vicariously	 introspects	 with
the	patient	and	experiences	the	inner	self	and	the
world	around	the	patient	in	a	manner	congruent
to	 that	 of	 the	 patient.	 This	 yields	 important	 data
about	 the	 state	 of	 the	 patient	 that	 cannot	 be
obtained	 in	 any	 other	 manner	 of	 approach	 (see
SELF	PSYCHOLOGY).	Kohut’s	(1971)	early	notion
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1194
of	 the	 sense	 of	 self	 comes	 from	 the	 therapist’s
empathic	identification	with	the	patient’s	sense	of
self	at	any	given	time.	It	is	in	truly	understanding
how	the	patient’s	sense	of	self	waxes	and	wanes,
or	 coheres	 and	 fragments,	 that	 we	 gain	 an
explanation	of	why	and	how	the	patient	perceives
the	inner	and	outer	world	around	him	or	her	and
behaves	accordingly.
This	 is	 more	 experience-near	 than	 Freud’s
metapsychology,	 because	 additional	 apparatuses
or	 structures	 are	 not	 postulated	 as	 homunculi
within	the	head	of	the	individual	determining	the
outcome	of	his	behavior;	the	patient’s	perception
and	 behavior	 are	 directly	 attributable	 to	 the
patient’s	 sense	 of	 self.	 This	 approach	 sidesteps
what	 Freud	 (1937,	 p.	 225)	 called	 the	 witch
metapsychology,	but	understanding	then	depends
fundamentally	on	the	capacity	of	the	therapist	to
empathize	 with	 the	 patient’s	 inner	 state	 at	 any
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1195
given	time.
The	parallel	between	Kant’s	(1781)	noumenal
self,	 which	 lies	 behind	 our	 synthetic	 unity	 of
consciousness	in	our	inner	states	as	phenomenally
perceived,	 and	 Kohut’s	 self,	 which	 lies	 behind
empathically	
perceived	
psychological
manifestations,	steadily	expands	as	Kohut	matures
in	 his	 views.	 Kohut	 (1977)	 writes	 in	 The
Restoration	of	the	Self:
We	 can	 collect	 data	 concerning	 the	 way	 in
which	
the	
set	
of	
introspectively	
or
empathically	perceived	inner	experiences	to
which	 we	 later	 refer	 as	 “I”	 is	 gradually
established,	 and	 we	 can	 observe	 certain
characteristic	vicissitudes	of	this	experience.
We	 can	 describe	 various	 cohesive	 forms	 in
which	the	self	appears,	can	demonstrate	the
several	constituents	that	make	up	the	self—
its	two	poles	(ambitions	and	ideals)	and	the
area	 of	 talents	 and	 skills	 that	 is	 interposed
between	 the	 two	 poles—and	 explain	 their
genesis	 and	 functions.	 And	 we	 can,	 finally,
distinguish	 between	 various	 self	 types	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1196
can	 explain	 their	 distinguishing	 features	 on
the	basis	of	the	predominance	of	one	or	the
other	 of	 their	 constituents.	 We	 can	 do	 all
that,	but	we	will	still	not	know	the	essence	of
the	
self	
as	
differentiated	
from	
its
manifestations.	[p.	311]
Here	 the	 self	 is	 “a	 generalization	 derived	 from
empirical	data,”	and	like	Kant’s	noumenal	self,	has
both	 a	 stimulating	 and	 a	 synthesizing	 set	 of
functions.	The	kind	of	empirical	data	from	which	it
is	 derived,	 the	 data	 of	 vicarious	 introspection,
differs	 from	 the	 empirical	 data	 used	 by	 Kant
(introspected	inner	states	that	Kant	says	lead	up
to	the	limiting	concept	of	the	noumenal	self),	but
the	concept	of	the	underlying	and	unknowable	self
is	the	same.
Later,	Kohut	at	times,	like	Kant,	slips	into	the
concept	 of	 self	 in	 the	 positive	 sense,	 as	 when	 he
speaks	 of	 it	 as	 empty	 and	 depleted,	 or	 as
“yearning”	 for	 mirroring	 or	 merger.	 The	 self	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1197
these	situations	is	used	as	an	“as-if’	concept,	and
the	anthropomorphic	language	has	been	criticized.
For	 example,	 in	 a	 footnote	 to	 Kohut	 and	 Wolf
(1978)	
the	
criticism	
of	
the	
psychoanalyst
Nathaniel	 London	 is	 mentioned:	 “He	 thinks	 our
language	often	suggests	an	anthropomorphization
of	 the	 concept	 ‘self’,	 in	 the	 same	 way	 that	 ‘ego’
used	 to	 be	 anthropomorphized”	 (p.	 415n);	 in
essence,	 Kohut	 and	 Wolf	 plead	 guilty	 to	 the
accusation	 but	 claim	 that	 it	 is	 “in	 the	 service	 of
evocativeness	and	conciseness”	(p.	416n).
Kohut	 (1971,	 p.	 130)	 mentions	 that	 the
cohesive	experience	of	the	self	in	time	is	the	same
as	the	experience	of	the	self	as	a	continuum,	which
seems	 to	 be	 the	 same	 as	 Kant’s	 notion	 of	 inner
states;	in	the	same	paragraph	Kohut	mentions	the
“breadth	 and	 depth”	 of	 cohesiveness	 of	 the	 self,
but	without	definition.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1198
Kohut’s	(1971)	concept	of	the	fragmentation	of
the	 self	 (see	 FRAGMENTATION)	 is	 equated	 with
psychoticlike	 phenomena,	 at	 which	 time	 reality
testing	 and	 contact	 even	 with	 the	 therapist	 is	 in
danger	 of	 being	 lost.	 It	 is	 characterized	 as	 a
regressive	
phenomenon,	
predominantly
autoerotic,	in	contrast	to	the	state	of	the	cohesive
self,	 “the	 growth	 of	 the	 self	 experience	 as	 a
physical	and	mental	unit	which	has	cohesiveness
in	space	and	continuity	in	time”	(p.	118).
Kohut’s	
(1971)	
original	
notion	
of	
the
cohesiveness	 of	 the	 self	 has	 to	 do	 with	 a	 “firm
cathexis	with	narcissistic	libido”	(p.	119),	leading
to	 a	 subjective	 feeling	 of	 well-being	 and	 an
improvement	of	the	functioning	of	the	ego.	In	later
writings	 this	 metapsychological	 explanation	 is
dropped;	 signs	 of	 fragmentation	 of	 the	 self	 then
have	 to	 do	 with	 a	 subjective	 feeling	 of	 self-state
anxiety,	 and	 of	 objective	 and	 subjective	 signs	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1199
deteriorating	ego	function.	Thus	fragmentation	of
the	self,	which	Kohut	calls	“the	dissolution	of	the
narcissistic	 unity	 of	 the	 self’	 (pp.	 120-121),	 is
manifested	 by	 certain	 characteristic	 subjective
sensations,	 such	 as	 hypochondria	 and	 frantic
activities,	“in	order	to	stem	the	tide	of	regression.”
Kohut	sees	a	regression	from	the	cohesiveness	of
the	 self	 to	 its	 fragmentation	 as	 parallel	 to	 a
regression	 from	 narcissism	 to	 autoerotism.	 A
clinical	description	of	this	is	based	on	the	self	as	an
organizing	center	of	the	ego’s	activities.	When	the
self	 fragments,	 the	 personality	 that	 has	 not
participated	 in	 the	 regression	 attempts	 to	 deal
with	
the	
central	
fragmentation,	
but	
“the
experience	of	the	fragmented	body-mind-self	and
self-object	 cannot	 be	 psychologically	 elaborated”
(p.	30).
In	 The	 Restoration	 of	 the	 Self	 (1977),	 Kohut
conceives	 of	 the	 self	 as	 a	 supraordinate	 concept
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1200
and	elaborates	on	its	bipolar	nature	(see	BIPOLAR
SELF).	 In	 this	 work	 metapsychological	 energic
concepts	are	dropped	out,	and	the	self	is	now	seen
as	 occupying	 the	 central	 position	 within	 the
personality.	 Kohut	 also	 writes	 about	 a	 core	 self
present	early	in	life:	“This	structure	is	the	basis	for
our	 sense	 of	 being	 an	 independent	 center	 of
initiative	and	perception,	integrated	with	our	most
central	 ambitions	 and	 ideals	 and	 with	 our
experience	that	our	body	and	mind	form	a	unit	in
space	and	a	continuum	in	time”	(p.	177).
Kohut,	 then,	 first	 presents	 the	 self	 as	 an
experience-near	 abstraction	 from	 psychoanalytic
experience.	As	his	work	evolves,	he	focuses	more
and	more	on	the	self,	finally	placing	the	self	“into
the	 center	 of	 our	 being	 from	 which	 all	 initiative
springs	 and	 where	 all	 experiences	 end”	 (Kohut
1978,	p.	95).	This	emphasis	on	the	self	would	be
the	same	as	Kant’s	noumenal	self	used	to	explain
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1201
free	will—	again,	a	center	of	our	being	from	which
all	 initiative	 springs	 and	 where	 all	 experiences
end.	When	Kohut	moves	to	the	bipolar	self	and	its
constituents	he	introduces	a	new	concept.	The	self
is	 no	 longer	 a	 depth-psychological	 concept	 that
can	be	metapsychologically	defined	using	classical
terminology,	and	the	self	is	no	longer	thought	of	as
either	 within	 the	 mental	 apparatus	 or	 even	 as	 a
fourth	“agency”	of	the	mind.	“The	area	of	the	self
and	its	vicissitudes,”	as	Kohut	(1978,	p.	753)	calls
it,	 is	 essentially	 a	 separate	 science	 from	 Freud’s
psychoanalysis,	
just	
as	
the	
study	
of	
the
phenomenal	world	in	the	Critique	of	Pure	Reason	is
a	 separate	 discipline	 from	 the	 study	 of	 the
noumenal	world	in	the	Critique	of	Practical	Reason
(Chessick	1980).
Kohut	 (1978)	 himself	 labels	 his	 work	 “the
science	of	the	self’	(p.	752n),	and	the	conclusion	is
inevitable	 that	 he	 has	 attempted	 to	 found	 a	 new
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1202
science.	 Kohut,	 like	 Kant,	 although	 he	 claims	 to
maintain	an	experience-near	definition	of	the	self,
relies	more	and	more	on	the	definition	of	the	self
as	a	supraordinate	concept,	which	more	resembles
Kant’s	 noumenal	 self	 as	 an	 explanatory	 concept.
We	see	the	evolution	of	this	in	Kohut,	beginning,
for	example,	in	his	1972	presentation	(chapter	31
in	 The	 Search	 for	 the	 Self	 [1978]),	 in	 which	 he
definitely	offers	the	earlier	definition,	and	moving
toward	his	focus	on	the	self	in	The	Restoration	of
the	 Self	 (1977)	 as	 a	 supraordinate	 concept	 that
solves	 the	 philosophical	 dilemma	 regarding	 the
phenomena	of	free	will.	The	turning	point	in	this
shift	is	labeled	by	Kohut	(1978)	himself	as	coming
first	 in	 1974	 in	 his	 essay,	 “Remarks	 about	 the
Formation	 of	 the	 Self”	 (chapter	 45	 in	 The	Search
for	the	Self).
The	original	concept	of	the	self	of	Kohut	as	a
simpler	experience-near	abstraction,	marked	in	its
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1203
fragmentation	 by	 certain	 clinical	 phenomena,	 is
certainly	
consistent	
with	
traditional
psychoanalytic	theory.	Kohut’s	later	use	of	the	self,
however,	 is	 not	 consistent	 with	 this	 theory,
because	 although	 he	 continues	 to	 derive	 his
concepts	
from	
psychoanalytic	
experience,
postulating	the	self	as	a	center	of	initiative	implies
that	
a	
mysterious	
something	
besides	
the
instinctual	 drives—either	 instead	 of	 them	 or	 in
addition	 to	 them—is	 a	 main	 energic	 spring	 of
human	 behavior	 and	 thought.	 Indeed,	 Kohut
regards	
manifestations	
of	
the	
drives	
as
“disintegration	
products”	
rather	
than	
as
fundamental	parts	of	human	nature.
Stern	(1985)	cites	evidence	that	a	sense	of	an
emergent	self	is	present	from	birth	to	2	months	of
age.	As	Basch	(1991)	puts	it:	“It	is	the	very	activity
of	 extracting	 meaningful	 information	 from	 a
multitude	 of	 stimuli	 and	 experiencing	
the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1204
dependable	 rhythms	 that	 make	 up	 [the	 infant’s]
existence	that	allows	a	sense	of	self	to	emerge”	(p.
6).
From	2	to	6	months	of	age	there	is	an	observed
sense	 of	 core	 relatedness	 and	 an	 apparent
separation	 of	 the	 infant’s	 notion	 of	 its	 own	 body
from	its	notion	of	others.	This	is	the	development
of	 a	 sense	 of	 a	 core	 self,	 the	 point	 at	 which	 the
baby	 learns	 to	 experience	 itself	 as	 a	 center	 of
activity	 and	 perception.	 Basch	 writes,	 “Now	 the
infant	
begins	
to	
organize	
and	
generalize
experience	into	practical	action	schemas,	which	it
then	repeats	when	seemingly	similar	conditions	of
experience	 arise.	 In	 this	 way,	 the	 infant	 encodes
rules	for	behavior	that	greatly	increase	his	or	her
effectiveness;	and,	the	more	effective,	the	stronger
the	infant’s	cohesive	self”	(p.	7).
From	 7	 to	 15	 months	 Stern	 emphasizes	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1205
sense	of	a	subjective	self,	which	actually	develops
out	 of	 the	 intersubjective	 exchange	 or	 affect
attunement	 between	 the	 mother	 and	 the	 infant,
probably	the	most	vital	psychological	nutrient.
The	 sense	 of	 a	 verbal	 self	 appears	 after	 15
months	and	before	that	time	Stern	believes	there
are	
no	
enduring	
specific	
intrapsychic
representations,	
since	
these	
require	
the
development	of	language.	Basch	writes,
Infancy	 ends	 and	 childhood	 begins	 when
reflection	 and	 evocative	 recall	 become	 a
possibility.	The	infant	lives	in	the	present,	he
accommodates	 to	 the	 immediate	 situation,
and	 assimilates	 what	 he	 learns	 from
experience	into	patterns	of	expectation	with
which	 he	 meets	 the	 next	 event.	 The	 unique
capacity	 of	 human	 beings	 for	 unlimited
reflection,	
made	
possible	
by	
symbolic
representation	 of	 events,	 makes	 possible
evocative	recall	and	fantasy	and	the	concepts
of	 past	 and	 future.	 Words	 are	 especially
powerful	 symbols	 that	 can	 be	 used	 to
recreate	the	past	and	to	plan	for	the	future.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1206
An	 inner	 reality	 or	 private	 world	 can	 be
created	that	may	enhance	actual	experience,
falsify	it	through	fantasy,	or	forecast	a	reality
that	has	not	yet	been	experienced	and	may
never	be	experienced.	[pp.	8-9]
Basch	also	mentions	a	sense	of	a	narrative	or
consensually	 validated	 self	 after	 the	 age	 of	 36
months	that	is	not	discussed	by	Stern	(1985).	This
seems	 close	 to	 Sullivan’s	 (1947)	 notion	 of
consensual	
validation,	
but	
it	
includes	
the
contribution	of	privately	thinking	over	as	well	as
sharing	 with	 others	 one’s	 plans,	 activities,	 and
sense	of	what	is	real.
Some	self	psychologists,	such	as	Wolf	(1988),
think	of	the	self	as	if	it	has	a	“structure”	(p.	38),
which	changes	slowly	and	is	made	of	parts	either
well	put	together	(cohesive)	or	easily	fragmenting.
Wolf	 uses	 this	 bipolar	 structure	 definition
metaphorically,	 but	 runs	 the	 danger	 of	 causing
confusion	 with	 Freud’s	 (1923)	 structural	 theory
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1207
and	with	Jung’s	archetypal	self	(Jacoby	1990).	The
reader	must	decide;	my	predilection	is	for	Kohut’s
earlier	emphasis	on	the	sense	of	self	as	explored
by	 the	 therapist’s	 vicarious	 introspection,	 which
keeps	it	more	experience-near.
It	 should	 be	 remembered	 that	 the	 self	 in	 self
psychology	is	not	an	actual	essence	or	contraption
governing	 the	 mind,	 like	 Freud’s	 psychic	 agency
ego,	 but	 is	 a	 bipolar	 organization	 of	 experiences
and	 needs	 that	 may	 be	 classified	 as	 mirroring,
idealizing,	or	twinship	in	nature,	with	some	sort	of
tension	among	these	poles.	To	avoid	confusion,	I
prefer	 the	 term	 “self	 configuration”	 rather	 than
“self	
structure”	
(Wolf	
1988).	
Using	
“self
configuration”	when	discussing	the	psychology	of
the	 self	 rather	 than	 “self’	 or	 “self	 structure”
provides	a	sharper	connotation	of	the	term	“self’
as	it	is	used	in	self	psychology,	separates	it	more
clearly	from	Freud’s	structural	theory,	and	avoids
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1208
some	of	the	Kantian	inconsistencies	as	described
above.

SELF-ANALYSIS
Freud’s	 self-analysis,	 through	 his	 letters	 to
Fliess	 and	 as	 manifested	 in	 The	 Interpretation	 of
Dreams	 (1900),	 was	 heralded	 correctly	 as	 a
gigantic	breakthrough	in	methodology,	and	as	an
act	 of	 personal	 courage,	 daring,	 and	 devotion	 to
truth.	As	early	as	1910	Freud	recommended	self-
analysis	 for	 anyone	 who	 wished	 to	 do	 analytic
work.	Fleming	(1971)	traced	the	development	of
the	
training	
analysis	
from	
this	
original
recommendation	and	identified	the	many	changes
over	 time	 in	 the	 theory	 and	 practice	 of	 training
analysis.	 She	 added	 that	 one	 major	 objective	 of
training	analysis	is	to	encourage	a	lifelong	process
of	 self-analysis	 through	 introspection,	 empathy,
and	interpretation.

analysis	to	occur	after	the	termination	of	training
analysis	(Tyson	1986),	but	later	he	(1937)	became
rather	 pessimistic	 about	 the	 psychoanalytic
process	
and	
recommended	
periodic	
formal
reanalysis	 for	 psychoanalysts	 every	 five	 years.
This	 recommendation,	 although	 it	 is	 based	 on	 a
formidable	argument	by	Freud,	is	largely	ignored
for	 practical	 and	 other	 reasons,	 and	 has	 been
replaced	 by	 general	 agreement	 that	 those
practicing	 psychoanalytic	 therapy	 will	 feel	 a
professional	 obligation	 to	 engage	 in	 self-analysis
whenever	they	become	aware	of	the	interference
of	 countertransference	 difficulties.	 This	 vague
expectation	is	seldom	documented	or	spelled	out
in	the	literature;	it	is	just	assumed	that	everyone
who	 has	 finished	 a	 training	 psychoanalysis
successfully,	 which	 implies	 achieving	 a	 sense	 of
professional	psychoanalytic	identity	and	personal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1212
integrity,	will	somehow	carry	out	this	function	as	a
normal	part	of	everyday	psychoanalytic	work.
Until	 recently	 the	 difficulties	 involved	 in	 self-
analysis	have	tended	to	be	glossed	over,	and	very
few	 authors	 have	 presented	 data	 for	 study.
Elsewhere	 I	 (Chessick	 1990)	 have	 reviewed	 the
literature	 and	 presented	 data	 from	 my	 own	 self-
analysis.	 Wheelis	 (1956)	 cautioned	 that,	 training
analysis	 notwithstanding,	 analysts	 also	 employ
defensive	mechanisms	and	are	personally	affected
by	 the	 nature	 of	 analytic	 work.	 Kramer	 (1959)
concentrated	 on	 the	 so-called	 continuing	 self-
analysis,	 and	 tried	 to	 compare	 and	 review	 the
forces	 operating	 in	 self-analysis	 with	 those	 in	 a
formal	 psychoanalysis,	 singling	 out	 the	 positive
transference,	 the	 reexperience	 of	 old	 conflicts	 in
the	transference	situation,	and	the	function	of	the
analyst	
as	
interpreter.	
She	
claimed	
that
transference	feelings	in	self-analysis	are	directed
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1213
toward	 other	 objects	 and	 emphasized	 the
importance	
of	
identification	
with	
one’s
psychoanalyst	 as	 interpreter,	 so	 that	 the	 same
procedure	 is	 followed	 as	 during	 one’s	 formal
psychoanalysis	 “with	 the	 important	 difference	 of
being	patient	and	analyst	at	the	same	time”	(p.	19).
Freud	(Tyson	1986)	recognized	this	difficulty
as	early	as	1897,	and	Fleming	(1971)	agreed	that
“the	 experience	 of	 resistance	 is	 more	 intense	 in
self-analysis	 than	 with	 an	 external	 analyst
present”	(p.	30).	But,	she	added,	“We	know	it	can
be	overcome	with	persistent	effort	and	in	time”	(p.
31).	 However,	 she	 presented	 no	 data	 to	 support
her	contention.
Kramer	 (1959)	 tried	 to	 draw	 the	 distinction
between	methodical	active	efforts	at	self-analysis
and	 an	 “autoanalytic	 ego	 function”	 that	 involves
“seemingly	 spontaneous	 experiences”	 (p.	 19),	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1214
which	material	that	was	previously	impervious	to
active	 attempts	 at	 self-analysis	 spontaneously,
forcefully,	 and	 convincingly	 broke	 through	 into
her	conscious	mind.	She	left	open	the	question	of
whether	active	self-analytic	efforts	stimulate	this
autoanalytic	 ego	 function.	 No	 other	 author	 has
attempted	 to	 maintain	 this	 distinction	 between
active	 self-analysis	 and	 the	 autoanalytic	 ego
function	because	the	two	occur	together.	Kramer’s
most	important	contribution	was	to	contend	that,
upon	 losing	 the	 analyst	 as	 an	 object	 at	 the
termination	of	one’s	analysis,	a	replacement	takes
place	through	identification;	the	analyst	and	his	or
her	demand	to	analyze	are	set	up	in	the	ego-ideal.
Thus,	
according	
to	
Kramer,	
the	
positive
transference	as	an	incentive	to	face	inner	conflicts
comes	 from	 the	 superego	 and	 ego-ideal	 demand
and	approval.
Myerson	 (1960)	 utilized	 a	 framework	 similar
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1215
to	
that	
of	
Kramer	
and	
described	
an
autobiographical	 episode	 that	 he	 attempted	 to
analyze	by	a	method	he	considered	a	step-by-step
repeat	 of	 the	 analytic	 process.	 He	 conceded,
however,	 that	 discoveries	 in	 self-analysis	 may
“serve	 to	 cover	 deeper	 and	 more	 threatening
meanings”	 (p.	 155).	 For	 him,	 as	 for	 Kramer,	 the
analytic	 ego-ideal	 formed	 from	 an	 identification
with	 one’s	 analyst	 comes	 to	 function	 as	 a
“permanent	part	of	the	post-analytic	personality”
(p.	150).
A	 different	 approach	 to	 the	 study	 of	 self-
analysis	 was	 presented	 by	 Ticho	 (1967),	 who
carried	 out	 discussions	 with	 an	 unspecified
number	of	practicing	analysts,	all	of	whom	had	a
personal	psychoanalysis	that	was	terminated	not
less	 than	 four	 to	 five	 years	 before	 they	 were
questioned.	 Ticho	 believed	 that	 self-analysis
depends	 on	 the	 development	 of	 a	 new	 skill	 that
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1216
evolves	during	one’s	formal	psychoanalysis,	a	skill
based	 on	 the	 formal	 psychoanalytic	 functions	 of
“free	
association,	
objective	
and	
respectful
listening,	and	interpretation”	(p.	309),	but	the	final
organization	 of	 these	 functions	 into	 a	 unified
whole	is	achieved	by	each	analysand	on	his	or	her
own.
Ross	 and	 Kapp	 (1962)	 offered	 a	 specific
technique	for	self-analysis	of	countertransference
by	 using	 the	 psychoanalyst’s	 visual	 images	 in
response	to	the	narration	of	the	patient’s	dreams
(see	COUNTERTRANSFERENCE).	The	analyst	then
associates	to	his	or	her	visual	images	and	applies
self-analysis	 in	 this	 fashion.	 Their	 technique,
although	it	is	quite	clever,	stumbles	on	the	same
problem	of	how	one	validates	the	insights	gained;
a	 sudden	 change	 in	 level	 of	 tension,	 a	 sudden
feeling	 of	 understanding	 the	 self	 better,	 and	 a
spurt	in	the	progress	of	the	patient’s	analysis,	as
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1217
Ross	 and	 Kapp	 conceded,	 can	 occur	 with	 both
correct	and	inexact	interpretations.	These	authors
suggested	a	process	utilizing	a	supervisor	to	cross-
check	the	validity	of	the	insight,	but	this	would	not
be	practical	for	an	ongoing	self-analysis.
Calder	 (1980)	 described	 his	 deliberate	 self-
analysis	 over	 a	 period	 of	 fifteen	 years.	 He	 wrote
down	certain	data	and	his	associations	to	the	data,
then	attempted	to	understand	the	primary	data	on
the	 basis	 of	 the	 associations,	 the	 written	 record
permitting	 comparisons	 at	 different	 times.	 The
primary	data	were	dreams,	followed	by	memories,
daydreams,	 and	 symptoms.	 Calder	 found	 his
dreams	 to	 be	 too	 complex	 and	 less	 useful	 than
expected.	 Memories	 and	 daydreams	 were	 much
more	 useful,	 and	 symptoms	 both	 more	 frequent
and	 more	 useful	 than	 anticipated.	 A	 similar
technique	 was	 first	 proposed	 by	 Pick	 worth
Farrow	 (1926)	 and	 used	 by	 Freud	 (1926),	 who
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1218
also	told	Jones	(1953)	that	he	devoted	the	last	half
hour	of	each	day	to	self-analysis.	Considering	the
incredible	 length	 of	 Freud’s	 working	 day,	 one
would	 like	 to	 know	 a	 lot	 more	 about	 this	 rather
cryptic	remark.
Implicit	in	Calder’s	discussion	is	the	important
differentiation	
between	
one’s	
formal
psychoanalysis	and	self-analysis	in	the	absence	of
an	analyst	as	the	object	of	transference.	Contrary
to	 Kramer	 (1959),	 who,	 as	 mentioned	 above,
reported	 the	 transference	 in	 self-analysis	 taking
place	 to	 “other	 objects,”	 Calder	 claimed	 that
insight	in	self-analysis	can	be	achieved	by	means
other	 than	 the	 analysis	 of	 transference.	 Calder
(1980)	concluded	that,	“self-analysis	is	a	labor	of
love”	 (p.	 19);	 there	 is	 clearly	 an	 important
narcissistic	factor	at	work.
Indeed,	 Warner	 (1980),	 in	 his	 study	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1219
misalliances	 formed	 by	 Guntrip	 with	 both	 of	 his
analysts,	 noted	 that	 self-analysis	 during	 a	 formal
psychoanalysis	 can	 be	 a	 formidable	 resistance.
Abraham	(1919)	first	pointed	this	out,	and	Warner
provided	 a	 striking	 case	 illustration.	 In	 fact,
Pickworth	 Farrow’s	 (1926)	 self-analysis	 was
brought	about	by	his	failures	in	psychoanalysis.	It
is	 in	 this	 area	 of	 the	 narcissistic	 aspects	 of	 self-
analysis	 that	 the	 greatest	 potential	 deceptions	 of
the	procedure	clearly	lie.
Beiser	 (1984)	 attempted	 a	 systematic	 self-
analytic	approach	somewhat	like	Calder’s,	but	did
not	 have	 the	 “patience	 or	 persistence”	 involved
and	 soon	 gave	 it	 up.	 Her	 final	 technique	 was
similar	to	that	of	Myerson	(1960),	using	the	self-
analytic	 process	 in	 situations	 of	 anxiety	 or
distress.	 An	 example	 of	 the	 most	 intensive	 self-
analysis	arising	in	a	situation	of	acute	stress	or	the
sudden	appearance	of	a	symptom	is	presented	by
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1220
Engel	 (1975),	 who	 proceeded	 to	 focus	 his	 self-
analysis	 on	 that	 situation	 and	 its	 anniversary	 (in
Engel’s	case,	the	death	of	his	twin	brother).	Beiser,
Myerson,	and	Engel,	in	contrast	to	Calder,	call	up
self-analysis	
only	
in	
specific	
extraordinary
situations	 rather	 than	 as	 a	 nonspecific	 ongoing
methodical	process.
Kohut	(1984)	suggested	that	the	diminution	of
conscious	 self-analysis	 taking	 place	 in	 some
psychoanalysts	as	they	mature	in	their	profession
is	 not	 necessarily	 deleterious,	 and	 could	 be
evaluated	 as	 a	 positive	 sign	 indicating	 that	 the
total	 functioning	 of	 the	 analyst	 qua	 analyst	 has
improved.	 He	 asked,	 “Has	 [the	 analyst]	 replaced
plain	 self-analysis,	 consciously	 undertaken,	 with
more	nuanced	reactions	that	proceed	silently?”	(p.
224).	Indeed,	for	Kohut	the	continuous	deliberate
exercise	 of	 self-analysis	 represents	 “the	 need	 to
reinstate	the	functions	of	the	selfobject	analyst	in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1221
the	 form	 of	 a	 conscious	 exercise	 of	 self-analysis”
(p.	 170).	 This	 view	 seems	 to	 cast	 doubt	 on	 the
motivation	 for	 regular	 methodical	 self-analysis,
seeing	self-analysis	appropriate	only	as	a	nuanced
reaction	 to	 countertransference,	 and	 suggesting
that	the	decline	of	self-analytic	activity	could	be	a
manifestation	
of	
increasing	
maturity	
and
smoother	preconscious	personality	functioning.
Because	of	the	ever-present	danger	of	defenses
and	resistances	in	self-analysis	already	recognized
by	Freud	(1935),	it	is	not	possible	to	resolve	the
issue	of	whether	self-analysis	can	reveal	genuinely
new	 insights	 or	 consists	 primarily	 of	 reworking
unfinished	
material	
from	
one’s	
training
psychoanalysis.	 It	 also	 seems	 evident	 that
theoretical	 issues	 such	 as	 choices	 between	 self-
psychological	
interpretations	
and	
traditional
oedipal	
interpretations	
as	
applied	
to
psychoanalytic	 data	 cannot	 be	 resolved	 by	 self-
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1222
analysis;	one’s	employment	of	various	theoretical
orientations	 is	 so	 multiply	 determined	 that	 it
cannot	 be	 separated	 convincingly	 from	 defenses
and	compromise	formations.
Above	all	this	stands	the	most	important	goal
of	 self-analysis:	 the	 understanding	 of	 one’s
countertransference	 reactions.	 This	 is	 especially
important	in	the	treatment	of	seriously	disturbed
patients	 who	 become	 disruptive,	 and	 thus	 are
labeled	 borderline,	 often	 as	 a	 response	 to
unconscious	 countertransference	 manifestations
from	 the	 analyst	 that	 are	 experienced	 in	 the
selfobject	transference	as	failures	in	empathy.	For
the	 psychoanalytic	 therapist,	 therefore,	 it	 seems
mandatory	 that	 some	 process	 of	 self-analysis	 be
continued	throughout	his	or	her	professional	life.

SELF	DISORDERS
Kohut	and	Wolf	(1978)	present	a	nosology	of
disorders	of	the	self.	Borrowing	from	their	paper
and	 from	 Kohut	 (1977),	 self	 disorders	 can	 be
divided	into	secondary	and	primary	disturbances.
The	 secondary	 disturbances	 of	 the	 self	 are
reactions	of	a	structurally	undamaged	self	to	the
natural	 vicissitudes	 of	 life	 and	 health.	 This
engenders	 a	 critical	 area	 of	 understanding	 for
crisis	 intervention	 and	 adolescent	 adjustment
problems.	
The	
psychotherapy	
of	
secondary
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1226
disturbances	provides	a	mirroring	and	idealizable
selfobject	 so	 that	 the	 self	 automatically	 firms	 up
(see	 SELFOBJECT).	 The	 patient’s	 ego	 functions
improve	 pari	 passu,	 and	 the	 difficulties	 and
vicissitudes	 can	 be	 handled	 in	 an	 optimal,
relatively	
brief	
fashion,	
without	
much
interpretation.
Primary	 disturbances	 of	 the	 self	 may	 be
divided	into	five	categories.	In	psychoses	there	has
been	 serious	 damage	 to	 the	 nuclear	 self,	 and	 no
substantial	 or	 reliable	 defensive	 structures	 to
cover	 the	 defect,	 whether	 biological	 or	 not,	 have
been	formed.
In	borderline	states	there	is	the	same	defect	as
in	psychoses,	but	it	is	masked	by	complex	defenses
with	which	it	is	unwise	for	the	therapist	to	tamper
except	 to	 improve	 their	 adaptability.	
This
pessimistic	outlook	on	borderline	states	has	been
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1227
challenged	(see	BORDERLINE).
Schizoid	and	paranoid	personalities	wall	off	the
self	and	keep	themselves	at	an	emotional	distance
from	 others	 in	 order	 to	 protect	 against	 “a
permanent	 or	 protracted	 breakup,	 enfeeblement,
or	serious	distortions	of	the	self’	(Kohut	1977,	p.
192)	 (see	 SCHIZOID	 and	 PARANOIA).	 Again,	 we
are	warned	by	Kohut	(1971)	not	to	be	a	bull	in	a
china	shop	in	trying	to	reach	such	patients.	Here
also	I	believe	there	is	excessive	pessimism.	If	the
therapist	is	empathic	and	relatively	patient,	stable
selfobject	transferences	are	sometimes	formed	by
these	patients	and	much	improvement	can	occur.
In	 narcissistic	 behavior	 disorders	 there	 are
symptoms	
of	
perversions,	
addictions,	
and
delinquency,	 but	 the	 self	 is	 only	 temporarily
distorted	 or	 enfeebled.	 These	 patients	 have	 a
significantly	 more	 resilient	 self	 than	 patients	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1228
the	first	three	categories	and	are	more	amenable
to	treatment.	However,	they	are	not	easier	to	treat
than	borderline	or	schizoid	personality	disorders.
In	
narcissistic	
personality	
disorders	
the
problem	is	the	same	as	the	previous	category	with
one	
exception.	
Instead	
of	
predominantly
behavioral	 (see	 ALLOPLASTIC)	 symptoms,	 there
are	 autoplastic	 symptoms	 of	 hypochondria,
malaise,	
boredom,	
depression,	
and
hypersensitivity	 to	 slights.	 According	 to	 Kohut,
only	
narcissistic	
behavior	
and	
personality
disorders	 are	 analyzable,	 as	 the	 self	 in	 the	 first
three	categories	cannot	withstand	the	reactivation
of	 narcissistic	 needs	 without	 fragmentation.	 This
is	 a	 kind	 of	 reverse	 definition	 and	 depends	 on
whether	 or	 not	 stable	 narcissistic	 transferences
form.
Kohut	and	Wolf	(1978)	review	certain	clinical
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1229
syndromes	in	identifying	disorders	of	the	self.	The
understimulated	 self	 is	 due	 to	 a	 chronic	 lack	 of
stimulating	responsiveness	from	the	selfobject	of
childhood.	The	individual	shows	a	lack	of	vitality,
boredom,	 and	 apathy,	 and	 may	 have	 to	 use	 any
excitement	 to	 ward	 off	 painful	 feelings	 of
deadness.
The	fragmenting	self	 occurs	 when	 the	 patient
reacts	to	narcissistic	disappointments,	such	as	the
therapist’s	lack	of	empathy,	by	the	loss	of	a	sense
of	cohesive	self:	disheveled	dress,	posture	and	gait
disturbances,	 vague	 anxiety,	 time	 and	 space
disorientation,	and	hypochondriacal	concerns.	In	a
minor	way	this	occurs	in	all	of	us	when	our	self-
esteem	 has	 been	 taxed	 for	 long	 periods	 and	 no
replenishing	 sustenance	 has	 presented	 itself,	 or
after	a	series	of	failures	that	shake	our	self-esteem.
Kohut	 (1978)	 points	 out	 that	 a	 narcissistic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1230
blow	 can	 lead	 to	 regression	 of	 the	 self	 in	 which
there	 are	 archaic	 but	 cohesive	 forms.	 It	 can	 also
lead	 to	 empty	 depletion	 or	 enfeeblement,	 or	 to
temporary	 fragmentation.	 Such	 regression	 can
manifest	
itself	
by	
a	
shift	
from	
normal
assertiveness	to	narcissistic	rage,	voyeurism	in	the
search	 for	 an	 idealized	 parent	 imago,	 or	 gross
exhibitionism	
in	
the	
search	
for	
mirroring
confirmation	of	the	grandiose	self.
The	
overstimulated	
self	
is	
caused	
by
unempathic	
excessive	
responses	
from	
the
childhood	selfobject,	the	intrusive	overconcerned
narcissistic	excitement	of	neurotic	parents.	If	the
grandiose-exhibitionistic	
pole	
has	
been
overstimulated,	the	patient	is	always	in	danger	of
being	 flooded	 by	 archaic	 greatness	 fantasies,
which	produce	anxiety	and	spoil	the	joy	of	normal
successes.	 Frightened	 by	 their	 intense	 ambition,
these	 patients	 avoid	 normal	 creativity	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1231
productivity	 and	 avoid	 situations	 where	 they
would	attract	attention.
If	the	ideals	pole	is	overstimulated	by	parents
displaying	themselves	to	gain	admiration	from	the
child,	internalization	cannot	occur	and	an	intense
merger	need	remains.	Loss	of	healthy	enthusiasm
for	normal	goals	and	ideals	results.
In	 the	 closely	 related	 overburdened	 self	 the
childhood	selfobject	has	not	been	calm.	There	has
been	 neither	 merger	 with	 the	 calmness	 of	 an
omnipotent	 selfobject	 nor	 development	 of	 an
internalized,	 self-soothing	 capacity.	 A	 world	 that
lacks	 soothing	 selfobjects	 is	 experienced	 as
inimical	and	dangerous.	When	the	therapist	fails	in
empathy,	 the	 patient	 dreams	 of	 living	 in	 a
poisoned	 atmosphere	 surrounded	 by	 snakes	 and
other	 creatures	 and	 complains	 of	 the	 noises,
odors,	and	temperature	changes	in	the	therapist’s
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1232
office	(sec	EMPATHY).
Certain	behavioral	syndromes	in	the	realm	of
the	 disorders	 of	 the	 self	 are	 also	 presented	 by
Kohut	
and	
Wolf	
(1978).	
Mirror-hungry
personalities	 thirst	 for	 selfobjects	 who	 will	 give
them	 confirming	 and	 admiring	 responses.	 “They
are	 impelled	 to	 display	 themselves	 and	 to	 evoke
the	 attention	 of	 others,	 trying	 to	 counteract,
however	
fleetingly,	
their	
inner	
sense	
of
worthlessness	and	lack	of	self-esteem”	(p.	421).
Ideal-hungry	personalities	are	forever	in	search
of	others	whom	they	can	respect	and	admire	for
various	 idealized	 traits,	 such	 as	 prestige,	 power,
beauty,	 intelligence,	 and	 moral	 or	 philosophical
stature.	 Such	 patients	 can	 only	 experience
themselves	as	worthwhile	when	they	are	related
in	some	way	to	these	idealized	selfobjects.
Alter-ego	
personalities	
want	
others	
to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1233
experience	and	confirm	their	feelings,	appearance,
opinions,	 and	 values,	 but	 are	 capable	 of	 being
nourished	
longer	
than	
mirror-hungry
personalities	and	of	forming	friendships	of	a	sort.
These	three	types	of	narcissistic	personalities	are
not	primarily	pathological,	although	they	may	be
so	if	carried	to	an	extreme.
Two	 other	 types	 of	 behavior	 represent
psychopathology.	
Merger-hunger	
personalities
have	a	compelling	need	to	control	their	selfobject,
are	 very	 intolerant	 of	 the	 independence	 of	 the
selfobject,	 are	 very	 sensitive	 to	 separations,	 and

SELF-ESTEEM
(see	also	NARCISSISM)
Self-esteem	is	believed	by	self	psychologists	to
rest	
on	
successful	
childhood	
selfobject
experiences.	 It	 fluctuates	 according	 to	 whether
experiences	in	relations	with	others	are	gratifying
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1235
or	 frustrating	 and	 whether	 an	 individual	 feels
appreciated	 or	 rejected	 by	 other	 people.	 In
traditional	 theory	 it	 is	 also	 dependent	 on	 the
evaluation	by	the	ego-ideal	of	how	close	one	has
come	 to	 one’s	 goals	 and	 aspirations	 (see
CORRUPTION,	EGO-IDEAL).	Self-esteem	is	related
to	pressures	exerted	by	the	superego	on	the	ego;	if
the	superego	is	highly	sadistic,	there	is	a	continual
lowering	
of	
self-esteem,	
regardless	
of	
the
individual’s	successes.	This	represents	aggression
directed	by	the	sadistic	superego	toward	the	ego.
Kernberg	 (1991)	 explains	 that	 self-esteem	 may
also	 be	 lowered	 by	 “lack	 of	 gratification	 of
instinctual	 needs	 of	 both	 a	 libidinal	 and	 an
aggressive	 nature,	 so	 that	 unconscious	 ego
defenses	that	repress	awareness	and	expression	of
such	instinctual	needs	will	impoverish	the	ego	of
gratifying	experiences	and	thus	‘deplete’	libidinal
self-investment	 and	 diminish	 self-esteem	 …	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1236
images	in	our	mind	of	those	we	love	and	by	whom
we	feel	loved	strengthen	our	self-love”	(p.	143).
Freud	 (1914)	 maintains	 that	 there	 are	 three
aspects	to	self-esteem.	One	part	is	“the	residue	of
infantile	 narcissism,”	 another	 arises	 out	 of	 the
omnipotent	experience	of	fulfilling	one’s	ego-ideal,
and	a	third	part	“proceeds	from	the	satisfaction	of
object	libido”	(p.	100).	Self-esteem	can	be	thought
of	 as	 a	 state	 of	 being	 on	 good	 terms	 with	 one’s
superego.	 The	 importance	 of	 self-esteem	 as	 a
motivation	for	human	action	cannot	be	sufficiently
emphasized,	
as

SELFOBJECT
An	 object	 (see	 OBJECT)	 may	 be	 defined	 as	 a
selfobject	when	it	is	experienced	intrapsychically
as	 providing	 functions	 in	 an	 interpersonal
relationship	that	add	to	or	maintain	the	cohesive
sense	 of	 self.	 This	 includes	 affect	 attunement,
consensual	 validation,	 tension	 regulation	 and
soothing,	
recognition	
of	
one’s	
autonomous
potential,	 and	 restoration	 of	 a	 temporarily
threatened	 fragmentation	 of	 the	 self	 through	 a
variety	 of	 activities	 and	 comments.	 We	 have	 all
experienced	 others	 as	 selfobjects,	 and	 Kohut
(1984)	 maintains	 that	 we	 need	 selfobjects	 from
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1238
the	beginning	to	the	end	of	life.	Kohut	mentioned
both	structure-building	and	structure-maintaining
selfobject	 experiences.	 Developmental	 phase-
appropriate	
and,	
later	
on,	
age-appropriate
selfobject	 functions	 form	 the	 mainspring	 of	 an
individual’s	self-love,	self-esteem,	and	self-respect.
There	 remains	 a	 debate	 in	 the	 literature
(Shane	1991)	as	to	whether	there	is	a	difference
between	 an	 object	 experience	 and	 a	 selfobject
experience.	An	object	experience	might	be	thought
of	as	a	situation	in	which	a	cohesive	self	expresses
itself	affectively	and	tries	to	bring	about	a	certain
outcome	 or	 solve	 a	 certain	 problem.	 A	 selfobject
experience	 involves	 a	 self	 that	 is	 threatened	 and
requires	 a	 particular	 function	 to	 make	 up	 for	 an
inadequacy	 or	 weakness	 in	 the	 self	 structure.
Shane	paraphrases	Basch	as	maintaining	that	the
difference	 relates	 “exclusively	 to	 the	 self	 state	 of
the	individual,	whether	the	self	state	is	cohesive	or
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1239
shaky”	(p.	31).
Wolf	 (1988)	 presents	 a	 classification	 of	 age-
appropriate	selfobject	needs,	defined	as	“normally
required	 selfobject	 experiences	 that	 fit	 the	 age-
dependent	requirements	to	sustain	self-cohesion”
(p.	 56).	 An	 infant	 needs	 experiences	 with	 a	 real
person	who	provides	certain	responses	that	fit	the
early	 stages	 of	 the	 emerging	 sense	 of	 self,	 as
defined	by	Stern	(see	SELF).	An	adolescent	needs
selfobject	 experiences	 with	 peers,	 symbols,	 and
the	 adolescent	 subculture.	 An	 adult	 needs
selfobject	 experiences	 with	 other	 individuals	 or
symbols,	 “such	 as	 [those]	 provided	 by	 art,
literature,	 music,	 religion,	 ideas,	 which	 by	 their
availability	 function	 as	 selfobjects	 for	 that
particular	 adult.	 …	 These	 experiences	 are	 only
partly	 conscious,	 but	 their	 effect	 on	 the	 self	 is
powerfully	strengthening”	(p.	54).

SELF	PSYCHOLOGY
(KOHUT)
Self	 psychology	 refers	 to	 the	 theory	 and
practice	 of	 psychoanalysis	 advocated	 by	 Heinz
Kohut	 (1913-1981).	 I	 (Chessick	 1985)	 have
described	it	in	detail	elsewhere	and	have	referred
to	it	under	various	concepts	in	this	dictionary	(see
BIPOLAR	 SELF,	 FRAGMENTATION,	 GRANDIOSE
SELF,

OPTIMAL	FRUSTRATION,	SELF	DISORDERS,	SELF,
SELFOBJECT).
Our	 self-assessment	 becomes	 closer	 to	 the
assessment	 of	 others	 as	 our	 narcissism	 matures
through	 a	 series	 of	 developmental	 pathways.	 In
response	to	stimuli	from	the	environment	and	due
to	 an	 epigenetic	 preprogramming	 involving	 our
heredity,	these	developmental	pathways	lead	from
autoerotism,	to	primary	narcissism—in	which	the
infant	 blissfully	 experiences	 the	 world	 as	 being
itself—and	then,	due	to	inevitable	disappointment
in	such	narcissistic	omnipotence,	the	formation	of
the	grandiose	self	and	the	idealized	parent	imago.
The	grandiose	self	implies	the	conviction	of	being
very	powerful,	if	not	omnipotent,	with	a	demand
for	 mirroring	 confirmation	 by	 the	 selfobject;	 the
idealized	parent	imago	attributes	all	omnipotence
to	 a	 magical	 figure,	 which	 is	 then	 viewed	 as	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1242
selfobject	 to	 be	 controlled	 and	 fused	 with	 this
imago.	 By	 a	 series	 of	 microinternalizations	 in	 an
appropriate	 environment,	 the	 grandiose	 self
becomes	 incorporated	 into	 the	 ego	 or	 self	 as
ambition	(the	ambitions	pole	of	the	self),	a	drive	or
push	 that	 can	 be	 realistically	 sublimated	 and	 is
itself	
drive-channeling	
and	
drive-controlling,
resulting	 in	 motivated	 enthusiastic	 activity.	 The
idealized	 parent	 imago	 becomes	 infused	 into	 the
ego-ideal	(or,	in	the	later	theory,	the	other	pole	of
the	 self;	 see	 BIPOLAR	 SELF),	 which	 attracts	 the
individual	 toward	 certain	 goals	 and	 performs	 a
drive-curbing	
function.	
The	
proper
microinternalization	 of	 these	 formations	 leads
ultimately	by	further	transformations	to	a	sense	of
humor,	 empathy,	 wisdom,	 acceptance	 of	 the
transience	of	life,	and	even	to	creativity	within	the
limitations	of	the	individual.
As	a	consequence	of	developmental	arrest	and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1243
failure	 to	 properly	 integrate	 these	 archaic
structures,	
characteristic	
“selfobject
transferences”	 (Kohut	 1977),	 previously	 called
“narcissistic	transferences”	(Kohut	1971)	occur	as
the	result	of	the	amalgamation	of	the	unconscious
archaic	narcissistic	structures	(grandiose	self	and
idealized	
parent	
imago)	
with	
the	
psychic
representation	of	the	analyst,	under	the	pressure
of	 the	 need	 to	 relieve	 the	 unfulfilled	 narcissistic
needs	 of	 childhood.	 The	 goal	 of	 the	 idealizing
selfobject	transference	is	to	share	magically,	via	a
merger,	 in	 the	 power	 and	 omnipotence	 of	 the
therapist.	 Occurring	 as	 the	 result	 of	 therapeutic
mobilization	of	the	idealized	parent	imago	are	two
basic	types	of	such	transferences,	with	a	variety	of
gradations	in	between.	The	most	obvious	type	is	a
later	 formation,	 apparently	 based	 on	 a	 failure	 of
idealization	of	the	father,	that	stresses	the	search
for	 an	 idealized	 parent,	 which	 the	 patient	 must
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1244
attach	 himself	 or	 herself	 to	 in	 order	 to	 feel
approved	 and	 protected.	 A	 more	 archaic	 type	 of
selfobject	transference	may	appear,	or	be	hidden
under	the	other	type;	this	transference	is	related
to	a	failure	with	the	mother,	in	which	the	stress	is
on	 ecstatic	 merger	 and	 mystical	 union	 with	 the
godlike	idealized	parent.
Once	 such	 a	 transference	 has	 been	 formed,
clinical	 signs	 of	 its	 disturbance	 are	 a	 cold,	 aloof,
angry,	 raging	 withdrawal,	 which	 represents	 a
swing	
to	
the	
grandiose	
self;	
feelings	
of
fragmentation	 and	 hypochondria	 due	 to	 the
separation;	
and	
the	
creation	
of	
erotized
replacement	 by	 often	 frantic	 activities	 and
fantasies,	 especially	 those	 involving	 voyeurism,
but	with	many	variations.
The	
typical	
countertransference	
to	
the
idealizing	selfobject	transferences	occurs	through
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1245
the	 mobilization	 of	 the	 archaic	 grandiose	 self,	 in
whatever	 unanalyzed	 residue	 is	 present,	 in	 the
therapist;	 this	 leads	 to	 an	 embarrassed	 and
defensive	 “straight-arming”	 of	 the	 patient	 by
denying	the	patient’s	idealization,	joking	about	it,
or	 trying	 vigorously	 to	 interpret	 it	 away.	 Such
countertransference	 produces	 in	 the	 patient	 the
typical	signs	of	disturbance	mentioned	above.
Three	forms	of	mirror	selfobject	transference
are	seen	as	a	result	of	the	therapeutic	mobilization
of	 the	 repressed	 and	 unintegrated	 archaic
grandiose	 self	 (see	 MIRROR	 TRANSFERENCE	 for
details).	 In	 the	 archaic-merger	 type,	 the	 patient
experiences	 the	 therapist	 as	 part	 of	 himself	 or
herself,	 expects	 the	 therapist	 to	 know	 what	 is	 in
his	 or	 her	 mind	 and	 what	 he	 or	 she	 wants,	 and
demands	total	control.	In	the	alter-ego	or	twinship
type	of	mirror	transference,	the	patient	insists	that
the	 therapist	 is	 like	 or	 similar	 to	 him	 or	 her
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1246
psychologically	 or	 that	 the	 therapist	 and	 the
patient	look	alike.	This	was	later	separated	out	by
Kohut	 (1984)	 as	 a	 third	 form	 of	 selfobject
transference.	 In	 the	 third	 type	 of	 mirror
transference,	 or	 mirror	 transference	 proper,	 the
patient	 recognizes	 that	 the	 therapist	 looks
different,	but	insists	on	assigning	to	the	therapist
the	 sole	 task	 of	 praising,	 echoing,	 and	 mirroring
the	patient’s	performance	and	greatness.
In	 clinical	 work	 we	 can	 pick	 up	 certain	 signs
that	selfobject	transferences	have	formed.	We	note
that	the	patient	reacts	to	our	empathic	lapses,	or
to	cancellations	and	vacations,	or	even	to	the	gap
of	 time	 between	 sessions,	 with	 (a)	 perverse	 or
other	 sexual	 acting	 out,	 (b)	 hypochondriasis,	 (c)
irritable	 and	 arrogant	 behavior,	 (d)	 painfully
depressive	 moods,	 and	 (e)	 a	 sense	 of	 emptiness
and	depletion.	These	signs	may	be	understood	as
manifestations	of	partial	fragmentation	of	the	self
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1247
due	
to	
the	
disruption	
of	
the	
selfobject
transferences,	 and	 as	 attempts	 to	 restitute	 and
discharge	the	painful	tensions	involved.
The	purpose	of	the	selfobject	transferences	is
to	 relieve	 the	 unfulfilled	 narcissistic	 needs	 of
childhood	for	the	selfobject	to	joyfully	accept	and
confirm	 the	 child’s	 grandiosity,	 and	 for	 “an
omnipotent	surrounding,”	which	Kohut	and	Wolf
(1978)	regard	as	healthy	needs	that	had	not	been
responded	to	in	early	life.	When	these	responses
are	forthcoming,	a	temporary	sense	of	narcissistic
peace	and	equilibrium	results.
Phase-inappropriate	 disappointment	 in	 the
idealized	 parent	 imago	 that	 occurs	 very	 early	 in
experiences	 with	 the	 mother	 leads	 to	 a	 need	 for
optimal	soothing	from	the	idealized	parent	and	a
search	 for	 drugs,	 with	 a	 malfunctioning	 stimulus
barrier.	Such	patients	tend	to	become	addicted	to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1248
psychotherapy	 for	 just	 this	 reason.	 In	 the	 late
preoedipal	
period,	
phase-inappropriate
disappointment	
causes	
a	
resexualization	
of
pregenital	 drives	 and	 derivatives,	 with	 a	 high
incidence	of	perversions	in	fantasy	or	acts.	In	early
latency	the	severe	disappointment	in	the	idealized
oedipal	object	undoes	the	recently	established	and
thus	precariously	idealized	superego.	This	leads	to
the	search	for	an	external	object	of	perfection,	an
intense	 search	 for	 and	 dependency	 on	 idealized
selfobjects,	 which	 are	 conceived	 as	 missing
segments	 of	 the	 psychic	 structure.	 For	 such
patients,	each	success	can	give	only	transient	good
feelings	 but	 does	 not	 add	 to	 the	 patient’s	 self-
esteem	because	the	patient	is	fixed	on	finding	an
idealized	parent	imago	outside	of	himself—he	is	at
a	developmental	stage	such	that	he	must	have	an
outside	source	of	approval.
In	the	neurotic	transferences,	idealization	(see
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1249
IDEALIZATION)	does	not	lose	touch	entirely	with
the	realistic	features	and	limitations	of	the	object.
In	 other	 neurotic	 situations,	 idealization	 can
represent	a	projection	of	the	analysand’s	idealized
superego	onto	the	analyst	and	form	a	part	of	the
positive	 transference,	 or	 defensive	 idealizations
can	 form	 against	 transference	 hostility.	 In	 the
narcissistic	 transferences,	 there	 is	 a	 sense	 of	 a
vague	idealization,	which	can	lead	to	the	extreme
delusion	 that	 the	 therapist	 is	 godlike.	 An	 eerie
quality	 of	 unreasonable	 exultation	 is	 present,	 to
which	 the	 therapist	 reacts	 with	 embarrassment
and	negativism	if	he	or	she	does	not	understand
the	 material	 conceptually.	 The	 intensity	 of	 the
distortion	 gives	 the	 therapist	 an	 idea	 of	 how
desperate	the	patient	is.
The	grandiose	sell	and	idealized	parent	imago
are	
either	
split	
off	
or	
repressed	
if	
the
developmental	 line	 of	 narcissism	 is	 interfered
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1250
with.	If	they	are	split	off,	one	gets	Kohut’s	(1971)
“vertical	split”	in	which	there	is	a	barrier	between
two	 conscious	 parts	 of	 the	 self	 that	 are	 not
integrated.	The	patient	acts	as	if	one	aspect	of	the
self	does	not	know	about	the	other.
If	 these	 primitive	 narcissistic	 structures	 are
repressed,	we	observe	reaction	formations	or	the
sudden	 emergence	 of	 many	 vague	 symptoms.
Some	of	these	are	(a)	fear	of	the	loss	of	the	real
self	 to	 ecstatic	 merger	 with	 the	 idealized	 parent,
God,	 or	 the	 universe;	 (b)	 fear	 of	 loss	 of	 contact
with	reality	due	to	intense	unrealistic	grandiosity;
(c)	 shame	 and	 self-consciousness	 consequent	 to
dealing	with	the	intrusion	of	exhibitionistic	libido;
and	 (d)	 hypochondriasis,	 which	 represents	 an
elaboration	 by	 the	 ego	 as	 disintegration	 anxiety
appears;	body	parts	become	crystallization	points
for	 hypochondriacal	 worry,	 an	 attempt	 to
reconstitute	
and	
explain	
the	
incipient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1251
fragmentation	of	the	self.	In	these	disorders,	acting
out	 represents	 a	 partial	 breakthrough	 of	 the
grandiose	self	and	may	be	life-threatening.
In	 working	 with	 self	 disorders,	 the	 therapist
must	 participate	 by	 dealing	 especially	 with
responses	 to	 separation	 and	 disappointments	 in
the	 transferences,	 and	 by	 staying	 nearer	 to
everyday	
experiences	
rather	
than	
deep
interpretations	of	the	past.	In	fact,	interpretations
of	 the	 past	 may	 come	 as	 a	 narcissistic	 injury
because	 the	 patient	 can’t	 do	 much	 about	 it.	 The
therapist	takes	a	benign	approach	and	fosters	the
development	 of	 the	 transference	 relationship	 by
patient,	
craftsmanlike	
work.	
Minor
disappointments	in	the	narcissistic	transferences,
followed	by	characteristic	reactions	in	the	patient,
must	be	calmly	explained	to	the	patient.	Without
this	 conceptual	 understanding,	 the	 temptation
occurs	 to	 launch	 all	 kinds	 of	 extratherapeutic
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1252
activities	 toward	 the	 patient.	 Some	 of	 these
temptations	
are	
based	
directly	
on
countertransference	hostility	and	some	are	based
on	 reaction	 formations	 to	 this	 hostility;	 but	 the
principle	 remains	 that	 the	 therapist’s	 temptation
to	 step	 outside	 the	 role	 of	 the	 calm,	 benign
craftsman	is	based	on	a	misunderstanding	of	what
is	 going	 on	 in	 the	 therapy	 and	 is	 motivated	 by
countertransference.	 There	 is	 no	 end	 to	 the
rationalizations	
that	
the	
unanalyzed
psychotherapist	may	present	to	himself	or	herself
to	 justify	 this	 exploitation	 of	 and	 retaliation
toward	the	patient.
To	 protect	 themselves	 against	 rejection	 and
further	 narcissistic	 wounding,	 patients	 with	 an
insufficient	 ego-ideal	 tend	 to	 withdraw	 into
grandiosity—which	 bothers	 and	 irritates	 people
and	produces	further	rejection,	leading	to	further
withdrawal.	 Clinically,	 narcissistic	 peace	 can	 be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1253
established	 with	 concomitant	 improved	 function
when	the	idealizing	transference	occurs,	but	such
transferences	may	also	lead	to	a	fear	of	loss	of	ego
boundaries	 and	 fusion	 if	 the	 wish	 to	 merge	 with
the	 idealized	 parent	 imago	 is	 so	 strong,	 and	 so
may	result	in	a	negative	therapeutic	reaction.	The
patient	must	resist	the	threatened	merging	out	of
fear	of	loss	of	the	autonomy	of	the	self.
In	 Kohut’s	 (1977,	 1984)	 later	 “psychology	 of
the	self	in	the	broad	sense,”	a	complementary	role
in	development	is	given	to	the	oedipal	phase.	Here,
it	 is	 the	 response	 of	 the	 parents	 to	 the	 child’s
libidinal	
and	
aggressive	
and	
exhibitionistic
strivings—their	pride	and	mirroring	confirmation
of	
the	
child’s	
development—that	
permits
internalizations	 to	 occur	 smoothly.	 To	 clarify,	 in
Freud’s	theory,	for	example,	it	is	the	boy’s	fear	of
castration	by	the	father	that	causes	him	to	identify
with	 the	 aggressor	 and	 internalize	 the	 values	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1254
the	 father.	 For	 Kohut,	 it	 is	 at	 the	 same	 time	 the
father’s	pride	in	the	boy’s	emerging	assertiveness,
as	it	shows	itself	in	the	boy’s	oedipal	strivings	and
imitative	
efforts,	
that	
softens	
the	
boy’s
disappointment	of	not	possessing	the	mother	and
enables	an	internalization	of	the	idealized	parent
imago	as	a	nuclear	pole	of	the	self.	If,	for	example,
the	father	or	mother	withdraws	from	the	child	as	a
response	 to	 their	 horror	 of	 his	 oedipal	 strivings,
this	 internalization	 cannot	 occur,	 and	 the	 child
remains	 fixed	 in	 development	 on	 finding	 some
individual	outside	of	himself	to	which	he	attaches
the	idealized	parent	imago.
Some	authors	claim	that	Freud	would	not	have
considered	 Kohut’s	 psychology	 of	 the	 self	 a
complementary	theory.	Kohut’s	(1977)	procedure
is	 based	 on	 the	 Zeigarnik	 phenomenon,	 which
postulates	 some	 kind	 of	 inner	 motivation	 of
undeveloped	
structures	
to	
resume	
their
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1255
development	 when	 given	 the	 opportunity;	 the
energy	 behind	 this	 motivation	 has	 nothing	 to	 do
with	Freud’s	instinctual	drives,	and	the	origin	of	it
is	 not	 explained.	 The	 basis	 of	 therapy	 in	 the
psychology	 of	 the	 self	 assumes	 that	 proper
understanding	 and	 development	 of	 “selfobject
transferences,”	 or	 transferencelike	 structures	 in
the	 treatment,	 make	 it	 possible	 for	 this	 force	 to
take	over	and	thus	for	development	of	the	self	to
resume	 via	 transmuting	 internalization;	 this	 is
clearly	
fundamentally	
different	
from	
the
resolution	 of	 conflicts	 via	 interpretation	 of	 a
transference	 neurosis.	 Thus	 Slap	 and	 Levine
(1978),	 in	 a	 rather	 extreme	 statement,	 write,
“Although	 Kohut	 refers	 to	 it	 as	 a	 psychoanalysis,
his	 therapeutic	 method	 depends	 on	 suggestion
and	learning,	but	not	insight,	conflict	resolution,	or
making	the	unconscious	conscious”	(p.	507).
Bacal	(1991)	distinguishes	five	characteristics
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1256
that	 separate	 self	 psychology	 from	 classical
psychoanalysis:	 (1)	 instinctual	 motivation	 is	 not
thought	of	as	a	central	factor	in	development	and
pathogenesis;	(2)	there	is	a	shift	to	a	“multi-body
psychology”	(p.	38);	(3)	the	subjective	sense	of	self
is	 placed	 consistently	 at	 the	 center;	 (4)	 the
selfobject	 relationship	 is	 seen	 as	 a	 central
significant	 form	 of	 relationship	 between	 the	 self
and	the	other;	and	(5)	there	is	a	“transformation	of
the	 traditional	 perspectives	 on	 narcissism”:

development	 or	 a	 defense	 against	 anxieties
associated	
with	
object-instinctual	
strivings,
whereas	“self	psychology	regards	narcissism	as	a
self	 defect	 or	 self	 distortion	 resulting	 from	 a
significant	failure	of	selfobjects	and	the	mounting
of	 defenses	 against	 the	 anxieties	 associated	 with
the	expression	of	selfobject	needs”	(p.	38).

SHAME
No	 one	 has	 improved	 on	 Samuel	 Johnson’s
(1773)	definition	of	shame:	“The	passion	felt	when
reputation	 is	 supposed	 to	 be	 lost;	 the	 passion
expressed	sometimes	by	blushes”	(p.	1763).	Piers
and	 Singer	 (1953)	 produced	 a	 classic	 study	 of
shame	and	guilt.	Shame	is	felt	when	one	does	not
live	 up	 to	 the	 standards	 of	 one’s	 ego-ideal,
whereas	guilt	is	the	affect	experienced	when	one
transgresses	 the	 rules	 and	 regulations	 of	 the
superego.	 So	 transgressions	 of	 moral	 codes	 and
laws	result	in	the	feeling	of	guilt;	lack	of	tact	and
errors	in	taste	produce	shame.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1259
The	concept	of	shame	is	closely	connected	with
the	
concept	
of	
narcissistic	
wounding	
(see
NARCISSISM).	Shame	compels	us	to	see	ourselves
through	 the	 eyes	 of	 others	 and	 may	 increase
insight.	 Moore	 and	 Fine	 (1990)	 eloquently
describe	 shame	 as	 referring	 to	 “embarrassment,
humiliation,	 mortification,	 and	 disgrace—	 that
accompany	the	feeling	of	being	rejected,	ridiculed,
exposed,	or	losing	the	respect	of	others”	(p.	181).
Shame	may	be	a	warning	of	anticipated	rejection
of	 one’s	 grandiosity	 or	 exhibitionism,	 or	 become
part	of	one’s	character	as	a	helpful	defense	against
the	expression	of	such	wishes.
Psychotherapists	 should	 always	 remember
that	 shame	 or	 humiliation	 is	 extremely	 painful,
and	 patients	 unavoidably	 suffer	 a	 lot	 of	 these
affects	in	the	process	of	treatment.

SPLITTING
(KERNBERG)
Splitting	is	a	term	used	differently	by	authors
in	 object	 relations	 theory	 (Pruyser	 1975)	 (see
OBJECT	 RELATIONS	 THEORY).	 It	 represents	 a
failure	 in	 the	 synthesizing	 function	 of	 the	 ego,
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1261
which	 Freud	 (1940)	 related	 to	 disavowal	 but
which	 has	 come	 to	 have	 more	 preoedipal
connotations.	It	is	crucial	to	the	turning	away	from
reality	 in	 any	 condition,	 including	 dreams,
perversions,	 neuroses,	 and	 psychoses,	 and	 it
enables	these	processes	to	occur.	The	concept	of
splitting	 lies	 at	 the	 basis	 of	 Otto	 Kernberg’s
theories	of	development	and	is	the	concept	central
to	his	long	experience	with,	understanding	of,	and
treatment	 of	 borderline	 patients.	 At	 present
Kernberg	 is	 Associate	 Chairman	 and	 Medical
Director	of	The	New	York	Hospital-Cornell	Medical
Center	and	Professor	of	Psychiatry	at	the	Cornell
University	Medical	College.	He	is	also	Training	and
Supervising	 Analyst	 of	 the	 Columbia	 University
Center	for	Psychoanalytic	Training	and	Research,
and	the	recipient	of	many	awards	for	his	work.
Kernberg	 (1976)	 postulates	 five	 stages	 of
development	of	internalized	object	relations.	The
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1262
first,	or	primary	undifferentiated,	stage	resembles
Mahler’s	 (1975)	 phase	 of	 normal	 autism.	 Object
relations	
theory	
lends	
itself	
well	
to	
the
organization	 of	 direct	 observations	 of	 the	 initial
preoedipal	 mother-infant	 dyad,	 during	 which
there	 are	 no	 self	 or	 object	 representations	 (or
images,	as	they	are	called	by	Kernberg).	This	stage
lasts	about	a	month	or	two	and	leads	to	the	second
stage,	 which	 corresponds	 to	 Mahler’s	 symbiotic
phase	 between	 the	 ages	 of	 2	 and	 6	 months,	 plus
her	
first	
or	
“differentiation”	
subphase	
of
separation-individuation	 from	 6	 to	 9	 months	 of
age.
In	 this	 stage,	 there	 are	 representations,	 but
these	are	roughly	undifferentiated	self	and	object
constellations	 separated	 only	 into	 good	 and	 bad;
consequently	 there	 is	 no	 differentiation	 between
self	 and	 object.	 Kernberg	 here	 postulates	 a
primary	
undifferentiated	
good	
self-object
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1263
representation	 or	 constellation	 associated	 with
pleasurable	 experiences	 (pure	 pleasure	 ego)	 and
invested	
with	
libido,	
and	
a	
primary
undifferentiated	 bad	 self-object	 representation
associated	with	pain	and	frustration	and	invested
with	 aggression.	 Kernberg’s	 conception	 of	 “self-
object-affect	 unit”	 should	 not	 be	 confused	 with
Kohut’s	 “selfobject,”	 which	 is	 an	 experience-near
conception	 coming	 from	 an	 entirely	 different
methodology	 and	 theory	 (see	 SELFOBJECT,	 SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).
The	 third	 stage,	 which	 follows	 the	 first
rumblings	
of	
separation-individuation	
that
occurred	 from	 the	 age	 of	 6	 to	 9	 months,	 begins
when	 the	 self	 and	 object	 representations	 have
been	 differentiated	 within	 the	 two	 primary
constellations	(good	and	bad)	that	predominate	in
the	 second	 stage,	 as	 described	 above.	 It	 ends
somewhere	 in	 the	 third	 year	 of	 life,	 with	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1264
eventual	 integration	 of	 good	 and	 bad	 self
representations	 into	 an	 integrated	 self-concept
and	 the	 integration	 of	 good	 and	 bad	 object
representations	 into	 total	 object	 representations.
The	achievement	of	object	constancy	and	the	firm
capacity	 to	 distinguish	 the	 inner	 from	 the	 outer
world	 (stable	 ego	 boundaries)	 depends	 on	 this
stage.
Kernberg	(1976)	postulates	that	“pathological
fixation	 and/or	 regression	 to	 this	 stage	 of
development	 of	 internalized	 object	 relations
determines	 borderline	 personality	 organization”
(p.	 65).	 He	 explains	 that	 in	 this	 third	 stage,	 “the
separation	of	libidinally	invested	and	aggressively
invested	self-	and	object-representations	becomes
strengthened	
by	
active	
utilization	
of	
the
mechanism	of	splitting,	which	is	geared	to	protect
the	ideal,	good	relationship	with	the	mother	from
‘contamination’	 by	 bad	 self-representations	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1265
bad	representations	of	her”	(p.	67).	Normally	this
splitting	decreases,	but	Kernberg	continues	with	a
statement	 meant	 to	 specifically	 delineate	 the
intrapsychic	 pathology	 that	 predominates	 in	 the
borderline	personality:	“The	main	objective	of	the
defensive	 constellation	 centering	 on	 splitting	 in
the	borderline	personality	organization	is	to	keep
separate	 the	 aggressively	 determined	 and	 the
libidinally	 determined	 intrapsychic	 structures
stemming	 from	 early	 object	 relations”	 (p.	 67).
Although	by	the	end	of	the	third	stage	in	normal
development	
there	
is	
a	
firm	
self-concept
differentiated	from	object	representations,	within
the	self-concept	there	is	still	some	splitting	of	good
and	bad	self	representations.	Similarly,	within	the
object	representations	“at	first	only	representing
mother,	and	then	also	father,	siblings,	etc.”	(pp.	66-
67),	good	and	bad	object	representations	coexist
by	
splitting,	
which,	
however,	
is	
gradually
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1266
diminishing.
The	fourth	stage,	beginning	in	the	latter	part	of
the	 third	 year	 of	 life	 and	 lasting	 through	 the
oedipal	period,	“is	characterized	by	the	integration
of	 libidinally	 invested	 and	 aggressively	 invested
self-representations	 into	 the	 definite	 self-system,
and	 of	 libidinally	 invested	 and	 aggressively
invested	
object-images	
into	
‘total’	
object-
representations”	 (Kernberg	 1976,	 p.	 67).	 In	 this
phase	 the	 ego	 and	 superego	 as	 intrapsychic
structures	are	consolidated.	The	typical	pathology
in	 this	 stage	 is	 represented	 by	 the	 neuroses	 and
the	organization	of	character	pathology	Kernberg
calls	 higher	 level,	 where	 “pathogenic	 conflicts
typically	 occur	 between	 the	 ego	 and	 a	 relatively
well-integrated	but	excessively	strict	and	punitive
superego”	(p.	67).
One	variant	of	character	pathology	forming	at
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1267
this	stage	is	the	narcissistic	personality,	which	is,
according	to	Kernberg,	an	abnormal	consolidation,
characterized	 by	 the	 formation	 of	 a	 pathological
grandiose	
self,	
embedded	
in	
a	
defense
organization	 “similar	 to	 that	 of	 the	 borderline
personality	
organization”	
(p.	
68),	
due	
to
regression	back	to	the	third	stage.
Thus,	 according	 to	 Kernberg,	 the	 coalescence
of	 the	 good	 and	 bad	 self	 representations	 into	 a
definite,	integrated,	relatively	realistic	overall	self
representation	in	the	ego,	and	the	coalescence	of
the	 good	 and	 bad	 object	 representations	 into	 a
definite,	integrated,	relatively	realistic	overall	self
representation	in	the	ego,	is	the	task	of	the	fourth
stage,	 and	 fails	 in	 the	 borderline	 patient.	 This
failure	 may	 be	 due	 to	 congenital	 ego	 defect	 or
excessive	aggression,	fixing	the	patient	in	the	third
stage	or	causing	regression	back	to	it,	and	making
the	 fourth	 stage	 impossible.	 This	 coalescence	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1268
related	 to	 Hartmann	 and	 colleagues’	 (1949)
concept	of	neutralization	(see	NEUTRALIZATION),
freeing	energy	for	ego	functioning	and	the	higher
level	 exercise	 of	 repression,	 that	 is,	 setting	 up
countercathexes;	if	it	fails,	the	weakened	ego	must
utilize	splitting	as	its	principal	defense,	setting	in
motion	 a	 downward	 spiral	 of	 further	 weakness
and	more	splitting.
The	 fifth	 and	 final	 developmental	 stage,	 from
age	5	to	7,	is	the	resolution	of	the	oedipal	phase,
the	 consolidation	 of	 the	 superego,	 a	 diminished
sharp	 opposition	 between	 the	 ego	 and	 the
superego	 leading	 to	 more	 internal	 harmony,	 and
finally	 the	 formation	 and	 consolidation	 of	 ego
identity.	 Notice	 that	 in	 normal	 development,
according	to	Kernberg,	splitting	begins	around	the
third	 month,	 peaks	 several	 months	 later,	 and
gradually	disappears	at	the	end	of	the	second	year
and	beginning	of	the	third	year	of	life,	after	which
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1269
there	is	the	development	of	repression	and	higher-
level	defenses.
In	 his	 conceptions	 of	 the	 superego	 and
narcissism,	 Kernberg	 shifts	 from	 these	 more
Kleinian	 concepts	 to	 a	 heavier	 reliance	 on	 the
work	 of	 Jacobson	 (1964).	 However,	 Jacobson
avoided	
rigid	
stepwise	
descriptions	
and
“considered	parental	interaction	with	the	child	of
crucial	 importance	 rather	 than	 those	 conflicts
which	 go	 on	 between	 ‘primitive	 introjects’	 ”
(Abend	et	al.	1983,	p.	163).
According	to	Kernberg,	the	main	components
of	the	superego	are	built	during	the	second	to	fifth
year,	 earlier	 than	 Freud	 thought.	 They	 are
integrated	 in	 the	 fourth	 to	 the	 sixth	 years	 and
toned	down	and	consolidated	(depersonified	and
abstracted)	during	the	fifth	through	seventh	years.
The	 earliest	 superego	 structure	 is	 from	 “the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1270
internalization	 of	 fantastically	 hostile,	 highly
unrealistic	 object-images	 reflecting	 ‘expelled’,
projected,	 and	 reintrojected	 ‘bad’	 self-object
representations”	 (p.	 71).	 The	 stronger	 the
pregenital	
frustration	
and	
constitutional
aggression,	 the	 more	 predominant	 the	 sadistic
superego	forerunners;	the	sadistic	superego	peaks
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
the	
fourth	
stage	
of
development.
There	 is	 also	 a	 second	 primitive	 superego
structure—the	 condensed,	 ideal,	 “all	 good”	 self
and	object	representations	that	form	the	kernel	of
the	ego-ideal	through	primitive	idealization.
In	the	fourth	stage	of	development	these	two
aspects	 of	 the	 precursors	 of	 the	 superego	 are
“integrated,”	 leading	 to	 decreased	 defensive
projection	 and	 permitting	 the	 internalization	 of
more	 realistic	 demands	 and	 prohibitions	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1271
parents	during	the	oedipal	period.	Integration	and
internalization	 perform	 the	 function	 of	 toning
down	the	superego	from	primitive	and	archaic	to
more	 modulated	 and	 reasonable	 functioning.	 In
the	 fifth	 stage	 of	 development	 the	 toned-down
superego	
becomes	
more	
integrated	
and
harmonious	with	the	ego,	leading	to	consolidation
of	 ego	 identity,	 and	 the	 superego	 becomes	 more
abstract	and	depersonified.
In	 Kernberg’s	 theory	 two	 types	 of	 superego
failure	can	occur.	In	the	first	type,	there	is	a	failure
in	the	integration	of	the	sadistic	precursors	of	the
superego	with	the	benign	or	primitively	idealized
precursors,	
which	
interferes	
with	
the
internalization	 of	 more	 realistic	 oedipal	 parental
images	 and	 so	 perpetuates	 the	 primitive	 sadistic
superego	 forerunners	 and	 fosters	 excessive
reprojection,	leading	to	paranoia.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1272
In	 the	 second	 type,	 as	 in	 the	 borderline
personality,	 there	 is	 a	 similar	 type	 of	 failure	 of
integration	of	these	precursors	due	to	a	dangerous
primitive	idealization.	External	objects	are	seen	as
totally	 good	 in	 order	 to	 be	 sure	 they	 cannot	 be
destroyed	
by	
projected	
bad	
objects.	
This
phenomenon	occurs	too	early	and	in	too	extreme	a
fashion	as	a	result	of	the	need	to	defend	against	so
much	aggression.	Thus,	again,	idealization	is	seen
as	a	defense	against	aggression.	Furthermore,	the
internalization	 of	 primitively	 idealized	 early
object-images	 creates	 impossible	 internalized
demands,	 causing	 an	 impasse	 in	 which	 “a
catastrophic	 fusion”	 between	 these	 unrealistic
ideal	 objects	 and	 the	 “external	 persecutors,”	 or
projected	bad	objects,	then	forms.	This	leads	to	a
sadistic	 superego	 nucleus	 that	 is	 perpetuated	 by
reprojection	and	reintrojection.	This	also	leads	to
an	 interference	 with	 the	 toning	 down	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1273
superego	 by	 the	 internalization	 of	 more	 realistic
parental	prohibitions,	with	the	integration	of	the
superego	 itself,	 and	 with	 the	 development	 of
harmony	between	the	superego	and	the	ego.	The
latter	 causes	 interference	 with	 the	 formation	 of
ego	 identity,	 leading	 to	 the	 lack	 of	 a	 consistent
solid	integrated	self-concept,	one	of	the	important
DSM-III-R	characteristics	of	the	borderline	patient
(see	BORDERLINE).

SUBLIMATION
The	 concept	 of	 sublimation	 was	 originally
suggested	 by	 Rousseau	 and	 given	 importance	 by
Nietzsche,	 who	 actually	 named	 the	 process.
Nietzsche	 argued	 that	 passion,	 not	 reason,
controls	and	drives	humans,	but	he	always	added
that	sublimations	of	passion	is	best.	He	was	not	an
advocate	 of	 raw,	 crude	 passions,	 but	 he	 insisted
that	the	body	and	the	mind,	or	passion	and	reason,
are	 inseparable.	 Even	 conflict	 can	 be	 good,	 he
thought,	 because	 it	 generates	 growth	 (Nietzsche
1968).
In	 sublimation,	 as	 taken	 up	 by	 Freud	 (1915),
the	energy	of	an	unacceptable	impulse	is	diverted
and	 directed	 to	 socially	 acceptable	 means	 and
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1276
goals.	Freud	(1930)	thought	of	sublimation	as	an
extremely	important	mechanism	in	the	building	of
civilization.	 He	 claimed	 that	 artistic	 creation	 and
intellectual	curiosity,	which	may	have	no	apparent
connection	with	sexuality,	were	motivated	by	the
force	of	the	sexual	instinct	through	diversion	to	a
new	 nonsexual	 aim	 and	 socially	 valued	 objects.
Thus	 sublimation	 modifies	 an	 instinctual	 drive
according	 to	 the	 demands	 of	 society	 but	 still
allows	 some	 measure	 of	 gratification.	 It	 is	 an
unconscious	 ego	 function	 in	 which,	 unlike	 the
mechanisms	 of	 defense,	 the	 ego	 is	 not	 acting	 in
opposition	to	the	id	but	rather	is	helping	the	id	to
gain	gratification	in	the	external	world.	Therefore
sublimation	does	not	involve	repression,	although
the	original	impulse	is	not	conscious.
Sublimation	is	sometimes	thought	of	as	a	form
of	deaggressivization	or	desexualization;	this	was
the	 second	 way	 Freud	 tried	 to	 define	 it.	 Here,	 it
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1277
represents	a	theoretically	inferred	concept	rather
than	something	that	is	clinically	observable.	Anna
Freud	 (1946)	 viewed	 sublimation	 as	 a	 defense
because	 it	 provides	 a	 progressive	 solution	 of
infantile	 conflicts	 that	 might	 otherwise	 lead	 to
neurosis.
There	 is	 general	 agreement	 that	 a	 complete
theoretical	 understanding	 of	 sublimation	 has	 not
been	 developed	 in	 psychoanalytic	 literature	 and
that	 the	 concept	 remains	 somewhat	 shadowy.
Levey	 (1939)	 reviews	 the	 theory	 and	 points	 out
many	 unexplained	 loopholes	 and	 generalities.
There	is	a	certain	mystery	to	the	idea,	since	there
is	 no	 clear	 explanation	 of	 how	 sublimation	 takes
place	and	why	it	occurs	in	some	individuals	and	in
some	 forms	 rather	 than	 others.	 Loewald	 (1988)
attempts	 to	 present	 a	 traditional	 psychoanalytic
theory	 of	 sublimation.	 He	 warns	 us	 that
neutralization	is	not	the	same	as	sublimation	since
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1278
passion	 is	 not	 absent	 in	 sublimation.	 Without
sublimation,	 the	 transformation	 of	 the	 sexual
instinct,	 there	 would	 be	 no	 understanding	 in
metapsychological	 terms	 of	 the	 development	 of
civilization	as	Freud	conceived	of	it.	Sublimation	is
indispensable	 in	 human	 individual	 and	 collective
life.

(see	SCHIZOPHRENIA)
SUPEREGO
(see	also	EGO	IDEAL)
Freud	 (1914)	 proposed	 two	 psychic	 agencies
that	 function	 to	 preserve	 for	 the	 ego	 a	 sense	 of
self-esteem.	
The	
first	
agent,	
or	
ego-ideal,
represents	the	series	of	achievements	that,	when
reached,	 lead	 to	 a	 state	 of	 imagined	 infantile
perfection	
and	
narcissistic	
bliss.	
Freud
differentiated	 this	 agent	 from	 the	 agent	 that	 had
the	 function	 of	 observing	 the	 real	 achievements
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1280
and	 comparing	 them	 with	 the	 ideal	 standards.
Later	 he	 (1916)	 considered	 this	 self-criticizing
faculty	to	be	the	same	as	the	dream	censor	and	as
belonging	to	the	ego,	not	the	superego.	In	the	next
step,	 Freud	 (1921)	 began	 to	 separate	 the
“conscience”	 and	 ego-ideal	 from	 the	 ego.	 He
conceived	 of	 the	 possibility	 of	 the	 ego-ideal-
conscience	as	coming	into	conflict	with	the	rest	of
the	 ego,	 and	 even	 raging	 with	 a	 critical	 cruelty
against	the	ego.	The	extent	of	this	cruelty,	which
can	
function	
unconsciously,	
was	
a	
major
motivation	 for	 his	 (1923)	 development	 and
presentation	of	the	structural	theory,	in	which	the
psychic	apparatus	is	a	tripartite	model	containing
the	id,	superego,	and	ego.
Freud	 considered	 the	 development	 of	 the
superego	 primarily	 as	 a	 consequence	 of	 the
resolution	of	the	Oedipus	complex.	He	increasingly
emphasized	the	punitive	and	cruel	aspects	of	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1281
superego	rather	than	its	benign,	loving	aspect.	He
(1926)	thought	of	the	threat	from	the	superego	as
an	 extension	 of	 the	 castration	 threat.	 He	 (1933)
came	 to	 view	 the	 superego	 as	 an	 internalized
parental	 authority	 dominating	 the	 ego	 through
punishment	and	threats	of	withdrawal	of	love.
The	 apparent	 paradox	 of	 the	 sometimes
clinically	
observed	
contrast	
between	
the
harshness	of	the	superego	imitation	of	the	parents
and	the	actual	kindness	of	the	parents	in	real	life
was	explained	as	the	borrowing	by	the	superego	of
the	child’s	own	hostility	to	the	prohibiting	parents.
Thus	the	superego	is	always	thought	of	as	having	a
direct	 connection	 to	 the	 id	 and	 is	 able	 to	 drain
aggression	from	the	id	by	turning	it	upon	the	ego.
Recent	 work	 has	 focused	 much	 more	 on	 the
preoedipal	aspects	of	superego	development	(see
also	 OBJECT	 RELATIONS	 THEORY	 and	 SADISM).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1282
An	outstanding	example	of	this	is	in	the	work	of
Kernberg	(see	SPLITTING).	A	considerable	aspect
of	 the	 superego	 is	 unconscious.	 The	 heir	 of	 the
Oedipus	 complex,	 as	 Freud	 conceived	 of	 it,	 the
superego	 functions	 mainly	 unconsciously	 to
approve	 or	 disapprove,	 to	 critically	 self-observe,
to	 bring	 about	 self-punishment,	 to	 bring	 about
reparation	 for	 perceived	 wrongdoing,	 and	 to
establish	 or	 reduce	 self-esteem.	 See	 KLEIN	 for
details	 of	 her	 views	 on	 the	 development	 of	 the
superego,	 which	 are	 quite	 different	 from	 Freud’s
conception.

TERMINATION
There	 is	 little	 agreement	 on	 the	 subject	 of
termination	in	psychoanalysis	or	in	psychoanalytic
therapy.	Drawing	on	data	from	the	Psychotherapy
Research	 Project	 at	 the	 Menninger	 Clinic,	 Ticho
(1972)	attempted	to	formulate	a	reasonable	set	of
indications	 for	 the	 inception	 of	 the	 termination
phase	of	the	treatment.	These	include	such	issues
as	 whether	 the	 transference	 neurosis	 has	 been
reduced,	 attenuation	 of	 the	 patient’s	 symptoms
and	 character	 pathology	 to	 the	 point	 where
functioning	 is	 not	 impaired,	 a	 sense	 that	 the
patient’s	 treatment	 goals	 have	 been	 reached,	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1285
movement	in	the	direction	of	equality	between	the
analyst	 and	 the	 patient	 (including	 the	 patient’s
capacity	 to	 perceive	 the	 analyst	 more	 or	 less
realistically),	 analysis	 of	 the	 patient’s	 separation
anxieties,	infantile	expectations,	and	so	forth,	with
a	 consequent	 improvement	 in	 the	 patient’s	 ego
capacities,	 and	 an	 assessment	 of	 the	 residual
transference	and	the	patient’s	future	capacities.
In	 general,	 when	 the	 therapist	 feels	 that
termination	is	at	hand	on	the	basis	of	his	or	her
assessment	 of	 these	 items,	 or	 on	 the	 basis	 of
material	 from	 the	 patient	 indicating	 that	 the
patient	is	at	some	level	contemplating	termination,
the	therapist	often	has	to	articulate	this	readiness
and	 present	 it	 for	 discussion.	 When	 there	 is
mutual	agreement	that	termination	is	at	hand,	it	is
wise	 to	 set	 a	 termination	 date	 proper.	 Once	 the
date	is	set	it	is	not	wise	to	change	it	because	this
can	lead	to	a	number	of	complications.

Firestein	(1978)	devotes	a	book	to	a	study	of
case	 histories	 of	 termination	 followed	 by	 a
summary	 of	 his	 viewpoint	 and	 a	 review	 of	 the
literature.	 He	 believes	 that	 there	 is	 a	 specific
termination	 phase	 characterized	 by	 many	 affects
such	as	separation	anxiety,	grief,	and	rage.	During
this	 phase	 there	 is	 no	 particular	 change	 in	 the
therapeutic	 alliance	 but	 certain	 communication
becomes	 more	 blunt.	 He	 feels	 that	 in	 instances
where	 there	 is	 too	 much	 gratification	 in	 the
analysis	 or	 too	 many	 defensive	 anxieties	 and
hostilities	 against	 the	 termination	 idea,	 it	 is	 very
important	for	the	analyst	to	introduce	the	subject
of	termination.	One	can	check	on	how	the	patient
experiences	
the	
analyst’s	
vacations	
as	
an
indication	 of	 how	 termination	 will	 go.	 Firestein
concedes	 that	 the	 subject	 of	 termination	 is
sometimes	 brought	 up	 as	 an	 intuitive	 maneuver.
Attempts	
to	
“wean”	
the	
patient	
represent
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1287
countertransference	
and	
not	
psychoanalytic
therapy.	 The	 analyst	 should	 not	 change	 the
frequency	 of	 the	 sessions	 or	 his	 or	 her	 style,	 or
attempt	 to	 develop	 a	 friendship,	 nor	 should	 the
patient	 sit	 up	 because	 these	 countertransference
maneuvers	 may	 interfere	 with	 the	 postanalytic
working-through	 process	 phase	 that	 follows
termination.
Loewald	 (1988)	 regards	 mourning	 as	 the
crucial	aspect	of	the	termination	phase.	In	order	to
assess	 whether	 there	 are	 reasonable	 grounds	 or
pathological	 motives	 behind	 a	 patient’s	 wish	 to
terminate,	 he	 suggests	 we	 examine	 whether
termination	 is	 brought	 up	 during	 a	 hostile	 or
friendly	 phase	 of	 the	 treatment,	 whether	 it
constitutes	a	testing	of	the	therapist’s	“love,”	how
it	is	related	to	behavior	of	the	therapist	(such	as
the	 therapist’s	 detachment	 from	 the	 patient	 for
one	 reason	 or	 another),	 and	 whether	 themes	 of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1288
separation	 or	 loss	 followed	 by	 reunion	 are
becoming	 manifest	 in	 the	 patient’s	 material.	 He
writes,	 “Most	 often	 the	 motives	 for	 the	 patient’s
inclination	to	terminate	are	mixed,	and	frequently
it	 is	 no	 easy	 task	 for	 the	 therapist	 to	 assess	 the
balance	 of	 forces.	 I	 would	 include	 here	 also	 the
therapist’s	 realistic	 appraisal	 of	 the	 weight	 of
external	factors	that	may	favor	or	seem	to	compel
termination”	 (p.	 158).	 Loewald	 concludes,	 and	 I
agree,	 that	 it	 is	 the	 therapist’s	 responsibility	 as
well	as	a	measure	of	the	therapist’s	competence,	to
make	 an	 objective	 assessment	 of	 the	 balance	 of
motives	
in	
order	
to	
reach	
agreement	
or
disagreement	with	the	patient	about	termination
although,	of	course,	the	final	decision	is	always	up
to	the	patient.
In	 my	 clinical	 experience,	 I	 feel	 that	 the
seriousness	of	bringing	up	the	issue	of	termination
to	 a	 patient	 has	 not	 been	 sufficiently	 stressed	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1289
the	 literature.	 I	 have	 treated	 some	 cases	 where
therapists	have,	either	out	of	incompetence	or	out
of	countertransference	problems,	raised	the	issue
of	termination	prematurely,	with	the	consequence
of	 suicidal	 acting	 out	 by	 the	 patient.	 In	 general,
readiness	for	termination	usually	suggests	itself	in
a	
well-conducted	
psychotherapy	
or
psychoanalysis	and,	with	careful	self-analysis,	the
therapist	 usually	 only	 needs	 to	 be	 a	 minor	 step
ahead	 of	 the	 patient’s	 material	 to	 recognize	 that
the	patient	is	ready	for	the	termination	phase.	If
this	material	does	not	appear	at	a	time	when	the
therapist	feels	it	ought	to	be	showing	itself,	it	is	an
occasion	not	for	confrontation	with	the	patient	or
a	 demand	 for	 termination,	 but	 rather	 for	 the
therapist	to	consult	with	a	colleague.
I	am	also	on	the	side	of	those	who	believe	that
the	analytic	work	should	continue	to	the	very	last
day	 and	 that	 the	 relationship	 should	 remain
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1290
professional	to	the	very	end.	This	leaves	the	door
open	 for	 the	 patient	 to	 return	 if	 problems	 arise
later	and	to	resume	treatment	without	having	to
deal	 with	 the	 contamination	 emanating	 from	 the
therapist’s	
countertransference.	
This
countertransference	 typically	 consists	 of	 anxiety
over	separation	from	the	patient	or	mourning	over
the	loss	of	the	relationship	and	can	show	itself	in
some	very	peculiar	ways.	Some	of	these	that	I	have
encountered	are:	giving	the	patient	a	farewell	kiss,
developing	a	personal	friendship	with	the	patient
after	 the	 treatment,	 contacting	 the	 patient	 after
termination	 for	 a	 variety	 of	 rationalizations,
inquiring	 about	 subsequent	 activities	 of	 the
patient	 from	 friends	 or	 acquaintances	 (of	 either
the	 therapist	 or	 patient),	 and	 so	 forth.	 Both
assessing	 the	 patient’s	 readiness	 for	 termination
and	dealing	with	the	termination	phase	up	to	the
last	minute	of	the	treatment	are	important	pitfalls

THERAPEUTIC	ALLIANCE,
WORKING	ALLIANCE
Freud	 (1912)	 spoke	 of	 an	 “unobjectionable
positive	
transference”	
as	
the	
basis	
for	
a
therapeutic	or	working	alliance	to	develop.	There
is	 considerable	 debate	 in	 the	 literature	 as	 to
whether	 the	 so-called	 real	 relationship,	 or
therapeutic	or	working	alliance,	is	different	from
the	 unobjectionable	 positive	 transference.	 These
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1293
are	 ambiguous	 and	 controversial	 ideas	 and	 have
generated	 debate	 that	 currently	 is	 not	 resolved
(Gill	1982).
The	therapeutic	alliance	is	thought	of	as	a	real
and	mature	alliance	with	the	conscious	adult	ego
of	 the	 patient,	 encouraging	 the	 patient	 to	 be	 a
scientific	partner	in	the	exploration	of	his	or	her
difficulties.	This	can	be	extended	to	overlap	with
the	 whole	 concept	 of	 after-education,	 essentially
thought	 of	 as	 correcting	 the	 blunders	 of	 the
parents	(Freud	1940).
For	 those	 who	 differentiate	 it	 from	 the
unobjectionable	 positive	 transference,	 a	 working
alliance	 is	 mandatory	 for	 any	 therapy	 to	 be
successful.	The	concept	of	a	working	alliance	was
introduced	 by	 Zetzel	 (1956)	 and	 brought	 to	 the
attention	 of	 the	 psychiatric	 community	 by
Greenson	
(1965).	
Very	
often	
the	
key	
to
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1294
understanding	 therapeutic	 stalemate	 is	 found	 in
the	 failure	 of	 the	 patient	 to	 develop	 a	 reliable
working	 relationship	 with	 the	 psychotherapist.
This	 working	 relationship	 depends	 both	 on	 the
patient	and	on	the	therapist.	No	matter	what	the
patient	is	like,	if	the	therapist	does	not	meet	the
requirements	 of	 maturity,	 a	 sound	 working
alliance	cannot	develop	and	the	therapy	is	doomed
from	the	beginning.
The	 patient	 also	 makes	 a	 contribution:	 he	 or
she	 must	 have	 the	 capacity	 to	 form	 a	 working
alliance.	The	best	definition	of	a	working	alliance
is	 that	 it	 is	 an	 alliance	 between	 the	 patient’s
reasonable	 or	 conscious	 or	 mature	 ego	 and	 the
therapist’s	working	or	therapeutic	or	analytic	ego.
What	makes	this	possible,	claims	Greenson,	is	the
patient’s	partial	identification	with	the	therapist’s
approach	as	he	or	she	attempts	to	understand	the
patient’s	behavior.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1295
In	 simpler	 terminology,	 if	 the	 therapist	 is
genuinely	interested	in	the	patient	and	genuinely
concerned	with	understanding	the	patient,	and	if
the	 patient	 has	 the	 ego	 capacity	 to	 develop	 a
working	alliance,	then	the	patient	will	develop	and
exercise	 one	 of	 the	 unique	 functions	 of	 a	 human
being—the	capacity	to	stand	off	and	observe	one’s
self.	The	patient	will	take	on	the	therapist’s	stance
of	nonanxious	investigation.	Hopefully,	the	patient
will	also	identify	with	the	therapist’s	tolerance.
It	 is	 possible	 to	 train	 the	 patient’s	 ego	 in	 the
therapy	to	the	point	where	a	working	alliance	can
be	 formed,	 maintained,	 and	 improved.	 This	 is
sometimes	 called	 preparation	 for	 psychotherapy,
and	 is	 done	 by	 consistently	 focusing	 on	 the
alliance	 in	 such	 a	 way	 as	 to	 reinforce	 those	 ego
functions	 in	 the	 patient	 that	 contribute	 to	 the
alliance	 and	 by	 attempting	 to	 stimulate	 the
necessary	 ego	 functions	 that	 are	 inadequate.	 A
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1296
mutual	concern	with	the	working	alliance	tends	to
enhance	it.	It	is	extremely	difficult	to	separate	the
conditions	 of	 the	 working	 alliance	 from	 the
conditions	of	the	transference,	and	it	is	not	even
clear	 whether	 it	 is	 useful	 to	 attempt	 such	 a
separation.

TOPOGRAPHIC	THEORY
There	 are	 two	 major	 metapsychological
theories	introduced	by	Freud.	Chapter	7	of	Freud’s
The	Interpretation	of	Dreams	(1900)	and	his	paper
“The	Unconscious”	(1915)	offer	the	basic	concepts
of	 the	 topographic	 theory.	 The	 structural	 theory,
involving	 the	 psychic	 agencies	 ego,	 id,	 and
superego	 (see	 EGO,	 ID	 and	 SUPEREGO)	 was
introduced	by	Freud	in	1923.
The	early	form	of	the	topographic	theory	may
be	described	as	follows:
1. The	mind	is	made	up	of	two	parts:	the	system
unconscious	 (Ucs.),	 or	 the	 infantile	 part,
and	the	system	preconscious	(Pcs.),	or	the
adult	part.
2. The	system	unconscious	contains	wishes	and
seeks	 to	 reexperience	 the	 sensations	 of
previous	gratifications.
3. The	 unpleasure	 principle	 (later	 called	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1298
pleasure	 principle	 by	 Freud)	 governs	 the
system	 unconscious.	 According	 to	 the
pleasure	 principle,	 accumulated	 mental
energy	 must	 be	 discharged	 as	 quickly	 as
possible	 to	 bring	 the	 system	 back	 to	 the
previous	
resting	
state.	
The	
system
preconscious	is	guided	by	what	Freud	later
called	the	reality	principle.
4.	The	system	unconscious	is	oblivious	to	reality
and	 operates	 essentially	 by	 condensation
and	 displacement	 of	 mental	 energies;
mutually	 contradictory	 tendencies	 can
exist	side	by	side.
5.	 Mental	 energies	 are	 freely	 mobile	 in	 the
system	unconscious.
6.	 There	 is	 a	 dynamic	 interplay	 between	 the
unconscious	
and	
the	
preconscious,
introducing	the	thorny	metapsychological
problem	of	repression	(see	REPRESSION)
as	 a	 major	 concept.	 The	 failure	 of	 the
preconscious	 to	 have	 ever	 cathected	 a
certain	 unconscious	 wish	 is	 called	 primal
repression.	 This	 store	 of	 infantile	 wishes,
“which	 has	 from	 the	 first	 been	 held	 back
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1299
from	 the	 Pcs.,	 becomes	 a	 sine	 qua	 non	 of
repression”	(Freud	1900,	p.	604).
If	a	preconscious	wish	or	idea	becomes
associated	 with	 or	 cathected	 by	 an
unacceptable	
unconscious	
wish,	
the
preconscious	 cathexis	 will	 be	 withdrawn,
in	
accordance	
with	
the	
unpleasure
principle.	This	withdrawal	of	cathexis	from
a	 preconscious	 idea	 is	 called	 repression
proper.	 As	 Freud	 conceived	 it,	 a	 strong
instinctual	 drive	 associated	 with	 the
repudiated	 idea	 may	 still	 try	 to	 force	 its
way	to	the	conscious,	even	if	it	has	lost	its
cathexis	from	the	Pcs.	There	then	follows	a
defensive	 struggle,	 for	 the	 Pcs.	 in	 turn
reinforces	its	opposition	to	the	repressed
thoughts	 (i.e.,	 produces	 an	 anticathexis).
The	 result	 may	 be	 the	 appearance	 of	 a
compromise	 formation	 in	 the	 conscious.
Notice	 that	 primal	 repression	 leads	 to	 a
pulling	 of	 associated	 ideas	 into	 the
unconscious;	 repression	 proper	 is	 a
pushing	out	of	the	system	preconscious.
7.	The	topographic	theory	is	to	be	thought	of	as
a	functional,	not	a	spatial	theory.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1300
8.	Consciousness	is	like	an	eye,	a	sense	organ	for
the	 perception	 of	 external	 or	 internal
qualities.
The	 famous	 diagrams	 in	 chapter	 7	 of	 The
Interpretation	 of	 Dreams	 are	 worthy	 of	 careful
study.	The	notion	of	psychotherapy	as	a	vehicle	to
bring	the	unconscious	under	the	domination	of	the
preconscious	 is	 presented	 first;	 the	 critical
distinction	 between	 primary	 and	 secondary
process	is	then	established:
The	 primary	 processes	 are	 present	 in	 the
mental	 apparatus	 from	 the	 first,	 while	 it	 is
only	 during	 the	 course	 of	 life	 that	 the
secondary	 processes	 unfold,	 and	 come	 to
inhibit	and	overlay	the	primary	ones;	it	may
even	 be	 that	 their	 complete	 domination	 is
not	 attained	 until	 the	 prime	 of	 life.	 In
consequence	 of	 the	 belated	 appearance	 of
the	 secondary	 processes,	 the	 core	 of	 our
being,	 consisting	 of	 unconscious	 wishful
impulses,	
remains	
inaccessible	
to	
the
understanding	
and	
inhibition	
of	
the
preconscious;	the	part	played	by	the	latter	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1301
restricted	once	and	for	all	to	directing	along
the	 most	 expedient	 paths	 the	 wishful
impulses	 that	 arise	 from	 the	 unconscious.
These	
unconscious	
wishes	
exercise	
a
compelling	 force	 upon	 all	 later	 mental
trends,	 a	 force	 which	 those	 trends	 are
obliged	 to	 fall	 in	 with	 or	 which	 they	 may
perhaps	 endeavor	 to	 divert	 and	 direct	 to
higher	aims.	[pp.	603-604]
From	 this	 it	 appears	 that	 the	 system
unconscious	 plays	 the	 same	 role	 for	 Freud	 as
noumena	 did	 for	 Kant.	 Indeed,	 Freud	 continues,
“The	 unconscious	 is	 the	 true	 psychical	 reality;	 in
its	innermost	nature	it	is	as	much	unknown	to	us
as	 the	 reality	 of	 the	 external	 world,	 and	 it	 is	 as
incompletely	
presented	
by	
the	
data	
of
consciousness	 as	 is	 the	 external	 world	 by	 the
communications	of	our	sense	organs”	(p.	613).	In
this	 chapter	 of	 The	 Interpretation	 of	 Dreams	 the
whole	notion	of	psychodynamic	psychiatry	and	its
underlying	
philosophy	
is	
set	
down—the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1302
symptoms	 of	 mental	 illness	 are	 explained	 on	 a
dynamic	basis,	as	a	result	of	the	strengthening	and
weakening	 of	 the	 various	 components	 in	 the
interplay	of	inner	forces,	so	many	of	whose	effects
are	hidden	from	view	even	while	ordinary	mental
functions	are	apparently	normal.
It	 should	 be	 noted	 that	 all	 the	 concepts	 of
metapsychology	 have	 come	 under	 recent	 attack
even	 from	 within	 the	 psychoanalytic	 community
itself.	In	Freud’s	shift	from	the	topographic	theory
to	the	structural	theory,	certain	aspects	of	clinical
material	 were	 insufficiently	 reinterpreted	 at	 the
time	 in	 the	 light	 of	 the	 newer	 metapsychology,
leaving	an	inconsistency	in	the	formulation	of	the
theory	of	mental	functioning.	Arlow	and	Brenner
(1964)	give	a	complete	review	of	the	topographic
and	structural	theories	and	attempt	to	resolve	the
inconsistencies.

TRANSFERENCE,
TRANSFERENCE	NEUROSIS
The	crucial	concept	of	transference	has	a	long
history	and	there	are	innumerable	articles	on	the
subject;	 a	 detailed	 review	 of	 the	 background	 of
this	 concept	 is	 presented	 by	 Orr	 (1954).	 The
customary	 definition	 of	 transference	 is	 given	 by
Fenichel	 (1945):	 “In	 the	 transference	 the	 patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1304
misunderstands	the	present	in	terms	of	the	past;
and	 then	 instead	 of	 remembering	 the	 past,	 he
strives,	 without	 recognizing	 the	 nature	 of	 his
action,	 to	 relive	 the	 past	 and	 to	 live	 it	 more
satisfactorily	 than	 he	 did	 in	 his	 childhood.	 He
‘transfers’	the	past	attitude	to	the	present”	(p.	29).
Transference	is	a	form	of	resistance	in	which
patients	defend	themselves	against	remembering
and	discussing	their	infantile	conflicts	by	reliving
them.	 It	 offers	 a	 vital	 and	 unique	 clinical
opportunity	to	observe	and	experience	derivatives
of	 the	 past	 directly	 and	 thereby	 to	 better
understand	 the	 development	 of	 the	 nuclear
childhood	conflicts.	Wetzler	(1985)	points	out	that
“in	 current	 practice	 transference	 analysis	 and
reconstructive	 work	 go	 hand-in-hand,”	 and	 that
transference	 “offers	 the	 patient	 a	 sense	 of
conviction	that	the	narrative	is	about	his	 life”	 (p.
190).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1305
Arlow	(1985)	views	the	analyst’s	behavior	as	a
stimulus,	 as	 a	 day	 residue,	 but	 it	 is	 through	 the
stimulation	 of	 the	 patient’s	 unconscious	 fantasy
life	that	the	reaction	we	call	transference	occurs.
Even	 in	 the	 transference,	 at	 least	 at	 first,	 we	 see
only	 derivatives	 of	 the	 persistent	 unconscious
fantasy	 activity	 of	 childhood	 that	 governs	 the
individual’s	life.	At	the	core	of	every	patient	there
resides	a	crucial	fantasy	activity,	interwoven	with
early	 infantile	 experiences	 to	 a	 greater	 or	 lesser
degree,	 depending	 on	 how	 traumatic	 these
experiences	have	been.	But	Arlow	(1985)	explains,
“What	 constitutes	 trauma	 is	 not	 inherent	 in	 the
actual,	 real	 event,	 but	 rather	 the	 individual’s
response	
to	
the	
disorganizing,	
disruptive
combination	of	impulses	and	fears	integrated	into
a	 set	 of	 unconscious	 fantasies”	 (p.	 533).	 Certain
object	relations	and	self	psychology	theories	tend
to	 minimize	 the	 role	 of	 this	 unconscious	 fantasy
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1306
activity	 and	 emphasize	 the	 pathogenic	 effect	 of
real	 events	 and	 interactions.	 But	 the	 individual’s
experience,	 explains	 Arlow	 (1980),	 “is	 usually
organized	in	terms	of	a	few,	leading,	unconscious
phantasies	
which	
dominate	
an	
individual’s
perception	of	the	world	and	create	the	mental	set
by	 which	 she	 or	 he	 perceives	 and	 interprets
her/his	experience”	(p.	131).	Transference	is	not	a
repetition	of	the	patient’s	actual	early	interactions
with	present	objects,	but	expresses	derivatives	of
the	 patient’s	 persistent	 unconscious	 childhood
fantasies,	 the	 “psychic	 reality”	 of	 these	 early
interactions	for	the	patient	(see	FANTASY).
Greenson	 (1967)	 points	 out	 that	 the	 term
“transference”	 itself	 may	 be	 misleading.	 It	 is	 a
singular	 noun,	 but	 transference	 phenomena	 are
plural,	multiple,	and	diversified.	Greenson	lists	five
important	characteristics	denoting	a	transference
reaction.	 The	 outstanding	 trait	 that	 overrides	 all
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1307
others	 and	 is	 included	 in	 all	 the	 others	 is
inappropriateness:	 “It	 is	 inappropriateness,	 in
terms	of	intensity,	ambivalence,	capriciousness,	or
tenacity	 which	 signals	 that	 the	 transference	 is	 at
work”	(1967,	p.	162).
A	 transference	 can	 appear	 in	 many	 kinds	 of
interpersonal	situations	and	play	a	very	important
role.	 In	 psychotherapy	 we	 usually	 speak	 of	 a
positive	 or	 negative	 transference.	 A	 positive
transference	
implies	
reactions	
composed
predominantly	of	love	in	any	of	its	forms	or	in	any
of	 its	 forerunners	 or	 derivatives	 (see	 LOVE).
Greenson	(1967)	writes:	“We	consider	a	positive
transference	 to	 exist	 when	 the	 patient	 feels
towards	 his	 analyst	 any	 of	 the	 following:	 Love,
fondness,	 trust,	 amorousness,	 liking,	 concern,
devotion,	admiration,	infatuation,	passion,	hunger,
yearning,	tenderness,	or	respect”	(p.	225).
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1308
In	the	process	of	intensive	psychotherapy	we
often	do	not	worry	as	much	about	the	appearance
of	 positive	 transference	 as	 we	 do	 about	 the
appearance	of	negative	transference.	In	a	negative
transference	 we	 observe	 a	 series	 of	 reactions
based	on	the	various	forms	of	hate.	According	to
Greenson	 (1967),	 “Negative	 transference	 may	 be
expressed	 as	 hatred,	 anger,	 hostility,	 mistrust,
abhorrence,	
aversion,	
loathing,	
resentment,
bitterness,	 envy,	 dislike,	 contempt	 or	 annoyance,
etc.”	 (p.	 233).	 It	 is	 always	 present,	 although	 it	 is
perhaps	surprisingly	often	much	more	difficult	to
uncover	
negative	
transference	
than	
the
manifestations	of	positive	transference.	There	are
many	 possible	 reasons	 for	 this	 clinical	 fact.	 The
two	 most	 obvious	 are	 that	 patients	 don’t	 like	 to
become	aware	of	transference	hate	and	to	express
it	 and	 that	 therapists	 don’t	 particularly	 enjoy
being	the	object	of	transference	hate	and	to	have
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1309
to	deal	with	it	or	be	exposed	to	it.
As	a	general	rule	of	thumb,	one	may	say	that
for	an	uncovering	psychotherapy	to	be	successful,
there	will	have	to	be	sharp	manifestations	of	both
positive	 and	 negative	 transference.	 To	 put	 it
another	 way,	 therapists	 must	 be	 prepared	 to	 be
exposed	 to	 powerful	 negative	 and	 positive
emotional	feelings	coming	from	patients,	often	on
a	 highly	 irrational	 basis.	 This	 exposure	 to	 such
powerful	 feelings	 can	 lead	 to	 many	 mistakes,
retreats,	 and	 confusions	 in	 psychotherapy,	 if
therapists	 are	 not	 expecting	 them	 to	 appear,	 are
not	 prepared	 to	 deal	 with	 them,	 or	 are	 so
primarily	 preoccupied	 with	 their	 own	 needs	 and
problems	that	they	cannot	perceive	clearly	what	is
going	 on.	 There	 is	 an	 all-too-human	 tendency	 in
psychotherapy	to	deflect	emerging	manifestations
of	 powerful	 erotic	 or	 negative	 transferences	 by
various	 forms	 of	 interventions,	 resulting	 in	 a
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1310
collusion	
(Langs	
1979)	
to	
avoid	
these
uncomfortable	emotions.	It	is	the	responsibility	of
the	therapist	not	to	allow	this	to	occur.
“Transference	 neurosis”	 was	 Freud’s	 (1914)
term	 for	 a	 clinical	 psychoanalytic	 situation	 in
which	 the	 patient	 developed	 such	 intense
transference	 feelings	 to	 the	 therapist	 that
everything	else	in	his	or	her	life	became	of	lesser
importance.	 The	 classical	 conception	 of	 the
transference	 neurosis	 has	 it	 that	 the	 infantile
feelings	 and	 conflicts	 of	 the	 patient	 are	 focused
almost	
exclusively	
on	
the	
analyst.	
The
transference	 neurosis	 could	 also	 be	 thought	 of
more	 generally	 as	 an	 extremely	 important—or
even	 the	 patient’s	 temporarily	 most	 important—
object	relationship,	the	affectual	nature	of	which	is
determined	
predominantly	
by	
the	
patient’s
projection	 of	 repressed	 split-off	 self	 and	 object
representations.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1311
The	concept	of	transference	neurosis	has	run
into	difficulty	because	very	often,	even	in	a	formal
psychoanalysis,	the	classical	transference	neurosis
simply	 does	 not	 appear.	 One	 sees	 a	 great	 many
varieties	 of	 transference	 phenomena,	 but	 a	 focal,
sharply	 defined	 transference	 neurosis	 cannot
always	be	expected	to	take	place.	The	reasons	for
this	failure	of	transference	neurosis	formation	are
a	 matter	 of	 considerable	 debate,	 but	 it	 is	 not
always	just	the	result	of	poor	technique.	Because
of	 this,	 many	 contemporary	 authorities,	 such	 as
Brenner	 (see	 Kligerman’s	 discussion	 in	 Pollock
and	 Gedo,	 1984),	 would	 like	 to	 eliminate	 the
concept.
An	 issue	 of	 the	 Journal	 of	 the	 American
Psychoanalytic	Association	(Calef	1971)	is	devoted
almost	entirely	to	the	subject	of	the	transference
neurosis.	 At	 least	 certain	 basic	 premises	 can	 be
agreed	upon:
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1312
1.	 The	 transference	 neurosis	 revives	 the
infantile	neurosis.
2.	It	is	created	out	of	the	frustrated	demands
for	love	that,	in	turn,	arise	out	of	the	therapeutic
situation	as	we	structure	it.
3.	The	symptoms	of	the	transference	neurosis
are	 dynamic,	 shifting,	 and	 changing;	 it	 is	 not	 a
static	concept.
4.	 Important	 in	 the	 development	 of	 the
transference	 neurosis	 are	 the	 mechanisms	 of
regression	
and	
repetition—indeed,	
the
transference	neurosis	can	be	thought	of	as	arising
out	of	the	repetition	compulsion.
5.	 In	 the	 transference	 neurosis,	 the	 old
symptoms	 of	 the	 adult	 neurosis	 that	 the	 patient
has	 come	 to	 complain	 about	 lose	 their	 libidinal
force	 and	 seem	 to	 be	 much	 improved,	 for	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1313
patient	is	preoccupied	with	the	transference.
6.	The	transference	neurosis	is	not	identical	to
and	does	not	describe	in	a	one-to-one	manner	the
nature	of	the	infantile	relationships	that	have	been
transferred.	 There	 is	 a	 process	 of	 layering	 of
subsequent	meanings	on	to	infantile	relationships
and	 events	 that	 reflects	 current	 interests	 and
conflicts.	 These	 layers	 coalesce	 into	 meaningful
transference	patterns.
7.	 Eventually,	 the	 transference	 neurosis	 itself
becomes	 involved	 in	 a	 resistance	 to	 treatment.
This	 is	 known	 as	 transference	 resistance	 (Gill
1982),	 a	 resistance	 to	 the	 resolution	 of	 the
transference	as	manifested,	for	example,	by	refusal
to	 see	 determinants	 in	 it	 from	 the	 past	 or	 by	 a
demand	 for	 gratification	 of	 the	 transference
wishes.	 If	 the	 therapist	 breaks	 Freud’s	 rule	 of
abstinence	and	provides	such	gratification,	further
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1314
insight	 becomes	 impossible	 and	 a	 stalemate
usually	results,	with	an	interminable	therapy.
The	management	of	the	transference	neurosis,
according	to	classical	psychoanalysis,	permits	the
undoing	of	repression	and	is	the	central	issue	of
treatment.	 The	 concept	 of	 interpretation	 as
primarily	 functioning	 to	 resolve	 the	 transference
neurosis	differentiates	psychoanalysis	from	other
forms	of	treatment.	It	is	important	to	clarify	this
issue	 a	 little	 more.	 According	 to	 classical
psychoanalysis,	a	full-blown	transference	neurosis
develops	 in	 an	 orderly	 and	 manageable	 fashion.
This	 is	 then	 interpreted,	 and	 such	 interpretation
permits	an	undoing	of	the	transference	neurosis,
which,	in	turn,	frees	the	patient	from	the	nuclear
infantile	 conflicts	 by	 allowing	 the	 adult	 ego	 to
resolve	them	in	new	ways.	It	is	the	preoccupation
with	the	transference	neurosis	that	differentiates
psychoanalysis	from	other	forms	of	treatment;	the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1315
special	efficacy	of	psychoanalysis	is	believed	to	be
in	 the	 removal	 of	 the	 transference	 neurosis
through	 interpretation,	 rather	 than	 through	 any
other	 aspects	 of	 the	 treatment.	 The	 most	 recent
thinking	on	the	transference	neurosis	is	in	a	panel
reported	by	Shaw	(1991).
The	transference	neurosis	may	also	appear	in
psychotherapy.	It	is	not	necessary	for	a	patient	to
come	in	four	or	five	times	a	week	and	lie	on	the
couch	 for	 a	 transference	 neurosis	 to	 appear.	 On
the	other	hand,	it	is	much	more	likely	that,	if	the
transference	 neurosis	 is	 going	 to	 appear,	 it	 will
appear	
under	
the	
conditions	
of	
formal
psychoanalysis.	But	it	is	very	important	for	anyone
doing	intensive	psychotherapy	to	understand	the
concept	 of	 the	 transference	 neurosis	 and	 to	 be
aware	 of	 its	 appearance,	 if	 it	 does	 appear	 in	 the
psychotherapy.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1316
A	transference	neurosis	can	arise	in	situations
wherein	the	patient	has	a	very	weak	ego	state	and
poor	 defenses.	 In	 such	 situations	 the	 patient
cannot	 actually	 utilize	 the	 transference	 neurosis
toward	 the	 working	 through	 of	 intrapsychic
problems.	 If	 a	 profound	 transference	 neurosis
seems	 to	 be	 developing	 in	 a	 psychotherapy,	 the
therapist	must	be	careful	to	ascertain	the	ego	state
of	 the	 patient	 and	 to	 determine	 by	 the	 use	 of
interpretation	 whether	 the	 patient	 is	 actually
capable	 of	 utilizing	 the	 developing	 transference
neurosis.	 If	 the	 patient	 cannot	 utilize	 it,	 efforts
should	 be	 made	 to	 break	 up	 the	 transference
neurosis	 by	 decreasing	 the	 frequency	 of	 the
treatment,	 by	 active	 interpretation	 and	 support,
and	so	on.
It	is	often	diagnostic	of	borderline	patients	that
they	develop	highly	negative	or	strongly	eroticized
transferences	 very	 early,	 even	 in	 a	 once-a-week
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1317
psychotherapy	(see	BORDERLINE).	These	must	be
resolved	 by	 prompt	 interpretation,	 today	 usually
based	 on	 Kernberg’s	 (1975)	 modified	 Kleinian
concepts	of	projected	split-off	all	bad	or	all	good
self	 and	 object	 representations	 (see	 SPLITTING).
Or,	 if	 self	 psychology	 is	 utilized,	 transferences
powerfully	 infused	 with	 lust	 and	 aggression
appearing	 early	 and	 suddenly	 in	 therapy	 are
analyzed	
as	
manifestations	
of	
profound
disappointment	 in	 the	 patient’s	 expectations	 of
empathy	
from	
the	
subjectively	
perceived
selfobject	
analyst.	
Failure	
to	
resolve	
such
disruptive	 transference	 typically	 destroys	 the
therapy.	As	Blum	(1973)	points	out,	for	example,
the	 incorrect	 response	 to	 a	 highly	 eroticized
transference	 can	 deadlock	 the	 treatment	 in	 an
unconscious	conspiracy	of	mutual	admiration	and
endearment.
A	 transference	 psychosis	 sometimes	 appears.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1318
This	 is	 always	 a	 very	 undesirable	 situation	 that
resembles	 the	 strong	 transference	 neurosis,	 but
the	 patient	 has	 absolutely	 no	 insight	 into	 it	 and
denies	completely	that	the	phenomena	he	or	she	is
experiencing	
are	
transference	
at	
all.	
Such
situations	 as	 falling	 desperately	 in	 love	 with	 the
therapist	 can	 be	 understood	 as	 a	 transference
psychosis	if	this	tremendous	falling	in	love	refuses
to	yield	to	any	kind	of	interpretation;	the	patient
insists	that	the	love	is	genuine	and	based	on	the
marvelous	qualities	of	the	therapist,	and	definitely
refuses	 to	 see	 any	 transference	 phenomena
involved	in	it.	Clinical	judgment	is	required	here	to
distinguish	
between	
an	
object-instinctual
transference	 that	 has	 exploded	 without	 insight
and	
Kohut’s	
(1971)	
narcissistic	
“idealizing
transference.”	The	latter	contains	a	more	eerie	and
vague	 form	 of	 idealizing	 of	 the	 therapist,	 and
interpretations	 are	 met	 with	 rage	 because	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1319
patient	needs	such	a	transference	and	experiences
the	 therapist’s	 attempts	 to	 break	 it	 up	 by
interpretation	as	a	severely	disappointing	failure
of	
empathy	
and	
understanding	
(see	
SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).
The	 transference	 often	 becomes	 a	 part	 of	 the
patient’s	resistance	maneuvers	in	a	further	effort
to	 avoid	 undoing	 the	 forces	 of	 repression.	 This
leads	 to	 terminological	 confusion	 because	 all
transference	 can	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 a	 form	 of
resistance	to	remembering.	The	difference	is	that
transference	as	a	resistance	maneuver	arises	more
specifically	in	certain	situations	in	psychotherapy
that	call	it	forth	and	then	functions	as	a	resistance
to	 further	 psychotherapy.	 An	 example	 would	 be
the	patient’s	sudden	demand	for	gratification	and
refusal	to	concentrate	on	anything	else.
In	 a	 transference	 defense,	 or	 “defensive
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1320
transference	 reaction”	 (Greenson	 1967),	 just	 as
the	 patient	 would	 be	 expected	 to	 arrive	 at	 a
certain	 insight	 out	 of	 the	 material	 that	 is	 being
presented,	 there	 suddenly	 appears	 instead	 a
powerful	 transference	 reaction,	 most	 typically	 a
negative	transference.	The	sudden	and	sometimes
dramatic	 appearance	 of	 strong	 transference
manifestations	at	a	sharp	point	in	a	psychotherapy
session	gives	rise	to	the	possibility	that	the	patient
is	 using	 the	 transference	 to	 defend	 against
feelings,	memories,	or	emerging	insight	that	must
be	denied	at	the	time.	The	therapist	also	must	be
vigilant	and	constantly	aware	of	the	appearance	of
transference	
manifestations	
that	
can	
show
themselves	either	in	small	or	subliminal	ways,	as
well	as	in	dramatic	explosions.
Some	 authors	 (Schlessinger	 and	 Robbins
1974)	 use	 the	 term	 “defense	 transference”	 as	 a
transference	 that	 forms	 to	 defend	
against
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1321
awareness	
of	
a	
deeper,	
more	
important
transference.	
They	
write,	
“It	
is	
the
characterological	 defensive	 organization,	 evident
at	the	onset	of	an	analysis,	which	serves	as	a	shield
against	the	transference	neurosis,	and	as	a	major
coping	 mechanism	 of	 the	 ego	 in	 the	 face	 of
conflict”	 (pp.	 547-548).	 For	 example,	 a	 highly
idealized	 transference	 commonly	 develops	 as	 a
defense	 against	 the	 awareness	 of	 a	 hidden
negative	
transference.	
Here	
one	
form	
of
transference	 is	 habitually	 used	 to	 defend	 the
patient	 from	 the	 emergence	 of	 another	 more
intense	 and	 upsetting	 transference—or	 even	 of
the	transference	neurosis—into	awareness,	and	so
the	 defense	 transference	 serves	 the	 function	 of
tension	regulation	(Schlessinger	1984).
Other	 authors	 (Greenson	 1967)	 refer	 more
specifically	to	character	transference	phenomena.
These	 character	 transference	 phenomena	 can	 be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1322
thought	of	as	hidden	in	the	patient’s	more	general
behavior	
patterns.	
The	
term	
is	
somewhat
misleading	and	confusing,	but	what	distinguishes
this	 form	 of	 transference	 from	 others	 is	 that	 the
reaction	 to	 the	 therapist	 is	 part	 of	 the	 patient’s
habitual,	representative,	and	typical	responses	to
people	 at	 large,	 and	 the	 transference	 behavior	 is
characteristic	 of	 the	 patient’s	 relationships	 in
general.	 It	 is	 this	 quality	 of	 the	 nonspecific
behavior	 that	 has	 led	 to	 the	 term	 “character
transference.”	 The	 important	 point	 is	 that	 the
patient	may	be	reacting	to	the	therapist	with	his	or
her	habitual	reactions	to	a	different	kind	of	person
than	 the	 therapist	 actually	 is.	 This	 is	 what	 the
therapist	 has	 to	 be	 aware	 of	 in	 watching	 for
character	transference	phenomena.
Much	 recent	 work	 has	 been	 presented	 in	 the
literature	 on	 the	 so-called	 archaic	 transferences
(Gedo	 1977,	 Gunther	 1984)	 (see	 ARCHAIC
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1323
TRANSFERENCES),	 stimulated	 by	 the	 work	 of
Kohut	 (1971,	 1977,	 1978).	 Kohut	 describes	 the
well-known	 mirror	 and	 idealizing	 transferences
found	in	narcissistic	personality	disorders,	which
are	 not	 transferences	 in	 the	 technical	 sense
because	 they	 do	 not	 involve	 instinctual	 wishes
that	cross	the	repression	barrier.	They	are	instead
a	 demand	 for	 a	 “selfobject”	 in	 order	 to	 fill	 in
intrapsychic	defects	and	allow,	in	the	treatment,	a
resumption	 of	 development	 from	 the	 preoedipal
narcissistic	
stages	
(for	
details,	
see	
SELF
PSYCHOLOGY).	
More	
generally,	
the	
archaic
transference	is	marked	in	preoedipal	disorders	by
an	 intense	 and	 overt	 demand	 for	 gratification,
making	 the	 psychotherapist	 feel	 almost	 like	 a
prisoner	 and	 forced	 away	 from	 the	 analytic
analyzing	 attitude.	 Refusal	 to	 comply	 is	 often
followed	 by	 seriously	 disruptive	 rage	 and	 chaos.
Certain	 authors	 (Gunther	 1984)	 feel	 that	 some
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1324
gratification	 is	 necessary,	 but	 should	 always	 be
followed	 by	 interpretation.	 This	 remains	 a
controversial	 technical	 area.	 Adler	 (1980)	 points
out	 that	 the	 hallmark	 of	 the	 borderline	 patient’s
transference	 is	 the	 rapid	 disintegration	 of	 the
selfobject	 transference	 as	 soon	 as	 gratification	 is
not	forthcoming,	and	recommends	the	use	of	one’s
best	 judgment	 about	 how	 much	 deprivation	 is
tolerable	 in	 such	 situations.	 Therefore	 the
instability	 of	 the	 transference	 is	 an	 important
hallmark	of	an	archaic	transference,	and	it	poses
extremely	difficult	problems	for	the	therapist.
Kleinian	therapists	(Spillius	1983)	characterize
this	 as	 projective	 identification	 (see	 PROJECTIVE
IDENTIFICATION)	in	the	transference,	marked	by
interpersonal	pressure	placed	on	the	therapist	to
do	 something,	 which,	 of	 course,	 represents	 an
obstruction	 to	 understanding.	 But	 Greenson
(1974)	 complains	 that	 the	 Kleinians	 emphasize
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1325
this	 concept	 of	 projective	 identification	 in	 the
transference	 in	 all	 cases,	 blurring	 the	 distinction
between	
neurotic,	
narcissistic,	
and	
archaic
transferences.	 The	 identification	 and	 handling	 of
archaic	 transferences	 becomes	 a	 specialized
aspect	 of	 intensive	 psychotherapy,	 requiring	 the
willingness	 to	 work	 with	 very	 primitive	 and
disruptive	patients.
An	 especially	 central	 role	 involving	 the
transference	
in	
both	
psychoanalysis	
and
psychotherapy	is	presented	by	Gill	(1982,	1984).
Gill	 is	 especially	 concerned	 with	 the	 therapist’s
here-and-now	behavior	as	profoundly	influencing
the	 transference	 that	 develops,	 so	 for	 him
transference	 is	 the	 result	 of	 the	 interaction
between	the	patient	and	analyst	and	is	therefore
always	 present.	 It	 may	 be	 most	 commonly
manifested	 by	 allusions	 to	 it	 in	 dreams	 and
associations,	and	the	therapist	must	continuously
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1326
look	for	it,	clarify	the	contribution	of	the	analytic
situation	to	it,	interpret	the	patient’s	resistances	to
awareness	of	it,	and	finally	translate	the	disguised
and	 displaced	 expressions	 of	 it	 into	 direct
experience	 and	 discussion.	 In	 such	 resolution	 of
the	 transference,	 Gill	 emphasizes	 the	 corrective
emotional	 experience	 that	 is	 involved,	 since	 by
such	 a	 procedure	 the	 analyst	 behaves	 quite
differently	 from	 what	 the	 patient	 has	 come	 to
expect	and	even	provokes	from	others.	The	most
controversial	 premise	 of	 Gill’s	 view	 is	 the
assumption	of	the	centrality	of	the	transference	in
all	material.
The	 therapist	 must	 be	 aware	 of	 the	 serious
danger	 of	 the	 acting	 out	 of	 the	 transference
outside	the	therapist’s	office.	So	all	reports	by	the
patient	 of	 interactions	 outside	 therapy,	 even
dreams	 containing	 such	 interactions,	 must	 be
closely	 examined	 for	 veiled	 allusions	 to	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1327
transference.
The	 most	 serious	 flaws	 in	 the	 handling	 of
transference	 reactions	 are	 from	 the	 subtle,
chronic,	 unrecognized	 ones	 that	 go	 on	 for	 years
without	being	detected.	These	flaws	usually	stem
from	 two	 main	 sources:	 countertransference
reactions	 and	 incorrect	 understanding	 of	 the
patient	
for	
reasons	
other	
than
countertransference.
One	of	the	most	common	causes	of	stalemate
or	 failure	 in	 psychotherapy	 is	 the	 lack	 of
awareness	 on	 the	 part	 of	 the	 therapist	 to	 the
manifestations	of	transference.	This	is	often	due	to
the	 therapist’s	 own	 lack	 of	 proper	 training
psychoanalysis	or	ongoing	self-analysis.

TRANSIENCE
The	 eleventh-century	 Persian	 poet	 Omar
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1331
Khayyam	 (1941)	 in	 the	 latter	 half	 of	 the	 11th
century	wrote	(p.	52,	p.	155),
.	.	.	One	thing	is	certain,	that	Life	flies;
One	thing	is	certain	and	the	Rest	is	Lies;
The	flower	that	once	has	blown	forever	dies.
Whether	at	Naishapur	or	Babylon,
Whether	the	Cup	with	sweet	or	bitter	run,
The	Wine	of	Life	keeps	oozing	drop	by	drop,
The	Leaves	of	Life	keep	falling	one	by	one.
I	have	included	this	item	in	the	dictionary	for
two	 reasons.	 In	 the	 first	 place,	 Freud	 wrote	 a
beautiful	paper	on	the	subject	in	November	1915,
about	a	year	after	the	outbreak	of	the	First	World
War.	This	essay	shows	him	as	a	man	of	letters	at
the	 height	 of	 his	 powers,	 and	 stands	 with	 any
collection	 of	 the	 great	 essays	 of	 the	 Western
world.	It	also	shows	that	in	1915,	in	spite	of	the
war,	 he	 was	 not	 a	 pessimistic	 man.	 The	 essay
demonstrates	 a	 lifelong	 capacity	 in	 Freud	 to
appreciate	what	is	available	to	appreciate	in	spite
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1332
of	the	gloom	and	difficulties	of	his	situation.
The	other	reason	for	including	this	item	is	that
patients	 often	 complain	 of	 the	 “transience”	 of
human	 life,	 even	 of	 its	 finest	 moments	 of
enjoyment	 and	 beauty.	 As	 Freud	 (1915)	 points
out,	it	is	typical	of	young	melancholy	poets	to	give
voice	to	this	kind	of	complaint.	It	is	also	typical	of
patients	 who	 are	 depressed,	 lonely,	 or	 feeling
alienated	or	isolated	to	dwell	on	the	transience	of
everything	in	human	life.	In	our	psychotherapeutic
work	we	do	not	respond	the	way	Freud	did	to	the
young	 poet	 in	 the	 essay.	 His	 response	 was	 on	 a
summer	walk	with	the	young	and	famous	poet	and
“a	 taciturn	 friend”	 (p.	 305),	 who	 has	 never	 been
identified.	 On	 such	 summer	 walks	 Freud’s
beautiful	
response	
is	
appropriate,	
but	
in
psychotherapeutic	work	we	listen	to	this	material
but	attempt	to	link	it,	as	Freud	does,	to	a	sense	of
depression	 or	 mourning.	 Freud	 interprets	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1333
concern	 over	 transience	 as	 an	 attempt	 to	 escape
the	 necessity	 of	 mourning	 over	 the	 decease	 of
beautiful	 or	 enjoyable	 times	 because	 the	 mind
“instinctively	recoils	from	anything	that	is	painful”
(p.	306).	In	my	clinical	experience,	these	concerns
about	transience	have	more	to	do	with	what	Bion
(1967)	 has	 called	 attacks	 an	 linking.	 These
patients	 cannot	 allow	 themselves	 to	 become
deeply	 committed	 in	 any	 enduring	 fashion	 to
anything	 or	 anybody,	 because	 they	 are	 afraid	 of
their	own	needs	and	afraid	to	be	vulnerable	to	loss
or	narcissistic	wounding.
It	is	the	task	of	psychotherapeutic	work	to	do
with	 the	 developmentally	 damaged	 individual
what	Freud	hopes	for	after	World	War	I:	“We	shall
build	 up	 again	 all	 that	 war	 has	 destroyed,	 and
perhaps	on	firmer	ground	and	more	lastingly	than
before”	(p.	307).

TRANSMUTING	INTERNALIZATION
(see	SELF	PSYCHOLOGY)
TWO	PRINCIPLES	OF	MENTAL	FUNCTIONING
“Formulations	on	the	Two	Principles	of	Mental
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1335
Functioning”	(Freud	1911)	has	become	one	of	the
classics	 of	 psychoanalysis	 even	 though	 it	 is
extremely	 difficult,	 condensed,	 and	 was	 badly
received	 when	 first	 presented.	 It	 represents	 a
turning	 point	 in	 Freud’s	 interests	 and	 begins	 a
series	of	papers	on	metapsychology,	which	in	turn
were	conceived	as	the	first	part	of	a	book	on	the
subject	that	was	later	abandoned.
The	 basic	 point	 of	 it	 is	 to	 introduce	 the
distinction	between	the	pleasure	principle,	which
dominates	 the	 primary	 processes	 of	 mental	 life,
and	 the	 reality	 principle,	 which	 dominates
secondary	process	thought.	Primary	processes	are
unconscious	mental	processes	striving,	under	the
domination	 of	 the	 pleasure	 principle,	 for	 the
realization	 of	 wishes	 and	 a	 yield	 of	 pleasure	 as
well	as	to	avoid	unpleasure;	with	the	introduction
of	 the	 reality	 principle,	 which	 occurs	 gradually,
fantasy	and	daydream	are	split	off	and	conscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1336
thought	 guides	 the	 person	 to	 strive	 for	 what	 is
useful	 and	 to	 guard	 against	 the	 imagination.
Repression	or	flight	is,	to	some	extent,	replaced	by
judgment	and	sublimation.
This	setting	up	of	the	reality	principle	leads	to
some	basic	changes	in	the	psychic	apparatus.	The
perceptual	apparatus	must	be	expanded	in	order
to	be	aware	of	external	as	well	as	internal	states,
and	 the	 sense	 organs	 become	 more	 directed
toward	
the	
external	
world.	
Consciousness
becomes	 more	 interested	 in	 sensory	 qualities	 in
addition	 to	 the	 qualities	 of	 pleasure	 and
unpleasure,	 “which	 hitherto	 had	 been	 alone	 of
interest	to	it”	(p.	220).
A	 special	 function	 is	 instituted	 to	 search	 the
external	world;	the	activity	of	this	function	meets
the	sense	impressions	halfway	instead	of	awaiting
their	 appearance.	 This	 searching	 function	 is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1337
defined	as	a	“tension”	by	Freud.	At	the	same	time,
a	system	of	“notation”	is	introduced	to	lay	down
the	
results	
of	
this	
periodical	
activity	
of
consciousness,	part	of	what	Freud	calls	“memory.”
Ideas	 leading	 to	 pain	 and	 which	 therefore	 have
previously	 been	 shut	 out	 by	 repression	 are	 now
subjected	to	judgment.	In	this	paper,	drawing	back
from	 pain	 and	 shutting	 out	 reality	 is	 defined	 as
repression,	 which	 may	 confuse	 the	 reader;	 some
authors	 suggest	 the	 word	 “disavowal”	 as	 more
suitable	for	this	function.
Motor	discharge,	which	was	initially	under	the
pleasure	principle	for	the	purpose	of	unburdening
the	mental	apparatus	of	accretions	of	stimuli,	now
shifts	 under	 the	 reality	 principle	 to	 action	 in
changing	the	environment.	Restraint	upon	action
or	 motor	 discharge	 becomes	 necessary	 and	 is
provided	 by	 means	 of	 the	 process	 of	 thinking,
which	is	defined	here	as	“an	experimental	kind	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1338
acting,	accompanied	by	displacement	of	relatively
small	 quantities	 of	 cathexis	 together	 with	 less
expenditure	 (discharge)	 of	 them”	 (p.	 221).	 Thus
thought	 makes	 it	 possible	 for	 the	 mental
apparatus	to	support	an	increase	in	tension	with
the	 delay	 of	 discharge,	 and	 thought	 becomes	 an
experimental	way	of	acting.
The	 ego	 permits	 small	 quanta	 of	 primary
process	energy	to	pass	through;	such	quanta	are
then	 transformed	 by	 the	 ego	 into	 secondary
process	 energy,	 using	 memory,	 and	 are	 more	 in
tune	 with	 reality.	 This	 is	 Freud’s	 conception	 of
thought—the	change	of	unbound	primary	process
energy	
into	
secondary	
process	
energy—an
experimental	 way	 of	 acting	 with	 comparison	 to
memory	 and	 the	 modification	 and	 synthesis	 into
secondary	process.
The	 clinical	 point	 of	 this	 discussion	 is	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1339
explanation	of	pathological	thought,	which	occurs
when	 the	 instinct	 itself	 is	 discharged	 in	 thought.
Thus	 obsessional	 thought	 is	 a	 discharge,	 but	 a
regressive	one,	and	the	instinct	is	not	discharged
through	 the	 motor	 apparatus	 as	 instincts	 should
be,	 but	 rather	 in	 a	 substituted	 discharge	 of
rumination	or	obsessional	thinking.
The	 reality	 principle	 governs	 the	 process	 of
thought,	which	contains	judgment—in	which	there
is	 a	 comparison	 of	 external	 reality	 with	 the
conceivably	successful	memory	traces,	and	finally
a	 form	 of	 trial	 action	 as	 described	 above—an
experimental	way	of	acting	using	small	amounts	of
energy.	 This	 process	 also	 makes	 the	 original
impulse	 easier	 to	 deal	 with,	 since	 some	 of	 its
energy	has	been	borrowed	and	discharged	in	the
thought	process.	Under	this	theory,	such	thinking
as	that	employed	in	pure	mathematics,	which	does
not	have	action	as	its	end	result,	would	have	to	be
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1340
defined	 as	 regressive.	 If	 a	 serious	 block	 of
discharging	energy	in	the	operation	of	the	motor
apparatus	is	erected	by	the	superego,	then	all	the
energy	 is	 dammed	 up,	 floods	 backwards,	 and
hypercathects	 the	 thought	 systems,	 leading	 to	 a
drainage	 through	 obsessive	 rumination	 (Freud
1909).

TWO-WOMAN	PHENOMENON
Weiss	 (1987)	 published	 an	 important	 clinical
paper	describing	what	he	named	“the	two-woman
phenomenon.”	 A	 man	 who	 shows	 this	 syndrome
retains	 his	 commitment	 to	 his	 wife	 but	 is	 also
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1341
passionately	 in	 love	 with	 another	 woman	 (see
LOVE).	 He	 appears	 in	 the	 clinician’s	 office	 only
when	 a	 conflict	 occurs	 because	 one	 or	 the	 other
woman	must	be	given	up	due	to	the	vicissitudes	of
life.	Such	a	patient	usually	got	married	early	in	life
to	a	woman	from	a	background	similar	to	his	own.
The	 new	 woman	 is	 usually	 from	 a	 different
background	 and	 her	 age	 is	 not	 of	 obvious
significance.	 This	 is	 not	 the	 same	 man	 who
divorces	his	wife	in	mid-life	and	begins	over	with	a
younger	woman	(see	MID-LIFE	CRISIS);	rather,	he
is	 devoted	 and	 conscientious.	 Reciprocally,	 the
wife	 is	 depicted	 as	 a	 devoted	 and	 conscientious
woman	 who	 takes	 good	 care	 of	 the	 home	 and
children.	 Unfortunately,	 she	 does	 not	 stimulate
passion	 or	 excitement	 in	 the	 man.	 He	 in	 turn
indulges	in	sex	with	his	wife	infrequently	and	out
of	 duty.	 In	 fact,	 it	 is	 often	 reported	 that	 sexual
relations	occur	mainly	because	the	man	does	not
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1342
wish	 his	 wife	 to	 become	 suspicious	 that	 he	 has
another	woman.	The	man	believes,	often	correctly,
that	his	wife	is	not	interested	in	his	work,	except
possibly	for	the	money	and	prestige	that	it	brings
to	her.
Weiss	 adds	 that	 the	 man	 is	 not	 promiscuous
and	sets	high	standards	of	functioning	for	himself
and	 others.	 When	 the	 man	 considers	 having	 to
give	up	the	other	woman,	he	speaks	sadly	of	life
“returning,	once	again,	to	the	colorless,	dull,	daily
routine,	devoid	of	any	pleasure”	(p.	274),	usually
accompanied	by	a	profound	fear	that	his	creative
functioning	will	also	be	lost.
These	relationships	involving	two	women	can
go	 on	 for	 a	 long	 time.	 The	 crisis	 occurs	 when	 a
decision	 must	 be	 made,	 in	 which	 the	 individual
must	choose	between	his	terrible	guilt	involved	in
deserting	 a	 devoted,	 conscientious	 wife	 of	 long
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1343
standing	on	the	one	hand,	and	the	terrible	despair
involved	in	losing	a	woman	who	has	enhanced	his
creative	 functioning	 and	 brought	 excitement	 and
happiness	into	his	life,	on	the	other.	An	additional
factor	 in	 coercing	 the	 man	 to	 give	 up	 the	 other
woman,	if	he	is	forced	to	decide,	is	the	fear	of	this
usually	
successful	
individual	
that	
he	
will
otherwise	 be	 shunned	 by	 his	 colleagues	 and	 his
career	 will	 be	 ruined.	 Such	 an	 individual	 often
views	 or	 imagines	 his	 wife	 as	 powerful	 and
destructive	 and	 believes	 that	 the	 new	 woman	 is
devoted	 to	 enhancing	 his	 masculinity,	 autonomy,
pleasure,	and	creativity.
A	cardinal	psychodynamic	agent	in	these	cases
is	a	primitive	superego	that	wants	to	extinguish	all
sexual	 pleasure,	 aggression,	 and	 autonomy,	 and
demands	a	central	emphasis	on	self-sacrifice	and
hard	work	for	never-ending	success.	This	leads	to
an	intense	unconscious	conflict	between	powerful
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1344
id	 wishes	 for	 instinctual	 gratification	 and	 the
prohibition	by	the	superego	with	its	never-ending
demands	for	more	and	more	performance.	Weiss
explains	 the	 two-woman	 phenomenon	 as	 a
compromise	formation.	At	home	the	man	remains
true	 to	 his	 superego	 requirements	 but	 with	 a
smoldering	 anger	 toward	 his	 wife;	 outside	 the
home	he	experiences	success	and	pleasure	but	at
the	same	time	a	fear	of	devastating	punishment	if
he	commits	himself	to	the	new	woman.
Patients	
who	
present	
this	
two-woman
phenomenon	 do	 not	 fall	 into	 any	 one	 diagnostic
category.	A	considerable	degree	of	psychodynamic
variation	 was	 manifest	 in	 the	 cases	 that	 Weiss
investigated,	
from	
those	
with	
significant
preoedipal	pathology	and	an	archaic	superego	to
others	in	which	the	two-woman	phenomenon	is	an
analyzable	 defensive	 style.	 There	 is	 such	 a
complicated	mixture	of	preoedipal	pathology	often
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1345
present	in	these	patients,	Weiss	explains,	that	they
present	difficulties	in	evaluating	analyzability	and
treatment	strategy.
I	 (Chessick	 1989)	 have	 suggested	 that	 what
has	 occurred	 is	 a	 gradual	 accumulation	 of	 anger,
which	tends	to	peak	in	middle	age	as	the	needs	of
such	 men	 are	 sharply	 enhanced	 by	 the	 self-
depletion	problems	of	middle	age.	The	wife	is	not
hated	 or	 regarded	 as	 all	 bad.	 She	 is	 appreciated
and	 loved,	 in	 a	 way.	 She	 does	 not	 stimulate
passion	
anymore	
because	
of	
the	
man’s
accumulating	 anger	 that	 she	 cannot	 and	 will	 not
function	as	a	nursing	mother,	an	archaic	selfobject
(see	 SELFOBJECT)—which	 he	 regressively	 needs
more	 and	 more	 as	 he	 grows	 older	 and	 more
depleted.	The	perception	of	the	wife	as	powerful
or	 destructive	 is	 a	 projection	 of	 the	 man’s	 own
anger	 and	 vulnerability	 in	 needing	 her,	 not	 a
projection	 of	 an	 “all	 bad”	 archaic	 maternal
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1346
representation.	When	the	man	returns	to	his	wife
he	 does	 not	 return	 to	 a	 hated	 object	 but	 to	 an
empty,	colorless,	dull,	daily	routine,	a	reflection	of
his	 empty,	 depleted	 self.	 He	 feels	 regressively
weak	and	passive	in	her	presence	and,	in	Weiss’s
report,	even	thinks	of	suicide	or	death	as	the	way
out.	 This	 is	 the	 picture	 of	 a	 disappointed,	 deeply
humiliated,	 narcissistic	 person	 who	 has	 a	 dim
awareness	 of	 his	 increasing	 neediness	 and	 his
increasing	 desire	 for	 support,	 mirroring,	 and
empathy	as	he	ages.
Weiss’s	notion	that	the	maternal	image	is	split
into	a	good	and	bad	image	as	a	defense	against	the
Oedipus	 complex	 does	 not	 seem	 to	 fit	 the	 actual
development	of	the	two-woman	phenomenon	as	I
have	observed	it	clinically.	I	think	it	is	an	escape
from	 the	 superego	 and	 from	 a	 depression	 that
intensifies	as	narcissistic	goals	are	not	reached	in
middle	age	and	the	individual	rages	at	himself	for
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1347
his	failures	and	suffers	from	an	empty	depletion.
The	 two-woman	 phenomenon	 represents	 a
reaching	 out	 again,	 a	 regressive	 reidealization	 of
an	 external	 figure	 to	 make	 amends	 for	 the
depletion	 in	 failing	 to	 attain	 unreachable	 ego-
ideals,	 and	 then	 a	 reassuring	 erotic	 fusion	 with
this	 idealized	 person,	 which	 restores	 narcissistic
equilibrium.
The	 clinically	 observable	 split	 is	 between	 an
idealized	woman	on	the	one	hand,	and	a	sought	for
wife-mother	on	the	other,	who	is	feared	but	who	is
still	 viewed	 as	 good.	 Escape	 from	 the	 rigid
superego	 and	 its	 threats	 of	 punishment	 and
unbearable	humiliation	for	failing	in	middle	age	to
live	up	to	youthful	and	romantic	narcissistic	ideals,
in	 my	 clinical	 experience,	 is	 the	 central	 issue.
Suicide	is	another	such	escape.
With	the	new	woman	there	is	the	pleasure	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1348
uncomplicated	 orgasm	 with	 which	 nothing	 can
compare	because	it	is	unambivalent	as	far	as	the
idealization	 is	 concerned;	 there	 is	 no	 smoldering
anger	 to	 interfere	 with	 libidinal	 arousal.	 For	 the
wife	there	is	a	sense	of	duty	and	a	felt	requirement
to	 deliver	 an	 orgasm	 to	 her,	 which	 dilutes	 the
man’s	sexual	pleasure	by	increasing	his	rage,	since
this	 duty	 is	 not	 consistent	 with	 his	 unconscious
demand	that	she	function	as	an	archaic	selfobject
—always	 giving	 and	 always	 present,	 with	 no
needs	 of	 her	 own.	 The	 other	 woman	 wishes	 to
please	the	man	and	gives	narcissistic	gratification,
whereas	 the	 wife	 sets	 adult	 requirements,	 has
demands,	and	makes	often	realistic	criticism.
The	 man	 is	 healthy	 enough	 not	 to	 commit
himself	completely	to	the	other	woman	because	he
knows	at	some	level	that	if	he	did,	eventually	the
idealization	of	her	would	suffer	the	same	fate	that
his	 idealization	 of	 his	 wife	 has	 suffered,	 and	 he
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1349
would	not	end	up	in	a	better	situation	than	he	is
already	 in.	 The	 bilateral	 arrangement,	 while	 it	 is
stable,	 functions	 well	 as	 a	 compromise.	 It	 allows
the	man	to	receive	the	mirroring	that	he	needs	and
to	 enjoy	 the	 illusion	 of	 archaic	 selfobject
functioning	 from	 the	 other	 woman,	 while	 at	 the
same	 time	 obtaining	 the	 needed	 maternal
devotion	of	a	conscientious	wife	who	makes	him	a
reasonable	home.	That	is	why	such	patients	come
into	 treatment	 only	 when	 they	 have	 to	 choose
between	
one	
or	
the	
other	
woman.	
They
desperately	need	both.

UNCONSCIOUS
There	 is	 considerable	 confusion	 about	 the
concept	 of	 the	 unconscious,	 a	 notion	 that	 has	 a
long	 history	 before	 Freud.	 Authors	 such	 as
Nietzsche	 and	 Schopenhauer	 used	 this	 concept;
Ellenberger	(1970)	produced	a	complete	scholarly
discussion	of	the	unconscious	as	it	evolved	or	was
“discovered.”
Freud	used	the	term	“unconscious”	either	as	an
adjective	or	as	a	realm	in	the	topographic	theory
(see	
TOPOGRAPHIC	
THEORY).	
The	
special
characteristics	of	the	unconscious	as	a	realm	are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1351
discussed	 in	 Freud’s	 (1915)	 essay	 on	 the
unconscious,	section	5.	These	are:
1.	 The	 unconscious	 is	 made	 up	 of	 ideational
representatives	of	the	instincts,	which	are
exempt	 from	 mutual	 contradiction.	 Thus
there	is	no	negation	in	the	unconscious.
2.	Thought	processes	in	the	unconscious	behave
according	 to	 primary	 process.	 That	 is	 to
say,	one	idea	may	surrender	to	another	all
its	 cathexis	 (the	 motility	 of	 cathexis),	 a
process	known	as	displacement.	One	idea
may	 appropriate	 the	 whole	 cathexis	 of
several	 ideas,	 a	 process	 known	
as
condensation.
3.	 The	 unconscious	 has	 no	 conception	 of	 time.
Ideas	
and	
impulses	
from	
different
chronological	
ages	
are	
telescoped
together,	and	only	the	present	exists.
4.	The	unconscious	has	no	sense	of	outer-world
reality.	 A	 sense	 of	 psychical	 reality
replaces	 our	 sense	 of	 external	 reality	 so
that	a	wish	for	something	is	equated	with
the	 actual	 happening.	 Thus	 unconscious
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1352
processes	 are	 subject	 merely	 to	 the
pleasure	 principle	 (see	 TWO	 PRINCIPLES
OF	 MENTAL	 FUNCTIONING)	 and	 operate
according	
to	
displacement	
and
condensation,	 which	 are	 the	 laws	 of
primary	process	thought.
The	unconscious	as	a	realm	allegedly	contains
inherited	mental	formations,	as	well	as	what	has
been	discarded	in	childhood	in	the	process	of	ego
formation.	Jung	(Campbell	1977)	emphasized	the
archaic	or	collective	aspect	of	the	unconscious,	but
Freud	did	not.	The	unconscious	as	a	noun	refers	to
a	dynamic	system	in	the	topographic	theory,	and
the	 unconscious	 as	 an	 adjective	 refers	 to	 mental
content	not	available	to	the	conscious	mind	even
with	 prolonged	 concentration.	 If	 prolonged
concentration	does	bring	material	to	the	conscious
mind,	we	define	this	material	as	having	existed	in
the	 preconscious.	 The	 tendency	 today	 is	 to	 use
“unconscious”	more	as	an	adjective,	in	describing
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1353
not	only	the	id	of	the	structural	theory	(see	ID)	but
also	important	aspects	of	the	ego	and	superego.

WILD	PSYCHOANALYSIS
(see	also	PSYCHOANALYSIS)
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1354
Wild	 psychoanalysis	 was	 first	 described	 by
Freud	(1910).	In	Freud’s	case	vignette,	a	middle-
aged	 lady	 has	 been	 told	 by	 her	 doctor	 that	 the
cause	of	her	anxiety	is	lack	of	sexual	satisfaction
and	 has	 been	 advised	 to	 either	 return	 to	 her
husband	(whom	she	had	recently	divorced),	take	a
lover,	 or	 masturbate.	 Freud	 begins	 with	 the
important	 clinical	 caution	 that	 one	 should	 not
accept	 as	 true	 what	 patients	 report	 that	 their
physicians	have	said	or	done	to	them.	Physicians,
especially	 psychiatrists,	 easily	 become	 the	 target
of	 their	 patient’s	 hostile	 feelings	 and	 often
become,	by	projection,	responsible	in	the	patient’s
mind	 for	 the	 patient’s	 own	 repressed	 wishes.
Whether	or	not	the	doctor	in	Freud’s	case	vignette
actually	 gave	 his	 patient	 such	 poor	 advice,	 the
scientific	errors	in	misunderstanding	the	meaning
of	 sexual	 life	 and	 in	 the	 notion	 that	 sexual
abstinence	
produces	
mental	
disorders	
are
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1355
obvious.	 As	 Freud	 explains,	 “If	 knowledge	 about
the	unconscious	were	as	important	for	the	patient
as	
people	
inexperienced	
in	
psychoanalysis
imagine,	 listening	 to	 lectures	 or	 reading	 books
would	 be	 enough	 to	 cure	 him.	 Such	 measures,
however,	 have	 as	 much	 influence	 on	 nervous
illness	as	a	distribution	of	menu-cards	in	a	time	of
famine	
has	
upon	
hunger”	
(p.	
225).	
Wild
interpretations	or	attempts	to	rush	the	patient	by
brusquely	
telling	
him	
or	
her	
about	
the
unconscious	 not	 only	 do	 not	 work,	 they	 usually
inspire	 the	 patient’s	 hearty	 enmity	 and	 may
eliminate	 any	 further	 influence	 by	 the	 physician.
Freud	 also	 points	 out	 that	 one	 may	 be	 wrong	 in
such	 early	 surmises,	 and	 that	 one	 is	 never	 in	 a
position	to	discover	the	whole	truth.
In	
certain	
situations	
the	
patient	
may
wholeheartedly	 accept	 early	 and	 premature
interpretations	 as	 a	 way	 of	 sidetracking	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1356
therapist	 and	 avoiding	 any	 depth	 understanding.
One	variant	of	this	is	in	the	training	candidate	who
eagerly	accepts	every	interpretation	of	his	or	her
training	 analyst	 in	 the	 secret	 hope	 of	 getting
through	 the	 analysis	 and	 graduating	 from	 the
institute	as	quickly	as	possible	(see	REVERSIBLE
PERSPECTIVE).
It	 is	 not	 possible	 for	 any	 psychotherapist	 or
psychoanalyst	 to	 practice	 anything	 but	 wild
psychoanalysis	if	the	therapist	has	not	received	a
thorough	 personal	 psychoanalysis	 of	 his	 or	 her
own.	 Otherwise	 the	 therapist’s	 “insights”	 and
“interpretations”	 will	 be	 unconsciously	 aimed	 at
reducing	 the	 anxiety	 of	 the	 therapist	 in	 the
psychoanalytic	situation.	One	of	the	most	frequent
causes	 of	 wild	 analysis	 lies	 in	 unresolved
narcissistic	 problems	 in	 the	 therapist,	 who
attempts	 to	 dazzle	 the	 patient	 with	 his	 or	 her
remarkable	knowledge	of	the	unconscious.	This	is
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1357
a	form	of	exhibitionism.
An	argument	exists	as	to	whether	the	early	and
deep	 Kleinian	 interpretations	 made	 by	 the
members	of	that	school	(see	KLEIN)	are	legitimate
psychoanalysis	or	represent	wild	analysis.	There	is
no	
agreement	
on	
this	
question.	
Most
psychoanalysts	
agree	
that	
early	
deep
interpretations	are	experienced	by	the	patient	as
an	 assault	 and	 may	 have	 an	 important	 effect	 on
the	 therapeutic	 alliance,	 either	 fracturing	 it	 or
shifting	 it	 into	 a	 sadomasochistic	 relationship.
Conversely,	sadistic	psychoanalysts	tend	to	make
early	deep	wild	interpretations.
Granting	the	psychoanalyst	has	had	a	thorough
personal	psychoanalysis,	the	question	often	arises
as	to	what	extent	his	or	her	technique	represents
an	 identification	 with	 his	 or	 her	 own	 training
psychoanalyst.	 To	 even	 further	 complicate	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1358
matter,	one	must	admit	that	wild	psychoanalysis
sometimes	 works!	 It	 is	 a	 form	 of	 charismatic
therapy.	Groddeck	(1961)	labeled	himself	a	“wild
analyst”	 somewhat	 to	 the	 perturbation	 of	 Freud,
and	
was	
able	
to	
accomplish	
considerable
improvement	in	various	psychosomatic	disorders
by	his	deep	charismatic	and	“wild”	interpretations.
This	 is	 no	 longer	 psychoanalysis,	 but	 a	 form	 of
suggestion	therapy	in	which	the	patient	forms	an
idealizing	 transference	 with	 the	 charismatic
doctor	 and	 feels	 better,	 protected,	 and	 in	 the
hands	of	an	omnipotent	healer.
For	a	current	view	of	this	controversial	topic,

WINNICOTT,	DONALD	W.
At	 the	 beginning	 of	 this	 century,	 Freud
established	the	ubiquity	of	the	role	of	unconscious
instinctual	
wishes	
and	
conflicts	
in	
the
development	 of	 the	 human	 individual.	 He	 also
invented	a	therapeutic	setting	and	process,	which
he	named	psychoanalysis,	in	which	these	conflicts
could	be	discovered,	explored,	and	resolved.	The
emphasis	 was	 upon	 knowing	 and	 insight.	 In
England	 Donald	 W.	 Winnicott	 (1897-1971),	 a
pediatrician	 before	 becoming	 a	 psychoanalyst,
from	his	deep	involvement	with	infants	and	their
caretaking	mothers,	took	the	next	logical	step	and
enlarged	the	scope	of	the	psychotherapeutic	task
to	include	realization	of	and	meeting	the	need	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1360
the	patient	as	a	person.	Winnicott	had	a	long	and
distinguished	 career	 as	 a	 fellow	 of	 the	 Royal
College	 of	 Physicians,	 a	 fellow	 of	 the	 British
Psychological	 Society,	 president	 of	 the	 British
Psychoanalytical	 Society,	 and	 president	 of	 the
pediatric	section	of	the	Royal	Society	of	Medicine.
He	 was	 awarded	 the	 James	 Spence	 Medal	 for
Pediatrics	in	1968.	His	researches	in	this	area	have
had	a	momentous	impact	on	the	whole	nature	of
the	 therapeutic	 undertaking,	 in	 which,	 according
to	Winnicott,	the	therapist	patiently	waits	for	the
patient’s	
own	
creative	
unfolding	
from
formlessness	to	reintegration.
Winnicott	models	his	clinical	orientation	to	the
patient	 largely	 on	 an	 “ordinary	 and	 devoted
mother’s”	holding	care	of	her	infant.	He	writes	of
the	“average	expectable	environment”	as	essential
to	the	growth	of	the	health	and	personality	in	the
child,	and	the	important	element	in	it	is	the	“good
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1361
enough	 mother.”	 The	 capacity	 of	 the	 secure
mother	 to	 provide	 security	 for	 her	 baby	 is
described	 by	 Winnicott	 as	 primary	 maternal
preoccupation.	 Winnicott	 (1965)	 introduces	 his
important	concept	of	“basic	ego	relatedness.”	This
conceptualizes	what	a	good-enough	mother-infant
relationship	 does	 for	 the	 child	 in	 terms	 of	 an
experience	 that	 lasts	 for	 a	 lifetime	 and	 of	 a
foundation	upon	which	all	the	child’s	later	growth
can	 take	 place.	 The	 sense	 of	 belonging,	 of	 being
securely	in	touch	that	grows	in	the	baby	from	the
mother’s	loving	reliability,	becomes	an	established
property	of	his	psyche.
Winnicott	 (1968)	 believes	 that,	 apart	 from
interpersonal	relations,	an	ego	or	true	self	never
develops	at	all.	He	concentrates	on	the	beginnings
of	 the	 ego	 and	 argues	 that	 the	 differentiation	 of
subject	 and	 object	 out	 of	 the	 state	 of	 primary
identification	stimulates	the	beginning	of	specific
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1362
ego	development.	The	growth	of	the	experience	of
basic	 ego	 relatedness,	 and	 therefore	 of	 the
capacity	 both	 to	 enter	 into	 object	 relations	 and
also	to	be	alone	without	anxiety	and	insecurity,	is
based	 on	 the	 early	 relationship	 between	 the
mother	and	the	infant—	“the	nursing	couple.”
In	chapter	3	of	The	Maturational	Processes	and
the	 Facilitating	 Environment	 (1965)	 Winnicott
presents	
his	
theory	
of	
the	
parent-infant
relationship.	He	argues	that	infant	development	is
facilitated	 by	 good-enough	 maternal	 care	 and	 is
distorted	 by	 maternal	 care	 that	 is	 not	 good
enough.	The	infant	ego	can	be	said	to	be	weak,	but
in	 fact	 is	 strong	 because	 of	 the	 ego	 support	 of
maternal	 care.	 Processes	 in	 the	 mother	 and	 the
father	 bring	 about	 a	 special	 state	 in	 which	 the
parent	 is	 oriented	 to	 the	 infant	 and	 thus	 in	 a
position	to	meet	the	infant’s	dependence.
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1363
Winnicott’s	concept	of	“holding”	is	defined	as	a
protection	 from	 physiologic	 insult	 that	 takes
account	of	the	infant’s	skin	sensitivity	and	includes
the	whole	routine	of	care	throughout	the	day	and
night.	 It	 is	 not	 the	 same	 with	 any	 two	 infants
because	it	is	part	of	the	infant	and	no	two	infants
are	 alike.	 Also,	 it	 follows	 the	 minute	 day-to-day
changes	 belonging	 to	 the	 infant’s	 growth	 and
development,	both	physical	and	psychological.
In	 The	 Family	 and	 Individual	 Development
(1968)	Winnicott	explains	how	if	the	environment
is	not	reliable,	a	hidden	true	self	forms.	All	we	can
see,	however,	is	a	false	self	engaged	in	the	double
task	of	hiding	the	true	self	and	of	complying	with
the	demands	that	the	world	makes	from	moment
to	moment.	When	there	is	very	early	failure	in	the
holding	 stage	 of	 infancy,	 the	 tremendous	 anxiety
provoked	 by	 this	 experience	 is	 followed	 by	 the
building	 up	 of	 a	 false	 self	 in	 order	 to	 save	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1364
infant	from	total	disintegration.	In	other	cases,	the
false	self	disguises	the	true	self	which	exists	only
as	a	potential	and	is	allowed	a	secret	life.	In	health
the	 false	 self	 is	 represented	 by	 the	 whole
organization	 of	 the	 polite	 and	 mannered	 social
attitude,	something	that	is	adaptable.
Winnicott’s	
view	
of	
the	
basic
psychotherapeutic	 relationship	 rests	 squarely	 on
his	concept	of	the	maturational	processes	and	the
facilitating	environment.	Only	the	mother	who	is
capable	 of	 primary	 maternal	 preoccupation	 and
identification	with	her	baby	is	capable	of	giving	it
a	sound	start	in	ego	development.	This	view	plants
human	personality	squarely	in	the	soil	of	personal
object	 relationships	 as	 the	 starting	 point	 of	 all
human	living.	It	is	clear,	then,	that	the	earlier	the
cause	 of	 trouble	 is	 in	 the	 patient,	 the	 more
fundamental	is	his	or	her	ego	weakness,	and	the
more	 profoundly	 important	 is	 the	 quality	 of	 the
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1365
therapeutic	personal	relationship.
Winnicott	
distinguished	
between
psychoanalysis	
for	
oedipal	
cases	
and
“management”	for	preoedipal	cases,	where	initial
good-enough	 mothering	 cannot	 be	 taken	 for
granted.	For	these	sicker	patients,	Winnicott	takes
the	 mother-infant	 relationship	 as	 the	 model	 for
and	 the	 basis	 of	 psychotherapy.	 Our	 personal
knowing	of	the	patient,	working	by	empathy	and
intuition,	seems	to	be	the	essence	of	the	therapy.
Winnicott’s	idea	is	that	patients	who	have	suffered
serious	
disturbances	
of	
the	
mother-child
symbiosis	early	in	life	will	not	get	well	unless	the
therapist	“behaves.”	(Of	course,	this	concept	of	the
therapist	 behaving	 is	 a	 shibboleth	 and	 covers	 a
great	 deal	 of	 the	 patient-therapist	 interaction,	 as
described	 at	 length	 by	 Winnicott	 [1958]	 in
chapters	 22	 and	 23	 of	 the	 Collected	 Papers.)
Winnicott	divides	Freud’s	classical	psychoanalysis
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1366
into	two	parts.	First,	there	is	the	technique	as	it	is
gradually	 developed	 and	 in	 which	 the	 material
presented	by	the	patient	is	to	be	understood	and
to	 be	 interpreted.	 Second,	 there	 is	 the	 setting	 in
which	 this	 work	 is	 carried	 through.	 Winnicott
enumerates	 in	 some	 detail	 certain	 points	 which
seem	obvious	but	tend	to	be	overlooked	about	the
setting.
Three	 of	 Winnicott’s	 papers	 have	 vital
implications	for	the	therapeutic	relationship.	The
importance	of	hate	in	the	countertransference	and
the	 countertransference	 itself	 are	 discussed	 in
detail	 in	 two	 classic	 papers	 (The	 Maturational
Processes	
and	
the	
Facilitating	
Environment,
chapter	 14,	 and	 Collected	 Papers,	 chapter	 15).
Winnicott’s	 most	 famous	 paper	 is	 “Transitional
Objects	 and	 Transitional	 Phenomena”	 in	 the
Collected	Papers,	chapter	18	(see	OBJECT).

WORKING	ALLIANCE
(see	THERAPEUTIC	ALLIANCE)
WORKING	THROUGH
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1368
Freud	(1914)	discussed	the	problem	of	“a	trial
of	patience”	for	the	therapist	during	the	working
through	
of	
resistances.	
The	
first	
step	
in
overcoming	 resistance,	 he	 said,	 is	 made	 by
uncovering	the	resistance	and	at	least	acquainting
the	 patient	 with	 it	 intellectually.	 However,	 “One
must	 allow	 the	 patient	 time	 to	 become	 more
conversant	with	this	resistance	with	which	he	has
now	 become	 acquainted,	 to	 work	 through	 it,	 to
overcome	 it,	 by	 continuing,	 in	 defiance	 of	 it,	 the
analytic	work	according	to	the	fundamental	rule	of
analysis”	 (p.	 155).	 In	 these	 situations	 a	 sense	 of
growing	 impatience	 in	 the	 therapist	 is	 an
important	 manifestation	 of	 countertransference
(see	PATIENCE).
Working	 through	 means	 going	 over	 the	 same
insights	 again	 and	 again,	 applying	 them	 to	 more
and	more	situations,	and	helping	the	patient	make
significant	and	lasting	changes	as	a	consequence	of
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1369
new	
compromise	
formations.	
These	
new
compromise	 formations	 occur	 as	 a	 result	 of
interpretations	 which	 acquaint	 the	 patient	 with
older	 unconscious	 and	 maladaptive	 compromise
formations,	 giving	 the	 patient	 another	 chance.
Sedler	(1983)	points	out	how	repeating	enslaves
the	ego.	Remembering	through	interpretation	can
lead	to	working	through,	which	gives	distance	to
the	 search	 for	 repeating	 and	 leads	 to	 increased
autonomy	in	the	patient.
Freud	
explained	
the	
resistance	
to
interpretations	 after	 they	 have	 been	 made	 as	 “id
resistance”	 (see	 ADHESIVENESS	 OF	 THE	 LIBIDO
and	
RESISTANCE).	
He	
had	
in	
mind	
that
compromise	 formations	 which	 were	 in	 place	 for
decades	 rarely	 collapsed	 and	 were	 replaced	 by
new	ones	simply	on	the	basis	of	an	interpretation.
This	 is	 why	 considerable	 time	 and	 effort	 is
required	 to	 expand	 and	 modify	 interpretations
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1370
until	they	become	maximally	effective	in	achieving
change	in	the	patient.	Thus	working	through	is	a
crucial	 aspect	 of	 the	 psychoanalytic	 process,	 and
raises	 the	 issue	 of	 to	 what	 extent	 this	 prolonged
process	
represents	
suggestion	
out	
of	
the
intersubjective	 experience	 of	 the	 patient	 and	 the
analyst.	 In	 effective	 psychoanalytic	 work	 this
problem	
seems	
less	
apparent	
because
interpretations	 during	 the	 working	 through
process	 consist	 chiefly	 in	 showing	 how	 the
interpretation	 applies	 in	 many	 different	 contexts
of	the	patient’s	thoughts,	fantasies,	and	behavior,
rather	than	in	persuasion,	and	is	carried	out	by	a
calm	craftsperson,	not	a	rhetorician.
Nevertheless,	 working	 through	 is	 dependent
on	
the	
character	
and	
orientation	
of	
the
psychoanalyst	 who	 cannot	 wholly	 avoid	 being	 a
teacher,	a	definer	of	reality,	an	exemplar	of	a	value
system,	and	hence	an	influence	on	the	patient.	This
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1371
leaves	 working	 through	 as	 somewhat	 ill	 defined
and	 usually	 attached	 to	 periods	 of	 the	 analysis
where	 little	 progress	 is	 being	 made.	 When
interpretations	seem	to	be	having	little	effect,	the
idea	of	id	resistance	comes	up	and	the	necessity	of
working	through	is	offered	as	an	effective	means
of	 countering	 it.	 But	 this	 id	 resistance	 or
adhesiveness	 of	 the	 libido	 really	 represents	 the
fact	 that	 patients	 have	 their	 own	 internal
timetable	
of	
integrating	
and	
applying
interpretations	 in	 a	 way	 that	 produces	 lasting
structural	change.	Patients	cannot	be	hurried.
Of	course,	there	is	also	the	possibility	that	the
analyst	has	failed	to	discover	hidden	transference
situations	
that	
impede	
the	
acceptance	
of
interpretation.	 An	 example	 of	 this	 is	 the
humiliation	certain	patients	feel	upon	hearing	any
interpretation,	 since	 it	 means	 the	 analyst	 knows
more	 than	 the	 patient.	 As	 a	 revenge	 the	 patient
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1372
may	 resist	 and	 object	 to	 the	 interpretation,	 or
refuse	to	work	with	it,	or	to	apply	it	to	his	or	her
thinking	and	life.	What	would	be	necessary	in	this
situation	 would	 be	 a	 recognition	 of	 the	 patient’s
sensitivity,	
and	
further	
interpretation	
and
discussion	of	the	patient’s	reaction	to	narcissistic
wounding.
Working	through	can	all	too	easily	degenerate
into	 the	 therapist’s	 “hammering”	 on	 a	 given
interpretation	 or	 point	 of	 view	 until	 the	 patient
surrenders	or	undergoes	a	massive	introjection	of
the	 therapist	 as	 an	 identification	 with	 the
aggressor.	 This	 may	 lead	 to	 a	 rigid	 identification
with	the	therapist,	which	was	a	common	problem
in	 the	 early	 days	 of	 training	 psychoanalyses.
Highly	
charged	
clinging	
to	
the	
therapist’s
personality	traits	and	theories	as	a	result	of	poor
or	incomplete	training	analysis	partly	accounts	for
the	 early	 tendency	 of	 splits	 to	 occur	 in
www.freepsychotherapybooks.org
1373
psychoanalytic	organizations,	with	little	groups	of
followers	 or	 “disciples”	 clustered	 around	 each
charismatic	training	analyst	(see	CORRUPTION).
Working	 through	 can	 be	 looked	 at	 as	 a
necessary	 and	 time-consuming	 process	 based	 on
the	inherent	timetable	of	the	patient,	or	it	can	be
looked	 at	 as	 having	 to	 do	 with	 the	 patient’s
resistance	
to	
the	
therapist’s	
interpretation,
requiring	
further	
psychoanalytic	
efforts.
Depending	 on	 one’s	 definition	 of	 resistance	 (see
RESISTANCE),	both	of	these	can	be	true.	Working
through	 can	 be	 thought	 of	 constructively	 or
pejoratively.	 Samuel	 Johnson	 (1773)	 defines
working	as	“to	labor;	to	travail;	to	toil”	(p.	2263),
and	that	is	the	essence	of	working	through.
For	 a	 thorough	 review	 of	 the	 development	 of
this	 concept	 from	 1914	 to	 1984	 see	 Brenner
(1987).
