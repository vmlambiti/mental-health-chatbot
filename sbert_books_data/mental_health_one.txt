Mental disorders are diseases that affect cognition, emotion,
and behavioral control and substantially interfere both with the
ability of children to learn and with the ability of adults to
function in their families, at work, and in the broader society.
Mental disorders tend to begin early in life and often run a
chronic recurrent course. They are common in all countries
where their prevalence has been examined. Because of the
combination of high prevalence, early onset, persistence, and
impairment, mental disorders make a major contribution to
total disease burden. Although most of the burden attributable
to mental disorders is disability related, premature mortality,
especially from suicide, is not insignificant. Table 31.1 summa-
rizes discounted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for
selected psychiatric conditions in 2001.
Mental disorders have complex etiologies that involve inter-
actions among multiple genetic and nongenetic risk factors.
Gender is related to risk in many cases: males have higher rates
of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and sub-
stance use disorders; females have higher rates of major depres-
sive disorder, most anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.
Biochemical and morphological abnormalities of the brain
associated with schizophrenia, autism, mood, and anxiety dis-
orders are being identified using approaches such as post-
mortem analysis and noninvasive neuroimaging. Major world-
wide efforts under way to identify risk-conferring genes for
mental disorders are proving challenging, but initial results are
promising. Identifying the gene or genes causing or creating
vulnerability for a disorder should help us understand what
goes wrong in the brain to produce mental illness and should
have a clinical effect by contributing to improved diagnostics
and therapeutics (Hyman 2000).
Twin studies make it clear that environmental risk factors
also play an important role in mental disorders;concordance for
disease among identical twins, although substantially higher
than among nonidentical twins, is still well below 100 percent
(Kendler and others 2003). However, as is the case for genetic
factors, investigation of environmental risk factors has proved
difficult. For schizophrenia, where nongenetic components of
risk may include obstetrical complications and season of birth
(Mortensen and others 1999), perhaps as a proxy for infections
early in life, research has been hampered by the modest proven
effect of the nongenetic risk factors identified to date. For
depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, where envi-
ronmental risk factors are more robust, adverse circumstances
associated with risk, such as early childhood abuse, violence,
poverty, and stress (Patel and Kleinman 2003) correlate with
multiple disorders and could be affected by selection bias as well
asbybiasassociatedwithself-reporting.Generalizable,prospec-
tive cross-cultural studies are needed to delineate nongenetic
risk factors more clearly. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
is the mental disorder for which clear environmental triggers are
best documented.Even here,though,enormous interindividual
variability occurs in the threshold of stress severity associated
withPTSDaswellasintheevidencefromtwinstudiesof genetic
influences on stress reactivity in triggering PTSD.
The last half of the 20th century saw enormous progress in
the development of treatments for mental disorders. Beginning
in the early 1950s, effective psychotropic drugs were discovered
that treated the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
major depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and others.
The safety and efficacy of antipsychotic, mood-stabilizing,

antidepressant, anxiolytic, and stimulant drugs have been
established through a large number of randomized clinical
trials. Psychosocial treatments have been developed and tested
using modern methodologies. Brief, symptom-focused psy-
chotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapies have been
shown to be efficacious for panic disorder, phobias, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and major depression.
There is, however, an important caveat about the current
knowledge base for treatment. As is the case for almost all of
medicine, randomized clinical trials have been performed
largely with highly selected populations in specialized research
settings in industrial countries. A need exists to subject existing
treatments to effectiveness trials in more representative popu-
lations and diverse settings, especially in developing countries.
That limitation notwithstanding, a substantial body of knowl-
edge exists to guide treatment. It is particularly unfortunate,
therefore, that timely diagnoses and the application of
research-based treatments significantly lag behind the state of
knowledge in industrial and developing countries alike. As a
result, substantial opportunities exist to decrease the enormous
burden attributable to mental disorders worldwide by closing
the gap between what we know and what we do.
Mental disorders are stigmatized in many countries and
cultures (Weiss and others 2001). Stigma has been facilitated
by the slow emergence of convincing scientific explanations for
the etiologies of mental disorders and by the mistaken belief
that symptoms are caused by a lack of will power or reflect some
moral taint. Recent scientific findings combined with educa-
tional efforts in some countries have begun to reduce the stigma
(Rahman and others 1998), but shame and fear associated with

mental illness remain substantial obstacles to help seeking, to
diagnosis, and to treatment worldwide. The stigmatization of
mental illness has resulted in disparities, compared with other
illnesses, in the availability of care, in research, and in abuses of
the human rights of people with these disorders.
This chapter focuses on the attributable and avoidable
burden of four leading contributors to mental ill health globally:
schizophrenia and related nonaffective psychoses, bipolar
affective disorder (manic-depressive illness), major depressive
disorder, and panic disorder. The choice of these disorders is
determined not only by their contribution to disease burden,
but also by the availability of data for the cost-effectiveness
analyses.Even where such data are available,they are often from
industrial countries and extrapolation has been necessary. The
exclusion of other mental disorders, such as childhood disor-
ders,from analysis is not because the authors consider these dis-
orders unimportant but because of the paucity of data.Also,this
chapter does not specifically deal with the important issue of
suicide.A background paper on suicide in developing countries
has been developed as part of the Disease Control Priorities
Project (DCPP) and is available (Vijayakumar, Nagaraj, and
John 2004). The economic analysis presented in this chapter
uses the cost-effectiveness analysis methodology specifically
developed for the DCPP. The authors recognize that mental
disorders impose costs and burdens on families as well as
individuals that are not captured by the DALY. Treatment will
alleviate some of this burden in addition to alleviating symp-
toms and disability.
A description of the major clinical features, natural course,
epidemiology, burden, and treatment effectiveness for each
group of disorders is given in the next section. For diagnostic
criteria, readers are referred to The ICD-10 Classification of
Mental and Behavioral Disorders (ICD-10) (WHO 1992) or
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-
IVTR) (American Psychiatric Association 2000). A discussion
follows of population-level costs and cost-effectiveness of inter-
ventions capable of reducing the current burden associated
with four disorders in different developing regions of the world
(tables 31.2–31.6), before moving to a discussion of key issues
and implications for mental health policy and improvement of
services in developing regions of the world.
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND NONAFFECTIVE
PSYCHOSES
Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder punctuated by episodes of
florid psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delu-
sions. Hallucinations are sensory perceptions that occur in the
absence of appropriate stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in
any sensory modality but in schizophrenia are most commonly
auditory—for example, hearing voices or noises. Delusions are
fixed false beliefs that are not explained by the person’s culture
and that the patient holds despite all reasonable evidence to the
contrary.
Patients also exhibit negative symptoms—that is, deficits in
normal capacities, such as marked social deficits, impoverish-
ment of thought and speech, blunting of emotional responses,
and lack of motivation. Additionally, patients typically have
cognitive symptoms, such as disorganized or illogical thinking
and an inability to hold goal information in mind to make
decisions or plan actions.
Natural History and Course
Schizophrenia, as defined in current diagnostic manuals, is
almost certainly heterogeneous, but still does not comprise all
nonaffective psychoses (NAPs). In addition to schizophrenia,
NAPsincludeschizophreniformdisorder,characterizedbyschiz-
ophrenia-like symptoms of inadequate duration to qualify as
schizophrenia. Because they cannot be readily disentangled in
community epidemiological surveys, schizophrenia and other
NAPsareconsideredtogether.Becauseof thedataavailable,how-
ever,the cost-effectiveness analyses reported below are restricted
to schizophrenia.Despite likely etiological heterogeneity,schizo-
phrenia exhibits consistency in its symptom pattern across those
countries and cultures studied (Jablensky and others 1992).
Incidence studies show that onset of schizophrenia and
other NAPs is typically in middle to late adolescence for males
and late adolescence to early adulthood for females, although
later onsets are observed. Childhood-onset cases are quite rare
but particularly severe (Nicolson and Rapoport 1999). Often,
schizophrenia is first diagnosed with the occurrence of an acute
episode of florid psychotic symptoms. The first psychotic
episodeisoftenprecededbyprodromalsymptomssuchassocial
withdrawal, irritability or dysphoria, increasing academic or
work-related difficulties, and increasing eccentricity. However,
such symptoms are not specific; studies of whether early diag-
nosis and intervention can improve outcomes are under way
(McGorry and others 2002).
The course of schizophrenia is typically one of acute exacer-
bations of severe psychotic symptoms, followed by full or par-
tial remission. Psychotic episodes may be followed by a full
remission after the first and occasionally other early episodes,
but over time, residual symptoms and disability typically con-
tinue between relapses (Robinson and others 1999). The time
between relapses is markedly extended by maintenance treat-
ment with antipsychotic drugs, generally at lower doses than
are needed to treat acute episodes. Cognitive and occupational
functioning tends to decline over the first years of the illness
and then to plateau at a level that is generally well below what
would have been expected for the individual. Residual impair-
ment, though, has substantial cross-cultural variation for
reasons that are not well understood. Schizophrenia has consis-
tently been found in epidemiological surveys to be highly
Mental Disorders | 607
comorbid, usually with anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and
substance use disorders (Kendler and others 1996).
Epidemiology and Burden
A great many studies of NAP incidence have been carried out in
clinical samples. In a review of these studies, Jablensky (2000)
found incidence estimates to be in the range of 0.002 to 0.011
percent per year for schizophrenia and 0.016 to 0.042 percent
per year for overall NAP. Those annual estimates can be multi-
plied by the number of birth cohorts at risk to yield an estimate
of lifetime risk in any one cohort. Assuming conservatively that
the main age range of risk is between ages 15 and 55,researchers
estimate lifetime risk is in the range of 0.08 to 0.44 percent for
schizophrenia and in the range of 0.64 to 1.68 percent for NAPs.
Lifetime prevalence estimates from community epidemio-
logical surveys of NAPs are quite consistent with those from
clinical studies, in the range of 0.3 to 1.6 percent (see, for exam-
ple, Hwu, Yeh, and Cheng 1989; Kendler and others 1996).
Although schizophrenia is a relatively uncommon disorder,
aggregate estimates of disease burden are high—around 2,000
DALYs lost per 1 million total population (table 31.1)—
because the condition is associated with early onset, long dura-
tion, and severe disability.
Interventions
A substantial body of evidence exists on the efficacy of various
treatments for schizophrenia and NAP and on the effectiveness
of various models of health care delivery for persons with these
disorders. This evidence comes primarily from industrial coun-
tries. The efficacy data show conclusively that antipsychotic
drugs reduce severity of the episodes, hasten resolution of
florid symptoms, and reduce duration of hospitalization.
Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs prolongs the
period between relapses (Joy, Adams, and Lawrie 2001).
A second generation of antipsychotic medications (also
called atypical) is replacing older neuroleptic antipsychotic
drugs throughout the industrial world. In some clinical trials,
second-generation drugs show small advantages in efficacy
over first-generation drugs, but their widespread adoption
results from marked improvement in tolerability. Their relative
lack of side effects compared with first-generation drugs has
led to improved quality of life and improved treatment adher-
ence. Second-generation drugs are not without side effects,
however; for example, some are associated with substantial
weight gain and increased risk of diabetes. One drug, clozapine,
has greater efficacy than other antipsychotic drugs, but because
of a 1 percent risk of agranulocytosis, its use requires weekly
blood counts and is cumbersome and expensive.
Psychosocial interventions also play an important role in
managing schizophrenia (Bustillo and others 2001). Cognitive-
behavioral approaches to managing specific symptoms and
improving medication adherence, group therapy, and family
interventions all have demonstrated efficacy in improving
clinical outcomes. Community-based models of mental health
care delivery with case management and assertive outreach
programs have been shown in health systems of industrial
countries to be effective ways of managing schizophrenia in the
community, for example, by reducing the need for hospital
admissions. However, the applicability of these models to
developing countries, as is discussed later, is hard to estimate
because of differences in health system characteristics. Long-
term remission rates for schizophrenia in developing countries
appear to be significantly higher than those reported in indus-
trial countries (Harrison and others 2001), likely resulting from
such factors as strong family social support.
Despite their clear usefulness, current treatments do not
prevent schizophrenia, and no clear evidence demonstrates that
they induce full recovery or prevent premature mortality.
Instead, treatment reduces time in episode of florid psychosis
and increases time between episodes; thus treatment effects can
be understood in terms of improvements in disability.Reported
treatment effect sizes from meta-analyses in the literature, con-
verted into improvements in the average level of disability
(Andrews and others 2003; Sanderson and others 2004), show
improvements (compared with no treatment) of 18 to 19 per-
cent (antipsychotic drugs alone) and 30 to 31 percent (antipsy-
chotic drugs with adjunctive psychosocial treatment). Placed
on a disability scale of 0 to 1, where 0 equals no disability, an
“average” case of schizophrenia moves from a disability level of
0.63 (untreated weight from the Global Burden of Disease
study, Murray and Lopez 1996) to 0.43 to 0.54 (treated).
MOOD DISORDERS
The cardinal features of mood disorders are pervasive abnor-
malities in the predominant emotional state of the person, such
as depressed, elated, or irritable. In mood disorders, these core
emotional symptoms are accompanied by abnormalities in
physiology, such as changes in patterns of sleep, appetite, and
energy, and by changes in cognition and behavior. In develop-
ing countries, concurrent somatic symptoms are also com-
monly reported and may be the chief complaint. A generally
accepted subclassification of mood disorders distinguishes
unipolar depressive disorders from bipolar disorder (defined
by the occurrence of mania). This distinction is based on
symptoms, course of illness, patterns of familial transmission,
and treatment response.
Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and
depression, often followed by relative periods of healthy mood
608 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Steven Hyman, Dan Chisholm, Ronald Kessler, and others
(euthymia). Mixed states with symptoms of both mania and
depression also occur. Mania is typically characterized by
euphoria or irritability, a marked increase in energy, and a
decreased need for sleep. Individuals with mania often exhibit
intrusive, impulsive, and disinhibited behaviors. They may be
excessively involved in goal-directed behaviors characterized
by poor judgment; for example, a person might spend all
funds to which he or she has access and more. Self-esteem is
typically inflated, frequently reaching delusional proportions.
Speech is often rapid and difficult to interrupt. Individuals
with mania also may exhibit cognitive symptoms; patients can-
not stick to a topic and may jump rapidly from idea to idea,
making comprehension of their train of thought difficult.
Psychotic symptoms are common during manic episodes. The
depressive episodes of people with bipolar disorder are symp-
tomatically indistinguishable from those who have unipolar
depressions alone. Unlike anxiety and unipolar mood disor-
ders, which are more common in women, bipolar disorder has
an equal gender ratio of lifetime prevalence, although the ratio
of depressive-to-manic episodes is higher among bipolar
women than men.
Natural History and Course. Retrospective reports from com-
munity epidemiological surveys consistently show that bipolar
disorder has an early age of onset (in the late teens through mid-
20s). Onset in childhood is increasingly recognized, although
it remains controversial. Late onset is less common. The vast
majority of patients with bipolar disorder have recurrent
episodes of illness, both mania and depression. Classic descrip-
tions of bipolar disorder suggest recovery to baseline function-
ing between episodes, but many patients have residual symp-
toms that may cause significant impairment (Angst and Sellaro
2000). These states of mania, depression, and lesser (or absent)
symptoms are used in the intervention analysis below.
The rate of cycling between mania and depression varies
widely among individuals. One common pattern of illness is
for episodes initially to be separated by a relatively long period,
perhaps a year, and then to become more frequent with age. A
minority of patients with four or more cycles per year, termed
rapid cyclers, tend to be more disabled and less responsive to
existing treatments. Once cycles are established, most acute
episodes start without an identifiable precipitant; the best doc-
umented exception is that manic episodes may be initiated by
sleep deprivation, making a regular daily sleep schedule and
avoidance of shift work important in management (Frank,
Swartz, and Kupfer 2000).
Bipolar disorder has consistently been found in epidemio-
logical surveys to be highly comorbid with other psychiatric
disorders, especially anxiety and substance use disorders
(ten Have and others 2002). The extent of comorbidity is much
greater than for unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety
disorders. Some individuals with classic symptoms of bipolar
disorder also exhibit chronic psychotic symptoms superim-
posed on their mood syndrome. These individuals are said to
have schizoaffective disorder. Their prognosis tends to be less
favorable than for the usual bipolar patient,although somewhat
better than for individuals with schizophrenia. Schizoaffective
disorder may also be diagnosed when chronic psychotic symp-
toms are superimposed on unipolar depression. Individuals
with this combination of symptoms have outcomes similar to
patients with schizophrenia (Tsuang and Coryell 1993).
Epidemiology and Burden. Lifetime and 12-month preva-
lence estimates of bipolar disorder have been reported from a
number of community psychiatric epidemiological surveys.
Lifetime prevalence estimates are in the range 0.1 to 2.0 percent
(Vega and others 1998; Vicente and others 2002), with a
weighted mean across surveys of 0.7 percent. Prevalence esti-
mates for past-year episodes have a similarly wide range (0.1 to
1.3 percent) (Vega and others 1998) and a weighted mean of
0.5 percent. It is important to note that good evidence exists
suggesting that bipolar disorder has a wide subthreshold spec-
trum that includes people who are often seriously impaired
even though they do not meet full DSM or ICD criteria for the
disorder (Perugi and Akiskal 2002). This spectrum might
include as much as 5 percent of the general population. The
ratio of recent-to-lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder in
community surveys is quite high (0.71), indicating that bipolar
disorder is persistent.
Epidemiological data show that bipolar disorder is associ-
ated with substantial impairments in both productive and
social roles (Das Gupta and Guest 2002). Epidemiological evi-
dence documents consistent delays in patients initially seeking
professional treatment (Olfson and others 1998), especially
among early-onset cases, as well as substantial undertreatment
of current cases. Each of these characteristics—chronic, recur-
rent course; significant impairments to functioning; modest
treatment rates—contributes to estimates of aggregate disease
burden that approach those for schizophrenia (1,200 to 1,800
DALYs lost per 1 million population, making up more than
5 percent of the burden attributable to neuropsychiatric disor-
ders as a whole—see table 31.1).
Interventions. Analyses of the primary treatment approaches
for bipolar disorder are based on the three health states that
characterize the disorder—mania, depression, and euthymia.
Robust evidence from controlled trials shows that antipsychot-
ic drugs and some benzodiazepines produce a relatively rapid
reduction in symptoms of a manic phase. Mood-stabilizing
drugs act more slowly, but they reduce the severity and dura-
tion of acute manic episodes. Maintenance treatment with two
mood-stabilizing drugs—lithium and valproic acid (adminis-
tered as sodium valproate)—has been shown to have
Mental Disorders | 609
significant, albeit partial, efficacy in reducing rates of both
manic and depressive relapses. The drawback of lithium is that
toxic levels are not much greater than therapeutic levels; thus,
serum-level monitoring is required.
For the cost-effectiveness analyses, lithium and valproic
acid, which have empirical data supporting their efficacy in
treating and preventing manic and depressive episodes, were
considered. Because evidence suggests that psychosocial
approaches enhance compliance with medication (Huxley,
Parikh, and Baldessarini 2000), adjuvant strategies also were
assessed. The primary treatment effect was a change in the
population-level disability associated with bipolar disorder (a
weighted average of time spent in a manic, depressed, or
euthymic phase of illness). Both an acute treatment effect—
calculated as the product of initial response and reduced
episode duration—and a prophylactic treatment effect were
ascribed to lithium and valproic acid, resulting in an estimated
improvement of close to 50 percent over the untreated com-
posite disability weight of 0.445 (Chisholm and others forth-
coming). This estimate then was adjusted for expected nonad-
herence to treatment in real-world clinical settings—slightly
lower for lithium than for valproic acid (Bowden and others
2000). A secondary effect of treatment—reduction of the case
fatality rate by two-thirds—was also ascribed to lithium,
though, because of an absence of current evidence, not to val-
proic acid (Goodwin and others 2003). This reduction was
derived through a change in the standardized mortality ratio
from 2.5 to 1.5, estimated on the basis of natural history stud-
ies reported for the prelithium era (for example, Astrup,
Fossum,and Holmboe 1959; Helgason 1964) to the postlithium
era (for example, Goodwin and others 2003).
Major Depressive Disorder
The core symptom of major depression is a disturbance of
mood; sadness is most typical, but anger, irritability, and loss of
interest in usual pursuits may predominate. Often the affected
person is unable to experience pleasure (anhedonia) and may
feel hopeless. In many countries of the developing world,
patients will not complain of such emotional symptoms, but
rather of physical symptoms, such as fatigue or multiple aches
and pains.
Typical physiological symptoms that occur across cultures
include sleep disturbance (most often insomnia with early
morning awakening, but occasionally excessive sleeping);
appetite disturbance (usually loss of appetite and weight loss,
but occasionally excessive eating); and decreased energy.
Behaviorally, some individuals with depression exhibit slowed
motor movements (psychomotor retardation), whereas others
may be agitated. Cognitive symptoms may include thoughts of
worthlessness and guilt, suicidal thoughts, difficulty concen-
trating, slow thinking, and poor memory. Psychotic symptoms
occur in a minority of cases.
Natural History and Course. Major depression is an episodic
disorder that generally begins early in life (median age of onset
in the mid to late 20s in community epidemiological surveys),
although new onsets can be observed across the lifespan.
Childhood onset is being increasingly recognized, although not
all childhood precursors of adult depression take the form of a
clear depressive disorder. Most individuals suffering from
a depressive episode will have a recurrence (Mueller and others
1999), with recurrence risk greater among those with early-
onset disease. Many individuals do not recover completely
from their acute episodes and have chronic milder depression
punctuated by acute exacerbations (Judd and others 1998). The
current term for chronic, milder depression lasting more than
two years is dysthymia. Although the symptoms of minor
depression are, by definition, less severe than those of a major
depressive episode, chronicity ultimately makes even this lesser
form of the illness very disabling in many cases (Judd, Schettler,
and Akiskal 2002). Depression has consistently been found in
epidemiological surveys to be highly comorbid with other
mental disorders, with roughly half the people who have a
history of depression also having a lifetime anxiety disorder.
Comorbidities of depression and anxiety disorders are genera-
lly strongest with generalized anxiety disorder and panic
disorder (Kessler and others 1996).
Epidemiology and Burden. Prevalence of nonbipolar depres-
sion has been estimated in a number of large-scale community
epidemiological surveys. Lifetime prevalence estimates of hav-
ing either major depressive disorder or dysthymia in these sur-
veys are in the range 4.2 to 17.0 percent (Andrade and others
2003; Bijl and others 1998), with a weighted mean of 12.1 per-
cent. Six- to 12-month prevalence estimates have a similarly
wide range (1.9 to 10.9 percent) (Andrade and others 2003;
Robins and Regier 1991), with a weighted mean of 5.8 percent.
These wide differences in prevalence likely represent the difficul-
ties inherent in self-reporting of conditions that are invariably
stigmatizedacrosscultures.Prevalenceestimatesareconsistently
highest in North America and lowest in Asia (with prevalence
estimates of major depressive disorders generally a good deal
higher than those of dysthymia).
Epidemiological data document consistent delays in
patients initially seeking professional treatment for depression,
especially among early-onset cases (Olfson and others 1998), as
well as substantial undertreatment. For example, World Mental
Health surveys in six Western European countries found that
only 36.6 percent of people with active nonbipolar depression
in the 12 months before the survey received any professional
treatment for this disorder during the subsequent year
610 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Steven Hyman, Dan Chisholm, Ronald Kessler, and others
Mental Disorders | 611
(ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators 2004). The situation is
even worse in developing countries, where the vast majority of
people with depression who seek help do so in general health
care settings and complain of nonspecific physical symptoms.
Such individuals receive a correct diagnosis in less than 
one-quarter of cases and typically are treated with medicines of
doubtful efficacy (Linden and others 1999).
Depression is consistently found in community surveys to
be associated with substantial impairments in both productive
and social roles (Wang, Simon, and Kessler 2003). As with
bipolar depression, but exacerbated by its high incidence, the
recurrent nature and disabling consequences of (unipolar)
depression mean that overall disease burden estimates are high
in all regions of the world (5,000 to 10,000 DALYs per 1 million
population, as much as 5 percent of the total burden of disease
from all causes; table 31.1). Depression is, in fact, ranked as the
fourth leading cause of disease burden globally and represents
the single largest contributor to nonfatal burden (Ustun and
others 2004).
Interventions. Efficacy has been demonstrated for several
classes of antidepressant drugs and for two psychosocial treat-
ments for depression (Paykel and Priest 1992). The older tri-
cyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and newer drugs, including the
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have similar
efficacy. The newer drugs have milder side-effect profiles and
are consequently more likely to be tolerated at therapeutic
doses (Pereira and Patel 1999). SSRIs have not been widely used
in developing countries because of their higher cost, although
as the patent protection expires, this situation is likely to
change (Patel 1996). Of the psychosocial treatments with
demonstrated efficacy, the most widely accepted are cognitive-
behavioral approaches.Alone or in combination, drug and psy-
chosocial treatments speed recovery from acute episodes.
Maintenance treatment with drugs decreases relapse risk
(Geddes and others 2003). Some evidence suggests that a
course of psychotherapy may also delay relapses. Although
most of the clinical trials have been carried out in industrial
countries, at least three high-quality trials have demonstrated
the efficacy of antidepressants, group therapy, or both in devel-
oping countries (Araya and others 2003; Bolton and others
2003; Patel and others 2003).
For the cost-effectiveness analyses, depression was modeled
as an episodic disorder with a high rate of remission and
subsequent recurrence, and with excess mortality from suicide
(Chisholm and others 2004). None of the selected depression
interventions was accorded a reduction in case fatality,however,
owing tothe lack of robust clinical evidence that antidepressants
or psychotherapy in themselves alter the relative risk of death by
suicide (Storosum and others 2001). The main modeled impact
of intervention targeted toward episodic treatment of a new
depressive episode was a reduction in the duration of time
depressed, equivalent to an increase in the remission rate (25 to
40 percent improvement over no treatment; Malt and others
1999; Solomon and others 1997). In addition, all interventions
were attributed a modest improvement in the level of disability
for an unremitted depressive episode (10 to 15 percent),
resulting from increased proportions of cases moving from
more to less severe health states. For the estimated 56 percent of
prevalent cases eligible for maintenance treatment (at least two
lifetime episodes), an additional effect of efficacious mainte-
nance treatment was incorporated into the analysis by reducing
the incidence of recurrent episodes by 50 percent (Geddes and
others 2003).Estimates of intervention effectiveness include the
positive change that would occur naturally and also incorporate
any placebo effect, which, in the treatment of depression, is not
inconsiderable (Andrews 2001).
ANXIETY DISORDERS
Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders that have as their
central feature the inability to regulate fear or worry. Although
anxiety in itself is likely to feature in the clinical presentation of
most patients, somatic complaints such as chest pain, palpita-
tions, respiratory difficulty, headaches, and the like are also
common, and these symptoms may be more common in
developing countries. A number of different types of anxiety
disorder exist, some of which are now briefly described.
The central feature of panic disorder is an unexpected panic
attack, which is a discrete period of intense fear accompanied
by physiologic symptoms such as a racing heart, shortness of
breath, sweating, or dizziness. The person may have an intense
fear of losing control or of dying. Panic disorder is diagnosed
when panic attacks are recurrent and give rise to anticipatory
anxiety about additional attacks. People with panic disorder
may progressively restrict their lives to avoid situations in
which panic attacks occur or situations from which it might be
difficult to escape should a panic attack occur. They common-
ly avoid crowds, traveling, bridges, and elevators, and ultimate-
ly some individuals may stop leaving home altogether.
Pervasive phobic avoidance is described as agoraphobia.
Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by chronic
unrealistic and excessive worry. These symptoms are accompa-
nied by specific anxiety-related symptoms such as sympathetic
nervous system arousal, excessive vigilance, and motor tension.
Posttraumatic stress disorder follows serious trauma. It is
characterized by emotional numbness, punctuated by intrusive
reliving of the traumatic episode, generally initiated by envi-
ronmental cues that act as reminders of the trauma; by dis-
turbed sleep; and by hyperarousal, such as exaggerated startle
responses.
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is characterized by a
persistentfearof socialsituationsorperformancesituationsthat
expose a person to potential scrutiny by others. The affected
person has intense fear that he or she will act in a way that will
be humiliating. Separating social anxiety disorder from
extremes of normal temperament, such as shyness, is difficult.
Nonetheless, social anxiety disorder can be quite disabling.
Simple phobias are extreme fear in the presence of discrete stim-
uli or cues, such as fear of heights.
The core features of obsessive-compulsive disorder are obses-
sions (intrusive, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (per-
formance of highly ritualized behaviors intended to neutralize
the negative thoughts and emotions resulting from the obses-
sions). One symptom pattern might be repetitive hand washing
beyond the point of skin damage to neutralize fears of
contamination.
Natural History and Course 
The anxiety disorders differ in their age of onset, course of ill-
ness, and symptom triggers. One of these disorders, PTSD, is
dependent for its etiology on one or more powerfully negative
life events. Although the anxiety disorders are discussed as a
group, panic disorder is chosen because of the available data for
the purposes of the cost-effectiveness analysis.
Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders based on commu-
nity epidemiological surveys vary widely, from a low of 2.2 per-
cent (Andrade and others 2003) to a high of 28.5 percent
(Kessler and others 1994), with a weighted mean across surveys
of 15.6 percent. Prevalence estimates for anxiety disorders in
the past 6 to 12 months have a similarly wide range (1.2 to
19.3 percent) (Andrade and others 2003; Kessler and others
1994), with a weighted mean of 9.4 percent. Despite wide
variation in overall prevalence, several clear relative prevalence
patterns can be seen across surveys. Specific phobia is generally
the most prevalent lifetime anxiety disorder, with social phobia
generally the second most prevalent lifetime anxiety disorder.
Panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder are generally
the least prevalent.
These surveys also provide evidence about the persistence of
anxiety disorders, indirectly defined as the ratio of 6-month or
12-month to lifetime prevalence. This ratio averages approxi-
mately 60 percent for overall anxiety disorders, indicating a
high rate of persistence across the life course. The highest
persistence is generally found for social phobia, and the lowest
for agoraphobia. These estimates of high persistence are con-
sistent with results obtained from longitudinal studies of
patients (Yonkers and others 2003).
Anxiety disorders have consistently been found in epidemio-
logical surveys to be highly comorbid both among themselves
and with mood disorders (for example, de Graaf and others
2003). The vast majority of people with a history of one anxiety
disorder typically also have a second anxiety disorder, while
more than half the people with a history of either anxiety or
mood disorder typically have both types of disorder.
Retrospective reports from community surveys consistently
show that anxiety disorders have early average ages of onset.
An impressive cross-national consistency can be seen in these
patterns, with an estimated median age of onset of anxiety at
approximately 15.
Epidemiological surveys have also looked at the treatment
of anxiety disorders. As with depression, consistent evidence in
these surveys suggests that delays in initially seeking profes-
sional treatment for an anxiety disorder are widespread after
first onset (Olfson and others 1998). This finding is especially
true among early-onset cases. Epidemiological data also show
that only a minority of current cases receive any formal treat-
ment in Western countries, whereas treatment of anxiety disor-
ders is virtually nonexistent in many developing countries. The
most recently published surveys, the World Mental Health
surveys in six Western European countries, found that only
26.3 percent of people with an active anxiety disorder in the
12 months before the survey received any professional treat-
ment (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators 2004).
Anxiety disorders have consistently been found to be associ-
ated with substantial impairments in both productive roles (for
example, work absenteeism, work performance, unemploy-
ment, and underemployment) and social roles (social isolation,
interpersonal tensions, and marital disruption, among others)
(see, for example, Kessler and Frank 1997). As noted earlier, for
the purposes of this chapter, one of the anxiety disorders—
panic disorder—has been chosen to describe interventions and
undertake cost-effectiveness analysis. Panic disorder is as dis-
abling as obsessive-compulsive disorder and PTSD, accounts
for about one-third of all seriously impairing anxiety disorders,
is one of the most common anxiety disorders presenting for
treatment, and imposes an estimated burden of 600 to 800
DALYs per 1 million population.
Good evidence exists that both drug and psychosocial
treatments are effective for managing anxiety disorders.
Antidepressant drugs (both older TCAs and SSRIs) have been
shown to be effective for the treatment of several anxiety disor-
ders, including panic disorder, reducing the duration and
intensity of the disorder. Although high-potency benzodi-
azepines are efficacious for panic disorder, these drugs carry a
risk of dependence and are not considered the first line of
treatment. Psychosocial treatments, especially cognitive-
behavioral therapy, are also effective in diminishing both panic
attacks and phobic avoidance.
Interventions for Panic Disorder
Although evidence-based interventions for panic disorder have
yet to be evaluated or made widely available in developing
612 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Steven Hyman, Dan Chisholm, Ronald Kessler, and others
countries, the potential population-level impact of a number of
interventions—including older and newer antidepressants,
anxiolytic drugs (benzodiazepines),
and psychosocial
treatments—was examined. Interventions reduce the severity
of panic attacks and improve the probability of making a full
recovery. Effect sizes for symptom improvement were drawn
from a meta-analysis of the long-term effects of intervention of
panic disorder (Bakker and others 1998) and converted into an
equivalent change in disability weight (Sanderson and others
2004). Concerning remission, a number of controlled and
naturalistic studies (for example, Faravelli, Paterniti, and
Scarpato 1995; Yonkers and others 2003) reveal a consistent
remission rate of 12 to 13 percent for pharmacological and
combination strategies—except for benzodiazepine use, for
which the evidence is that longer-term recovery is actually
worse than placebo (Katschnig and others 1995)—which repre-
sents a 62 percent improvement in efficacy over the untreated
remission rate (7.4 percent).
COST-EFFECTIVENESS METHODS AND RESULTS
This section estimates the burden attributed to schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, depression, and panic disorder that could be
averted (through scaling up) by proven, efficacious treatments.
It is followed by calculations of the expected cost and cost-
effectiveness of such treatments. Analysis is conducted at the
level of six low- and middle-income geographical World Bank
regions.
Estimation of Population-Level Effectiveness of Treatments
In modeling the impact of mental health interventions, we
used a state-transition model (Lauer and others 2003) that
traces the development of a population, taking into account
births, deaths, and the disease in question. In addition to pop-
ulation size and structure, the model makes use of a number of
epidemiological parameters (incidence and prevalence, remis-
sion, and cause-specific and residual rates of mortality) and
assigns age- and gender-specific disability weights to both the
disease in question and the general population. The output of
the model is an estimate of the total healthy life years experi-
enced by the population over a lifetime period (100 years). The
model was run for a number of possible scenarios, including no
treatment at all (natural history), current treatment coverage,
and scaled-up coverage of current as well as potential new
interventions. For the treatment scenarios, an implementation
period of 10 years was used (thereafter, epidemiological rates
and health state valuations return to natural history levels). The
model derived the number of additional healthy years gained
(equivalent to DALYs averted) each year in the population
compared with the outcome for no treatment at all. DALYs
averted in future years were discounted at a rate of 3 percent
(reflecting a societal preference for health benefits to be realized
sooner), but no age-weighting was used.
Estimation of the baseline epidemiological situation that
would prevail without treatment used incidence and preva-
lence estimates from the Global Burden of Disease 2000 study
of the World Health Organization (WHO) (see online Global
Burden of Disease documentation for the four disorders at
http://www.who.int/evidence/bod). Current pharmacolog-
ical or psychosocial treatments do not exert a primary preven-
tive effect on the onset of the four conditions (although
some evidence exists that treating depression in parents may
reduce risk for offspring), indicating that currently observed
incidence rates coincide with those that would pertain under
no treatment. Prevention of recurrences of acute episodes (sec-
ondary prevention) has been demonstrated for maintenance
treatments for major depression and bipolar disorder.
Maintenance treatment with antipsychotic drugs decreases the
risk of recurrent acute episodes of schizophrenia. For each con-
dition, a range of treatment strategies was considered and
assessed, including older (and widely available) psychothera-
peutic drugs, newer pharmacotherapies, psychosocial treat-
ments, and combination treatments (see table 31.2 for a list of
interventions included).
Estimation of Population-Level Treatment Costs
Cost estimation followed the principles and procedures
described in chapter 7for carrying out economic analyses of dis-
ease control priorities in developing countries. For depression
and panic disorder, treatment was assumed to occur in a pri-
mary care setting, whereas for schizophrenia and bipolar disor-
der, which often produce highly disruptive behaviors, both hos-
pital- and community-based outpatient service models were
derived and compared. Both program- and patient-level costs
were identified and estimated. Program-level costs included the
infrastructure and administrative support for implementing
mental health treatments, as well as training inputs (for exam-
ple, two to three days per trainee were estimated for training
primary care doctors and case managers in psychotropic med-
ication management). Patient-level resource inputs included
medication regimens (for example, fluoxetine, 20 milligrams
daily), laboratory tests (for example, lithium blood levels),
primary care visits (including any contacts with a case manager),
and hospital outpatient and inpatient care. Estimated patient-
levelresourceinputsforeachof thefourdisorderswereinformed
by empirical economic evaluative studies (for example,Patel and
others2003;SrinivasaMurthyandothers2005)aswellasamulti-
national Delphi consensus study of resource use for psychiatric
disorders in seven developing countries (Ferri and others 2004).
Region-specific unit costs or prices were applied to all resource
inputs (see Mulligan and others 2003) to give an annual cost for
each case as well as for all cases at the specified level of treatment
Mental Disorders | 613
coverage. Costs incurred over the 10-year implementation peri-
od were discounted at 3 percent and expressed in U.S. dollars
(rather than international dollars, which attempt to adjust for
differences in purchasing power between countries).
Coverage
In each World Bank region, treatment costs and effects were
ascribed to the population in need, both at current levels
of intervention coverage and at a scaled-up, target level of
coverage (80 percent for schizophrenia, 50 percent for the other
conditions). Target coverage levels were predicated on the basis
of what could feasibly be achieved given existing rates of treat-
ment (Ferri and others 2004; Kohn and others 2004), as well as
on prerequisites for increased coverage, such as recognition of
common mental disorders in primary care. Estimation of cur-
rent regional levels of effective coverage is hampered by lack of
data; nevertheless, an attempt was made to approximate the
expected proportion of the diseased population receiving
evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial treatments
(Ferri and others 2004; Kohn and others 2004), plus those in
contact with traditional healers (the effectiveness of which was
conservatively approximated by ascribing a placebo effect size
for each disorder).
Results
Tables 31.3 through 31.6 provide estimates of the population-
level effects (measured in DALYs averted), costs, and cost-
effectiveness of each intervention by world region for the four
types of psychiatric disorder considered in this chapter.A num-
ber of key findings emerge from this analysis.
Treatment Effectiveness. Results for schizophrenia and bipo-
lar disorder are similar (albeit at differing coverage levels),rang-
ing from less than 100 DALYs averted per 1 million population
under the current situation in Sub-Saharan Africa and South
Asia to 350 to 400 DALYs averted per 1 million population for

combination drug and psychosocial interventions in Europe
and Central Asia and East Asia and the Pacific. Second-
generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs were considered
slightly more effective than first-generation drugs (on the basis
of a modest intrinsic efficacy difference and differences in
tolerability and adherence); lithium was considered modestly
more effective as a mood-stabilizing drug than valproate (on the
basis of its additional positive effect on suicide rates). Adjuvant
psychosocial treatment in combination with pharmacotherapy
significantly added to expected population-level health gain.
With the exception of Europe and CentralAsia,less than 10 per-
centof thediseaseburdencurrentlyisbeingaverted,whereasthe
implementation of combined interventions at a scaled-up level
of coverage is expected to avert 14 to 22 percent of the burden of
schizophrenia (coverage level, 80 percent) and 17 to 29 percent
of the burden of bipolar disorder (coverage level, 50 percent).
For primary care treatment of common mental disorders,
including depression and panic disorder, current levels of effec-
tive coverage avert only 3 to 8 percent of the existing disease
burden, whereas scaling up of the most effective interventions
to a coverage level of 50 percent could be expected to avert
more than 20 percent of the burden of depression and up to
one-third of the burden of panic disorder. Considered at a pop-
ulation level, episodic treatments for depressive episodes did
not differ substantially within regions (averting 10 to15 percent
of current burden); more substantial health gain is expected
by providing maintenance treatment to individuals with recur-
rent depression (approximately 1,200 to 1,900 DALYs averted
per 1 million population; 18 to 23 percent of burden). Such an
approach has been found to reduce the risk of relapse by half.
Although the evidence to date from developing regions is mea-
ger, our results suggest that SSRIs such as fluoxetine, alone or in
combination with psychosocial treatment, are the most effec-
tive treatments for panic disorder, with health gains consider-
ably better than those estimated for benzodiazepine anxiolytic
drugs such as alprazolam.
Treatment Costs. Community-based service models for
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were found to be apprecia-
bly less costly than hospital-based service models (for example,
interventions for bipolar disorder were 25 to 40 percent less
costly). The total cost per capita of community-based outpa-
tient treatment with first-generation antipsychotic or mood-
stabilizing drugs, including all patient-level resource needs as
well as infrastructural support, ranged from US$0.40 to
US$0.50 in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to US$1.20 to
US$1.90 in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Europe
and Central Asia (equivalent patient costs per year, US$170 to
US$300 and US$300 to US$800, respectively). The cost per
capita for interventions using second-generation (atypical)
antipsychotic drugs still under patent is much higher (US$2.50
to US$5.00). By contrast, some of the newer antidepressant
drugs (SSRIs) are now off patent, and their use in treating
depression and panic disorder was accordingly costed at their
generic, nonbranded price. The patient-level cost of treating a
6-month episode of depression ranged from as little as US$30
(older antidepressants in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia) to
US$150 (newer antidepressants in combination with brief psy-
chotherapy in Latin America and the Caribbean). Total annual
costs for all incidents of depressive episodes receiving treat-
ment, including training and other program-level costs, were as
much as US$2 to US$5 per capita for a maintenance treatment
program using newer antidepressants, three times more costly
than episodic treatment with newer antidepressant drugs only.
Patient-level resource inputs for panic disorder interventions
cost US$50 to US$200 per case per year, and overall costs
including program costs of training and administration
amounted to US$0.10 to US$0.30 per capita.
Cost-Effectiveness. Compared with both the current situation
and the epidemiological situation of no treatment (natural his-
tory), the most cost-effective strategy for averting the burden of
psychosis and severe affective disorders in developing countries
is expected to be a combined intervention of first-generation
antipsychotic or mood-stabilizing drugs with adjuvant psy-
chosocial treatment delivered through a community-based
outpatient service model, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of
below US$2,000 in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, rising
to US$5,000 in Latin America and the Caribbean (equivalent to
more than 500 DALYs averted per US$1 million expenditure in
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and 200 DALYs averted in
Latin America and the Caribbean). Currently, the high acquisi-
tion price of second-generation antipsychotic drugs makes
their use in developing regions questionable on efficiency
grounds, although this situation can be expected to change as
these drugs come off patent. By contrast, evidence indicates
that the relatively modest additional cost of adjuvant psy-
chosocial treatment reaps significant health gains, thereby
making such a combined strategy for schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder treatment more cost-effective than pharma-
cotherapy alone.
For more common mental disorders treated in primary care
settings (depressive and anxiety disorders), the single most
cost-effective strategy is the scaled-up use of older antidepres-
sants (because of their lower cost but similar efficacy compared
with newer antidepressants). However, as the price margin
between older and generic newer antidepressants continues to
diminish, generic SSRIs—which have milder side effects and
are more likely to be taken at a therapeutic dose (Pereira and
Patel 1999)—can be expected to be at least as cost-effective
and, therefore, the pharmacological treatment of choice in the
future. Because depression is often a recurring condition,
proactive care management, including long-term maintenance
treatment with antidepressant drugs, represents a cost-effective
way of significantly reducing the enormous burden of depres-
sion that exists in developing regions now (400 to 1,300 DALYs
averted per US$1 million expenditure).
POLICY AND SERVICE IMPLICATIONS
Many attempts have been made during the past 50 years to
have mental health care placed higher on national and interna-
tional agendas. In 1974, a WHO Expert Committee on the
Mental Disorders | 619
Organization of Mental Health Services in Developing
Countries (WHO 1975) made the following recommendations:
•
Develop a national mental health policy and create a unit
within the Health Ministry to implement it.
•
Budget for workforce development, essential drug procure-
ment, infrastructure development, data collection, and
research.
•
Decentralize service provision and integrate mental health
into primary health care.
•
Train and supervise primary health care providers in mental
health using specialist mental health staff.
Thirty years later, international agencies, nongovernmental
organizations, and professional bodies continue to make those
exact recommendations. One reason for the lack of action in
mental health has been the paucity of information on the cost-
effectiveness of mental health interventions. Advocacy without
the necessary science can readily be ignored in countries with
massive health problems and meager resources. This chapter
aims to address this deficiency.
Symptoms of mental disorders are often attributed to other
illnesses, and mental disorders are often not considered health
problems (Jacob 2001). Many nonscientific explanations for
mental illness exist, and stigma exists to varying degrees every-
where (Weiss and others 2001) with widespread delays or fail-
ure to seek appropriate care (James and others 2002).
When care is sought, a hierarchy of interventions comes into
play, ranging from self-help, informal community support, tra-
ditional healers, primary health care, specialist community
mental health care, and psychiatric units in general hospitals to
specialist long-stay mental hospitals. The mix of interventions
depends on the availability of resources within a country or
region (Saxena and Maulik 2003). The more resource-
constrained the country or region is, the greater is the reliance
on self-help, informal community support (especially family-
based), and primary health care.
Traditional healers are often the first source individuals with
mental illness and their families turn to for professional assis-
tance (see,for example,Abiodun 1995).A recent review of com-
mon mental disorders among primary health clinics and tradi-
tional healers in urban Tanzania showed that the prevalence of
common mental disorders among those attending traditional
healerswasdoublethatof patientsatprimaryhealthcarecenters
(Ngoma, Prince, and Mann 2003). Traditional healers are a het-
erogeneous group and include faith healers, spiritual healers,
religious healers, and practitioners of indigenous or alternative
systems of medicine. In some countries, they are part of the
informalhealthsector,butinothercountries,traditionalhealers
charge for their services and should be considered part of the
private health care sector. Often, traditional healers have high
acceptability and are accessible; at times, traditional healers
work closely (and apparently effectively) with conventional
mentalhealthservices(Thara,Padmavati,andSrinivasan2004).
Alternatively, animosity and competition can exist, and recent
examples of human rights violations by traditional healers
demonstrate the heterogeneity of this group of providers.
The formal diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
occur in both primary and specialist health services. Examples
in nearly a dozen countries now show it is feasible and practi-
cable to treat common mental disorders in primary health care
settings (for example, Chisholm and others 2000; De Jong
1996; Mohit and others 1999). The challenge is to enhance sys-
tems of care by taking effective local models and disseminating
them throughout a country.
Concern has been expressed that the more sophisticated
psychotherapies used in mental health care are beyond the
human resources of developing countries. However, basic psy-
chological therapies can be effective, though there is some evi-
dence, at least for depression, that the newer drug therapies are
more cost-effective than psychological therapies (Patel and
others 2003). Psychoeducational family intervention has been
shown to be suitable for rehabilitation in schizophrenia in rural
China (Ran and others 2003) and to be cost-effective compared
with other standard treatment (Xiong and others 1994).
Evidence also shows that nurses can replace physicians as pri-
mary health care providers in certain circumstances without
loss of effectiveness (Climent and others 1978). Primary care
practitioners need support to develop skills and experience in
diagnosing and treating mental disorders: they need a sustain-
able supply of medicines, access to supervision, and incentives
to see patients with mental illness (Abas and others 2003).
Community approaches using low-cost, locally available
resources may improve treatment adherence and clinical out-
comes even in rural and underresourced settings (Chatterjee
and others 2003; Srinivasa Murthy and others 2005).
In most countries, acute inpatient beds are being moved
from mental hospitals into general or district hospitals.
Although this policy potentially improves accessibility and
increases the links with, and support provided to, primary
mental health care, concerns can be raised as to whether gen-
eral hospitals can adapt to provide adequate services to people
with severe mental disorders. However, such services have
been effectively established in a number of countries (see, for
example, Alem and others 1999; Kilonzo and Simmons 1998),
showing this form of service delivery to be feasible when it is
clinically indicated.
Nongovernmental organizations are important providers of
mental health care. An estimated 93 percent of African and
80 percent of Southeast Asian countries have nongovernmental
organizations in the mental health sector. They provide diverse
services—including advocacy, informal support, housing,
suicide prevention, substance misuse counseling, dementia
support, rehabilitation, research, and other programs—that
620 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Steven Hyman, Dan Chisholm, Ronald Kessler, and others
complement, or in some cases substitute for, public and private
clinical services (Levkoff, Macarthur, and Bucknall 1995; Patel
and Thara 2003).
Services for children and adolescents, the majority of the
population in many developing countries, are even more defi-
cient than those for adults. Priority needs to be given to these
services (Rahman and others 2000). At the other end of the life
spectrum, many developing countries are facing aging popula-
tions with grossly underdeveloped aged care services (Levkoff,
Macarthur, and Bucknall 1995). The high level of civil conflict
and natural disasters requires attention to postconflict and
posttrauma mental health conditions. The prevalence of these
disorders is demonstrated by a recent study (Livanou, Basoglu,
and Kalendar 2002) showing that, of 1,000 survivors of the
August 1999 earthquake in Turkey, the incidence of PTSD was
63 percent and of depression was 42 percent.
Specialist mental health providers, especially mental hospi-
tals, tend to focus the services they provide on the lower-
prevalence, higher-disability disorders, such as schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder. Modern treatments, if available and used,
allow most patients to be treated effectively out of hospital.
Specifically, the use of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing
drugs and the development of strategies for community-based
treatment have led to the closing of large numbers of psychi-
atric inpatient beds in many countries and their replacement
with community services and general hospital psychiatric units
(for example, Larrobla and Botega 2001).
However, in some countries, the majority of psychotic
patients remain in long-term inpatient facilities that engage in
custodial care, which is often of poor quality; moreover, basic
rights are often violated at such facilities (van Voren and
Whiteford 2000). Even if the quality of care is reasonable, acces-
sibility is a problem: these hospitals are often situated in urban
areas, but populations are largely rural and have limited trans-
portation (Saraceno and others 1995). Furthermore, the con-
centration of resources in these facilities can leave little for
other service components (Gallegos and Montero 1999). For
example, in Indonesia, 97 percent of the mental health budget
is spent on public mental hospitals (Trisnantoro 2002). For
many developing countries, the debate about the role of, or
problems with, mental hospitals is subsumed within a gross
deficiency of psychiatric beds of any kind.
The priority for virtually all countries is generating suffi-
cient resources for primary mental health care and deciding
how to expand and best use scarce specialist resources. The
quality of care is often very poor, and huge variations exist in
resource availability between countries (Saxena and Maulik
2003; WHO 2001). Very few countries have what could be con-
sidered an optimal mix of these services, and there are no uni-
versally accepted planning parameters. However, conceptual
models for developing national mental health policy and
guidelines for service planning exist that can be useful in
developing countries (Tansella and Thornicroft 1998;
Townsend and others 2004; WHO 2003).
CONCLUSION: PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR A 
COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION PACKAGE 
In developing countries, much of the mental health care spend-
ing is reported to be out of pocket. Individuals purchase mod-
ern and traditional treatments if they can afford to do so.
Although a large private health sector exists in low-income
countries (Mills and others 2002), the quality and cost vary.
Although unregulated markets fail in health, they fail even
more in mental health. It is unlikely that a country will be able
to rely on an unregulated private sector to deliver services that
will reduce the burden of mental disorders.
In addition to being a large and growing component of dis-
ease burden, mental disorders meet virtually all the criteria by
which we determine the need for government involvement in
health care (Beeharry and others 2002). They affect the poor,
cause externalities, and inflict catastrophic costs; moreover, pri-
vate demand is inadequate. Indeed, the authors recognize that
the main measure of outcome used in this and other chapters—
the disability-adjusted life year—is limited to capturing change
in service user–level symptoms, disability, recovery, and case-
fatality. The DALY does not capture the positive change that
treatment may have on a number of other significant conse-
quences of mental disorders, including family burden (in par-
ticular, productive time and household resources given up in
the care of the sick family member) and lost productivity, at the
level of both the individual and the household (treatment accel-
erates return to paid work or usual household activities) and,by
implication, at the level of society in general. The evidence base
for these productivity increases, although modest in volume,
constitutes an important additional argument alongside “cost
per DALY” considerations for investing in mental health.
The total budgetary requirements and health consequences
of a cost-effective package of mental health care can begin to be
mapped out by selecting one intervention for each of the four
disorders considered in this chapter. Although the data avail-
able for this exercise have limitations and will need to be refined
with further research, table 31.7 summarizes the estimated
costs and effects of a package consisting of (a) outpatient-based
treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with first-gen-
eration antipsychotic or mood-stabilizing drugs and adjuvant
psychosocial treatment, (b) proactive care of depression in pri-
mary care with generic SSRIs (including maintenance treat-
ment of recurrent episodes), and (c) treatment of panic disor-
der in primary care with generic SSRIs.The estimated benefit of
such a package would be an annual reduction of 2,000 to 3,000
DALYs per 1 million population, at a cost of US$3 million to
US$9 million (that is, US$3 to US$4 per capita in Sub-Saharan
Mental Disorders | 621
622 | Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries | Steven Hyman, Dan Chisholm, Ronald Kessler, and others
Africa and South Asia, and US$7 to US$9 per capita in Latin
America and the Caribbean). Accordingly, for every US$1 mil-
lion invested in such a mental health care package, 350 to 700
healthy years of life would be gained over what would occur
without intervention.
At a country level, data such as those presented in this chap-
ter can be used to estimate the proportion of burden currently
averted, the proportion that can be averted with current knowl-
edge and optimal coverage, and the burden not able to be
averted with current knowledge. Such modeling has been done
for some countries (for example, Andrews and others 2004).
Although much remains to be learned about the etiology
and treatment of mental disorders, the potential clearly exists
for a considerable reduction in the burden caused by them.
For these gains to be made, the challenge is to overcome the
cultural, financial, and structural barriers that prevent people
from seeking and receiving treatment. We need to close the gap
between what we know and what we do in treating mental dis-
orders. We can alleviate the substantial burden of these disor-
ders and reverse or limit many of the devastating social and
economic impacts.
